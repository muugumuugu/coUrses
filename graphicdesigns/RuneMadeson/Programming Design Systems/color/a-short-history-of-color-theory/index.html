  <h1>A short history of color theory</h1>
</header>

  <p>
    Of all the subjects presented in this book, this part devoted to color
    theory might be the most perplexing one. Although a basic understanding of
    the color spectrum is rather easy to develop, color theory is an almost
    infinitely complex subject with roots in both science and art. It can
    therefore be a daunting task to learn about color composition in a way that
    is true to both art history and scientific truth, and I have seen many
    designers stumbling on the most basic of questions: Is yellow a primary
    color? Which color combinations are harmonic? What is the true complementary
    color to blue?
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope that this chapter on the history of color theory can help answer some
    of these questions by highlighting both the mistakes and successes of key
    figures in the field. In this abbreviated and narrow introduction, I am
    especially interested in the conflict between the two distinct but related
    fields that both operate under the term &#x2018;color theory&#x2019;: Artistic color
    theory, which is concerned with the visual effects of color combination in
    the fine arts, and scientific color theory, which describes the nature of
    color through increasingly complex but precise color models. The following
    chapters will build on lessons learned in this chapter, and it is my belief
    that it is essential for designers to develop a solid understanding of this
    history in order to make good decisions about color.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the first known theories about color can be found in
    <em>On Colors</em>, a short text written in ancient Greece. The text was
    originally attributed to Aristotle, but it is now widely accepted to have
    been written by members of his Peripatetic school. Based on observations of
    how color behaves in nature, the text argues that all colors exist in a
    spectrum between darkness and light, and that four primary colors come from
    the four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. This can seem rather weird
    and speculative today, but these observations made sense at the time: A
    plant is green above ground and white in its roots, thus the color must come
    from the sun. Likewise, a plant left to dry will lose its vivid colors, thus
    water provides color too. This theory is typical of how color theorists for
    centuries used color to establish a general theory of the universe. Despite
    the erroneous theory, <em>On Colors</em> has a series of important
    observations, like the fact that &#x201C;darkness is not a colour at all, but
    is merely an absence of light&#x201D;<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn1">1</a></span>
    &#x2013; a discovery propelled by watching how clouds darken as they thicken<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn2">2</a></span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like so many other areas of science, Isaac Newton completely redefined the
    conventional theories on the behavior of light when he published the first
    edition of <em>Opticks</em> in 1704. Rather than seeing light as a void of
    color, Newton discovered that white light is a combination of all colors
    across the color spectrum. The basics of his experiments was a well-known
    phenomena: When you shine white light through a prism, the light is split
    into colors from across the color spectrum. However, Newton discovered that
    he could recombine these spectral colors to once again turn them into white
    light.
  </p>

  <figure class="left">
    <img src="../../assets/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/newton-color-circle.jpg">
    <figcaption>
      Newton&apos;s color circle used seven colors mapped to a musical octave
      starting at the tone D.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Newton also discovered that if he blended the first color (red) and last
    color (violet) of the color spectrum, he could produce magenta, an
    extra-spectral color that does not exist in the rainbow. This prompted him
    to wrap the color spectrum into a circle, beginning a tradition of using
    basic shapes to represent the relationship between colors. Newton used a
    circle because it could be used to predict the result of color mixing for
    two colors by pointing to the color midway between these colors. The colors
    on Newton&#x2019;s circle have asymmetric distances to each other because Newton
    wanted the circle to have seven colors &#x2013; the exact number of days in a week
    and musical notes in an octave<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn3">3</a></span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Newton was interested in a scientific explanation of color, the German
    poet Wolfgang von Goethe dedicated his book <em>Theory of Colors</em> from
    1810 to a more human-centered analysis of the perception of color. Through a
    series of experiments that measured the eye&#x2019;s response to certain colors,
    Goethe created what is arguably the most famous color circle of all time.
    The circle had three primary colors &#x2013; magenta, yellow, and blue &#x2013; which he
    believed could mix all other colors in the spectrum.
  </p>

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This publication was in many ways at odds with Newton&#x2019;s theories, as Goethe
    believed that the prism, not the light, was responsible for the creation of
    color, and that darkness was not an absence of light. Although Newton
    eventually won the argument about the nature of light, Goethe&#x2019;s work is
    important to us because it focuses on the cognitive effect that color has on
    humans. His research on the effects of after-images and optical illusions is
    especially interesting, because it points towards the later works of
    Johannes Itten and Josef Albers<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn4">4</a></span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though Newton&apos;s and Goethe&#x2019;s color circles may seem to be at odds with
    each other, they are in some way both correct as they illustrate the
    behavior of color in different material. Newton describes how his spectral
    colors can mix most visible colors including white, and this is true because
    light mixes in an additive way: Combining lights of different colors will
    eventually result in white light. Goethe describes how his three primary
    colors can mix most visible colors including black, and this is true because
    pigments mix in a subtractive way: Combining paints of different colors will
    eventually result in black paint by subtracting waves of light.

  <p>
    In a quest to create a unified notation for color &#x2013; like we know it from
    musical notation &#x2013; artists soon started depicting the color spectrum as 3D
    solids. A concurrent example of this can be found in Tobias Mayer&#x2019;s color
    triangle from his book <em>The Affinity of Color Commentary</em>, published
    posthumously in 1775. Mayer sought to accurately define the number of
    individual colors the human eye can see, and this required him to add
    another dimension to represent the variations of brightness for each color.
    Mayer painted the corners of a triangle with the three traditional primary
    colors from painting &#x2013; red, yellow, and blue &#x2013; and connected the corners by
    mixing the opposing colors together. Unlike the traditional color circle, he
    created many variations of this triangle by stacking triangles of different
    brightnesses on top of each other. This made it possible to define a color
    by its position within a 3D space, a technique still used to this day. Mayer
    ultimately failed at creating a color model with perceptually uniform steps,
    as he did not understand the irregularities of the human eye<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn5">5</a></span>.

  </figure>

  <p>
    The German painter Philipp Otto Runge took this same approach when creating
    his spherical representation of the color spectrum, published in his
    <em>Color Sphere</em> manuscript in 1810. Runge&#x2019;s sphere had white and black
    poles with colored bands running between them. However, like many other
    representations of color before it, the model did not differentiate between
    brightness and saturation, which meant that the resulting model had little
    variation in color intensity. This sphere had the same problem as Mayer&#x2019;s
    triangle, as the steps were not perceptually uniform<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn6">6</a></span>.

  </figure>

  <p>
    Michel Eug&#xE8;ne Chevreul attempted to fix this problem in his hemispherical
    color system from 1839. Rather than mixing colors by focusing on the amount
    of paint used, he based his selections solely on what perceptually appeared
    to be the correct mixture. Inspired by the work of Goethe, Chevreul used
    after-images to test the validity of his mixtures. When a person stares at a
    green square for a long time and then looks at a white wall, a magenta
    square will appear. This happens because of fatigue in the green
    photoreceptors in the eye, and Chevreul used this to establish the
    complementary colors in his model<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn7">7</a></span>.

  <p>
    One of the most historically significant color solids was created by the
    American painter Albert Henry Munsell in the early 1900&#x2019;s. Like his peers
    before him, Munsell wanted to create a model with perceptually uniform
    steps, and although he was a painter, his approach was very scientific: He
    used human test subjects and a range of mechanical instruments he invented
    to create a remarkably accurate model. One important detail about Munsell&#x2019;s
    color system is that he divided the color space into three new dimensions:
    The hue determined the type of color (red, blue, etc), the value determined
    the brightness of the color (light or dark), and the chroma determined the
    saturation of the color (the purity of the color). These dimensions are
    still used to this day in some representations of the RGB color model.
  </p>

      renotation.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Munsell first tried to arrange his colors in a sphere, but noted that
    &#x201C;the desire to fit a chosen contour, such as the pyramid, cone, or
    cube, coupled with a lack of proper tests, has led to many distorted
    statements of colour relations&#x201D;<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn8">8</a></span>. Essentially, Munsell realized that his color solid had to have an
    irregular shape to fit his colors. The explanation for this is rather
    simple. Colors with low brightness have much fewer visible colors between
    zero and full saturation (colors with zero brightness only have one, black).
    Likewise, some hues have more range than others. You can mix more visible
    colors between red and white than between yellow and white, because yellow
    is a lighter color. Another important detail of Munsell&#x2019;s color system is
    that he prefered the use of a mathematical syntax over color names to
    indicate a color&#x2019;s position within the color space. This is not unlike how
    we define colors in programming languages today. Munsell&#x2019;s color system had
    its flaws and inconsistencies, but it managed to bridge art and science in a
    way not done before, and it still forms the basis of the curriculum at many
    fine art institutions.

  <p>
    Many of the European art movements in the early 20th century had a profound
    interest in the subjective experience of art, and although the Bauhaus
    school in Germany was a school focused on a modern approach to art, design,
    and architecture, two important publications on color and perception were
    written by Bauhaus faculty: <em>The Art of Color</em> by Johannes Itten<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn9">9</a></span>
    and <em>Interaction of Color</em> by Josef Albers<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn10">10</a></span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a follower of the Mazdaznan religion, Itten&#x2019;s view of the arts was highly
    influenced by his spiritual beliefs. Following a strict vegetarian diet, he
    was famous for performing rhythmic breathing exercises with his students in
    order to have them realize their full creative potential<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn11">11</a></span>. In his mind &#x2013; like Goethe&#x2019;s &#x2013; it was the subjective experience of color
    that mattered, and his book focuses on how color can be combined to invoke
    feelings in the viewer. The central idea in Itten&#x2019;s work is the existence of
    seven color contrasts that artists must master in order to know the effect
    of their color choices. Some of these contrasts are simple, like the
    contrast of light and dark that exists when colors of different brightnesses
    appear next to each other, or the contrast of hue that can be seen when
    colors of different hues are used together<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn12">12</a></span>. These observations can still be used by aspiring designers to guide
    decisions around color, as they give us a way to classify color and think
    systematically about their use. Itten even operated with a RYB color sphere
    remarkably similar to that of Runge to help explain these ideas. Other of
    Itten&#x2019;s contrasts can seem rather arbitrary, like his law of simultaneous
    contrast that states how certain colors create visual effects when used
    together. Itten often uses his own subjective experience to establish a
    generalized theory on color and perception, as demonstrated in the quote
    below.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="text-width">

      &#x201C;For the solution of many problems, however, there are objective
      considerations that outweigh subjective preferences. Thus a meat market
      may be decorated in light green and blue-green tones, so that the various
      meats will appear fresher and redder. [...] If a commercial artist were to
      design a package for coffee bearing yellow and white stripes, or one with
      blue polka-dots for spaghetti, he would be wrong because these form and
      color features are in conflict with the theme.&#x201D;
    </p>
    <cite>Johannes Itten<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn13">13</a></span></cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Here, Itten&#x2019;s personal preferences towards the color palette bleed into an
    unnecessarily strict generalization about color and subject. Who is to say
    that yellow stripes or blue polka-dots cannot be used effectively when
    designing food product labeling?
  </p>

  <p>
    Josef Albers, a student of Itten&#x2019;s at the Bauhaus, took a more demonstrative
    approach in his <em>Interaction of Color</em> from 1963. Using opaque pieces
    of colored paper, Albers sets out to show the highly dynamic nature of
    color, particularly how humans tend to perceive a color based on the colors
    around it. Rather than trying to establish some unified theory about why
    color behaves this way, Albers describes how students can repeat these
    experiments to experience it on their own. This has made
    <em>The Interaction of Color</em> one of the most important and timeproof
    books on color composition. Pictured below is one of his most famous
    examples with two small squares on colored backgrounds. The viewer naturally
    assumes that the squares are filled with colors from the opposite
    backgrounds, when they in reality are the exact same color.

  <p>
    As illustrated above, our art history is full of arguments over the nature
    of primary colors, which is in part caused by the confusion over subtractive
    and additive color models. It is notoriously hard to mix yellow from darker
    paints, which is why Goethe and other artists thought of yellow as a &#x2018;pure&#x2019;
    color with qualities different from the rest of the color spectrum. We know
    today that the concept of primary colors is actually a rather arbitrary one,
    and there is no such thing as &#x2018;pure&#x2019; primary colors for pigments. One can
    choose any three colors to mix a subset of the spectrum, and although some
    primaries can mix a wider range of colors, it is impossible to mix the
    entire visible color spectrum in a subtractive color model.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="text-width">
    <p>
      &#x201C;The conclusion [...] is that primary colors are only useful
      fictions. They are either imaginary variables adopted by mathematical
      models of color vision, or they are imperfect but economical compromises
      adopted for specific color mixing purposes with lights, paints, dyes or
      inks.&#x201D;
    </p>
    <cite>Bruce MacEvoy<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn14">14</a></span></cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    These discoveries are deeply integrated into the devices that we all use on
    a daily basis. The industry standard for desktop printers and other
    pigment-based printing mechanisms with subtractive color mixing is to have
    three colors based on the CMY color model: cyan, magenta, and yellow. It is
    now well understood that this particular set of colors can mix an acceptable
    range of colors in ink. Printers also have a black ink because these primary
    colors cannot mix to a true black, and it has the added advantage of saving
    costly colored ink. However, professional printers can have many more ink
    cartridges for better color accuracy. Epson, a leader in digital printing
    technologies, uses ten ink colors in their UltraChrome&#xAE; HDR technology.

      Additive RGB and subtractive CMY share complementary colors.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The industry standard for computer screens and other light-based display
    technologies with additive color mixing is to have three primaries per pixel
    based on the RGB color model: red, green, and blue. These three colors mix
    to an acceptable range of the visible color spectrum, where the exact amount
    is decided by the quality of the monitor, but also the computer&#x2019;s graphics
    card. Any digital design tool today will allow designers to define colors
    based on a combination of these three primaries. A special bonus of the RGB
    and CMY color models is that even though they have different primary colors,
    they share complementary colors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like there is common agreement on the scientific nature of color today,
    it is also known that the human experience of color is a highly complex and
    subjective phenomenon. It is generally accepted that it is impossible to
    create a simple, predictive theory about color harmony &#x2013; the type of
    approach that Goethe and Itten believed in. A number of factors determine
    your response to a specific combination of colors, including gender, age,
    mood, personal background, and current trends in society<span data-type="footnote"><a href="index.html#fn15">15</a></span>. In some sense, this should be a relief to aspiring designers. For one, it
    relieves them from participating in irrelevant discussions about which color
    circle has the &#x2018;correct&#x2019; complementary colors. Also, without a simple
    algorithm to find harmonic colors, the student has no choice but to use
    their own eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When reading this account of artists and scientists who dedicated their
    professional lives to the creation of models that help other artists make
    educated decisions about color composition, it should be clear that the way
    designers today interact with color &#x2013; the color picker &#x2013; leaves much to be
    desired. The color picker is as omnipresent as it is broken: With no
    significant changes over the last decade, it fails to provide a meaningful
    visual representation of the color spectrum, even though such models has
    existed for more than 300 years. Instead, it uses a rectangular area to show
    a single hue at a time, and designers are left with no way to visualize the
    relationship between the selected colors, or even understand the difference
    between a perceptually uniform color model and its counterpart. The
    consequence is that this entire history of color theory is neglected in
    modern design tools, which means that it is lost on students too.

  <p>
    Luckily, we are not bound to digital design tools in this book. In the
    following chapters, we will examine color models, color spaces, and many
    techniques that can be used to generate color schemes in code. In order to
    not make the same mistakes as the people before us, these chapters will not
    seek to propose a unified theory about which colors are best for certain
    scenarios. Instead, we will get to know the color palette, and learn how to
    see the effects of different color combinations. This will hopefully lead to
    students developing a sound theoretical foundation upon which to base their
    practice.
