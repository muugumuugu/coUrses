This is a collection of examples extracted from the chapters of this book together with shared shaders kindly donated by other readers using [the on-line editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/). Feel free to explore and tweak them bit by bit. Once you have something you are proud of, click the "Export" and then copy the "URL to code...". Send it to [@bookofshaders](https://twitter.com/bookofshaders) or [@kyndinfo](https://twitter.com/kyndinfo). We are looking forward to see it!
