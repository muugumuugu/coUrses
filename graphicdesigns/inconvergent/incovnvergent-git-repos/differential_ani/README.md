Differential
=============

The Differential algorithm is inspired by the way a number of biological things
in nature grows. Among other things it is made to mimic the way the human brain
grows, as well as a great number of plants. In brief; we start of with a number
of connected nodes in a circle. Gradually we introduce new nodes on the
lineâ€”prioritizing segments where the curve bends more sharply. Over time the
curve grows increasingly intricate, but it never self-intersects.
