# Shepherding Random Numbers

My website: 
https://inconvergent.net

I post a lot of work on twitter:
https://twitter.com/inconvergent

A lot of my code is on Github
https://github.com/inconvergent/

_Warning_: The repositories on Github are all more or less works in progress.
They represent my ideas and experimentation. That means there may be breaking
changes with no warning. It also means that I am unlikely to accept pull
requests. Since (almost) all the Github repositories are MIT licensed you are
quite free to experiment with it as you wish.
