# Inconvergent Utils

This library is a collection of useful functions I find myself re-implementing
across repositories when working with generative algorithms.

## Requirements

 - gi (Replaces pyGTK, probably included in python3?)
 - cairo (Sorry about that ... )
 - numpy (installed via setup.py)
 - scipy (installed via setup.py)
