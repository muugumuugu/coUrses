# Differential Mesh 3d

![ani](/img/ani.gif?raw=true "ani")


Differential Mesh is an extension of the Hyphae
(https://github.com/inconvergent/hyphae) algorithm. I started working on it
with the intention of mimicking the growth of (certain types of) lichen.

This three dimensional extension is something else entirely ...
