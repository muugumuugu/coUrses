  constructor for grp instances.

  grps are edge graphs.

  nil is the default grp. as such, nil is not an allowed grp name (there is
  always a default grp named nil). if name is nil, the name will be a gensym.

  edges can be associated with multiple grps.

  verts are global. that is, they do not belong to any grp on their own.
  however, if a vert is associated with an edge, that vert is also associated
  with whatever grp that edge belongs to.

    - to get verts in a grp: (get-grp-verts wer :g g).
    - to get indices of verts (in a grp): (get-vert-inds wer :g g)
    - ...

  the grp functionality is somewhat experimental.
