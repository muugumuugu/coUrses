<h1 class="dark"><a href="index.html">Some thoughts on
Generative Art</a></h1>
<p>
The following is a combination of segments from a few different talks I've
given <a class="footnote-counter" href="index.html#footnotes"></a>. It touches
briefly on the history of generative art, as well as some of my experience
with it.
</p>
<p>
If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to generative art, you
will unfortunately have to keep looking, but I want to mention some things
I wish I had been aware of earlier.

<p>
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">Wikipedia</a>,
generative art is made by a process that has some level of autonomy.
The role of the artist is to design or influence this process to some
degree. This process can be any number of things, and as such it is not
limited to the digital realm. It can just as easily be a system driven by a
chemical reaction. Or a set of rules for coloring in a checkered sheet of
paper.
</p>
<p>
When I use the word <em>generative</em> I tend to mean that some kind of
randomness is involved, however I do not believe this to be a requirement
<a class="footnote-counter" href="index.html#footnotes"></a>. I have little interest
in a strict definition of these terms, so instead I will just mention that
there are several terms that seem to be used be people who work within
different disciplines. Often they refer to a set of intersecting ideas <a class="footnote-counter" href="index.html#footnotes"></a>. This includes, but is
not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Generative</li>
<li>Algorithmic</li>
<li>Procedural (Art)</li>
<li>Procedural Generation (PCG/ProcGen)</li>
<li>Parametric or Computer-Aided Design</li>
<li>Computational Art/Architecture/Design</li>
<li>Computer (Art)</li>
</ul>
<p>
In some sense I would argue that it does not really matter whether you are
generating characters, dialogue or environments for a computer game,
geometry as part of a building, digital or analogue art, a musical
composition, or a poem. In all cases you are using a system of some kind to
help you along. Either towards a specific goal, some unidentified result,
or somewhere in-between.
</p>
<p>
To me the main point is usually to experiment with a small system that
consists of a set of relatively simple rules. Sometimes the goal is to
recreate a particular behaviour&mdash;for instance a biological process or
some other natural phenomena&mdash;sometimes not.
</p>
<p>
My process is usually highly experimental. And while there is usually some
kind of underlying goal there is not always any interest on my part in
actually reaching that particular goal. I might be just as happy to
discover some unexpected behaviour and explore that instead. Overall this
means that the process is continuous, exploratory, and never really
complete. Naturally this process has also changed quite a lot over time.

At this point I have had some kind of interest in generative art for at
least ~ 7 years <a class="footnote-counter" href='index.html#footnotes'></a>. I
started working actively on it when I was at university, but really it
started before that.
</p>
<p>
When I was about 16 I spent a year as an exchange student in Australia. At
some point I came across <a href="http://complexification.net">complexification.net</a> by Jared
Tarbell. At the time I didn't really know enough about programming to
realise how it was done, or how to get started. As a result I mostly just
spent a whole lot of time looking at the various animations. Then I
gradually forgot about the site.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure what reminded me of the site again, but I had learnt quite a
lot of programming, so I started experimenting. Seeing as I was studying
physics and numerical mathematics it turned out I had a pretty good
foundation for this kind of programming. However, <em>because</em> I was
studying numerical mathematics I almost felt obliged to model some kind of
<em>real thing</em>. Recently I've started to realise that there is no
particular reason why I should impose this limitation on my work.

I got into generative art as a distraction at university, but people have
been doing this for far longer. Among the people frequently credited with
being part of the advent of computer art is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieder_Nake">Frieder Nake</a>. Two
others include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Michael_Noll">Michael Noll</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Nees">Georg Nees</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unbeknownst to each other these people had started making computer
generated plotter drawings based on randomness and/or rules in 1963-64.
Then, in 1965, followed three separate exhibitions: Georg Nees exhibited
work in Stuttgart in February, Noll and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Julesz">Béla Julesz</a> had
an exhibition in New York City in April, and finally, Nake and Nees
exhibited work in Stuttgart in November. If you would like a more authentic
introduction to this history I can not recommend Frieder Nake's <a href="https://vimeo.com/104315361">talk from Eyeo 2014</a> enough.<a class="footnote-counter" href="index.html#footnotes"></a>

There are two other people who's work I also find thoroughly captivating.
One is pioneering artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r">Vera Molnár</a>,
who began producing computer art in 1968. The other one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mohr">Manfred Mohr</a>, an
action painter and jazz musician, who started working with computers in
1969.

Looking at these old works is quite stunning. In some ways They are rather
minimalistic. It's easy to be tricked into believing that this is because
there is a limit to what you can do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">punch cards</a> and
plotter. However, this minimalism is an excellent way to let you really pay
attention to the intricacies of the algorithms behind it. You can clearly
see that there is some sort of pattern there, but the details are not at
all obvious.
</p>
<p>
Instead of trying to tell you how they are done, I'm simply going to say
that while we might have better tools, and more processing power today,
that does not automatically mean we can make better (generative) art. <a class="footnote-counter" href="index.html#footnotes"></a>
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in my process and work in particular you could have a
look at another text I've written: <a href="../generative/index.html">On Generative
Algorithms</a>.

None of it is verbatim, as I am completely incapable of writing a
manuscript and sticking to it.
</li>
<li>
Technically I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">
Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNG)</a>. Seeing as these generators
produce deterministic results, there is no real difference between a
program that includes this kind of randomness and a program that does
not use any randomness at all. There would be a conceptual difference
if the random numbers used were <a href="https://www.random.org/">truly
random</a>, but in the case of my work I am almost entirely certain
that you would not be able to inspect a work and decide whether it was
made using true randomness or a PRNG.
</li>
<li>
I don't mean to diminish the importance of definitions, and there may
very well be a well formulated definition of some (or all) of these
terms. However, if you are getting started it is useful to know the
terms people use, and then you can look into them on your own.

It seems I registered this domain on the 5th of August 2010. This
lends some doubt to my recollection that I registered this domain when
I was supposed to be reading for my exams; the summer semester at my
university usually had exams in May. Unless I was reading for
continuation exams, which did happen several times.

Info in this section is from the Wikipedia article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieder_Nake">Frieder Nake</a>
and <a href="https://vimeo.com/104315361">his presentation at Eyeo in
2014</a>.

Naturally we can, and should, try.
