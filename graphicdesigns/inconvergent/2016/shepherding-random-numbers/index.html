<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--googleon: all-->
<p>The following is a tiny guide to shepherding random numbers.
Originally I used this as a part of a presentation, but it
seemed like it would work well as a little text as well. It
does not really deal with statistics or probability, it is
simply a collection of a few useful tricks I've learnt for
manipulating random numbers. Usually I use the following
techniques as a part of a larger work.</p>
<p><em>This text relies on Javascript animations (Canvas). They
should work on most devices, but please let me know if you
experience any issues.</em></p>
<p><em>You can click or tap all animations to restart
them.</em></p>
<h2>Random Node</h2>
<p>We start with something very simple: a single node that moves
between random positions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-introduction"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="multiple" class="hide">
<h2>Multiple</h2>
<p>It is always useful to see what it looks like when we
introduce more things. Here are multiple independent nodes that
move in the same way as before.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-multiple"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="memory" class="hide">
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>The nodes still move at random. However, now they move
relative to their previous position, that is: they move
slightly up or down from where they are. As opposed to
previously when they would move at random to a completely new
position. One could say that they have developed a simple kind
of memory.</p>
<p>This also makes it look as if all the nodes are very nervous
about something.</p>
<p>When we look at this it can sometimes seem as if there is a
pattern emerging from the behaviour. However, if you feel like
you can see such a pattern it is entirely coincidental, since
the nodes are completely unaware of each other.</p>
<p>Whenever a node reaches the edge of the canvas, we stop it's
motion. The node will remain at the edge until it should be
inclined to start moving in the opposite direction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-memory"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="velocity" class="hide">
<h2>Velocity</h2>
<p>We now introduce the idea of velocity. Instead of moving
relative to their previous position, nodes will now move
according to their current velocity.</p>
<p>To make things a little more interesting we manipulate the
velocity in the same way that we did node position in the
previous example. That means that the velocities gradually will
change. Velocities can be either positive or negative, as you
can see indicated by the lines in the animation.</p>
<p>In this example all nodes start with a velocity of zero.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-velocity"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="sums-of-velocities" class="hide">
<h2>Sums of Velocities</h2>
<p>Until now all the nodes have been completely independent of
each other. So here is one possible way to change that. Each
node now has two associated velocities. One is the <em>regular
velocity</em>. This behaves exactly like in the previous
example. The second is the <em>special velocity</em>. The
<em>special velocity</em> is re-calculated for each frame, and
it is the sum of all the current <em>regular velocities</em> of
the nodes on it's left hand side.</p>
<p>If this seems a little arbitrary to you, it is probably
because it is. There is no obvious reason to do this, other
than the fact that it behaves rather pleasing.</p>
<p>The lines in the animation below indicate the <em>special
velocity</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-sums-of-velocities"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="more-nodes-again" class="hide">
<h2>More Nodes. Again</h2>
<p>It is time to introduce even more nodes. Adding more things
can help you see thing differently. In this case it makes it a
little easier to see the total behaviour of the system of
nodes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-more-nodes-again"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="history" class="hide">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For me the goal is frequently to make a static result. That
is, something that will make a good image. While these
animations are nice and informative, a snapshot of one of them
is not really that interesting. A way of getting different
results is by drawing behaviour over time. Showing the history
of a behaviour like we do below can also be a nice alternative
way of understanding what is happening.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-history"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="different-dimensions" class="hide">
<h2>Different Dimensions</h2>
<p>So far we have looked at behaviour along a single axis, or
dimension. Lets apply the exact same behaviour as before in two
dimensions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-different-dimensions"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="new-beginnings" class="hide">
<h2>New Beginnings</h2>
<p>Things will look quite different if we change the initial
distribution of nodes. Below we see what happens if we wrap the
nodes along the circumference of a circle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-new-beginnings"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="more-random" class="hide">
<h2>More Random</h2>
<p>It is always a good idea to experiment with adding more
randomness. One example is to distribute the nodes at random
along the circumference. The important thing to keep in mind in
this case is that since the behaviour is exactly the same as
before, there is still the same relation between the nodes'
velocities. It is just their initial position that has
changed.</p>
<p>You can probably think of a few other things to try
randomizing as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-more-random"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="conclusion" class="hide">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are just a few of the things you can do with random numbers. The
next part of this text covers some more techniques: <a href="../shepherding-random-grids/index.html">Shepherding Random
Grids</a>.</p>
