<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--googleon: all-->
<p>In <a href="../shepherding-random-numbers/index.html">Shepherding Random Numbers</a>
I introduced few ways to use random numbers to create interesting
behaviour. Here I will extend upon those ideas a little, so I recommend
reading that first. Once again this is not a rigorous look at the
mathematical concepts, it is just a collection of possible <em>generative</em> techniques.</p>
<p><em>This text relies on Javascript animations (Canvas). They
should work on most devices, but please let me know if you
experience any issues.</em></p>
<p><em>You can click or tap all animations to restart
them.</em></p>
<h2>Random Walk</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../shepherding-random-numbers/index.html#memory">previous post</a>
we already introduced a version of the behaviour typically referred to as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">Random Walk</a>. (But I
never named it. Sorry.) There are multiple definitions and versions of
Random Walks. Below is a simple version in two dimensions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-introduction"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="multiple" class="show">
<h2>Multiple</h2>
<p>Let's see what it looks like when we distribute several, independent,
nodes in a grid, and animate them all with random walks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-multiple"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="grid" class="show">
<h2>Grid</h2>
<p>Things look quite different when we draw connections between neighbors
in the grid. The behaviour is still the same. This means that the nodes are
still acting independently of each other.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-grid"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="averages" class="show">
<h2>Averages</h2>
<p>There are probably plenty of ways to make interesting things with this
system of independent nodes. However, we will move on and try to make a
connected system of some kind.</p>
<p>The obvious way is to utilize the links introduced in the previous
section somehow. You could, for instance, make the connections into
springs. That way they would basically try to keep a particular distance
from their four (two/three if they are on the boundary.) neighbors.</p>
<p>Instead of making springs, let's try something else. In the following
animation we let all nodes move towards the <em>average position</em> of
their neighbours. In addition we apply a bit of noise to this motion. The
noise is the same random walk as before, but scaled down a little, so as
not to compete too heavily with the interaction we just introduced.</p>
<p>The <span style="color: #0aa;">cyan</span> line indicates the position
of each nodes' <em>average position</em>.</p>
<p>This shows some promise. However, if we watch this for a while, it will
simply eventually collapse into the center. You can take my word for at and
read on, but it should not take too long for it to possible to see that
this happens.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-averages"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="random-averages" class="show">
<h2>Random Averages</h2>
<p>To keep things from simply collapsing, here is a different strategy.</p>
<p>We introduce a new concept of randomized averages. (If you are
mathematically inclined, this is my name for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination">linear
combination</a> where the weights are randomised.)
We give each node a weight between zero and
one. Now we use this weight to calculate the average
position introduced in the previous section.</p>
<p>In addition we let nodes be either closed (&#9679;) or open (&#3664;).
The closed nodes will move towards the average position, as before. The
open nodes will move away from the average position. The size of the circle
denotes the magnitude of the node's weight. Intuitively this means that for
two neighboring nodes, with circles of approximately the same size, the
average position will be close to the middle of the two nodes. However, if
the circles are of unequal size, the average position will be closer to the
node with the larger circle.</p>
<p>All nodes are connected to at least two other nodes, so the total effect
of this is a little complex to predict. But you can see what happens
below</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-random-averages"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="paths" class="show">
<h2>Paths</h2>
<p>Instead of displaying nodes and connections, we now draw the path of
each node as it moves through time. This quickly becomes a little chaotic,
but it does have some interesting tendencies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-paths"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="strokes" class="show">
<h2>Strokes</h2>
<p>A different way of displaying the behaviour is by drawing strokes
between each node and it's neighbors. The strokes are drawn by sampling (a
constant) number of random points between neighboring nodes for each
iteration, and drawing a transparent dot at each position. (You can read
more about this method at <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/sandstroke/">complexification.net</a>.)</p>
<p>This also breaks down into disarray eventually, but until that happens
it does display a neat kind of ordered chaos.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-strokes"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="random-positions" class="show">
<h2>Random Positions</h2>
<p>Just to see what happens, here is the exact same structure as before
with nodes initially distributed at random along the circumference of a
circle. Now the initial position of a node is completely unrelated to it's
neighbors. We can see this since the strokes between neighbors will begin
to materialize at random.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-more-strokes"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="conclusion" class="hide">
<h2>End</h2>
<p>These were a few more techniques involving structures and random numbers
that you can use to generate interesting results. Maybe you can find a way
to apply this to a project of your own.</p>
