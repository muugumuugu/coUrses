<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--googleon: all-->
<p>This is the third part of a series of texts on various methods for
creating generative art with random numbers. The first part is <a href="../shepherding-random-numbers/index.html">Shepherding Random
Numbers</a>, and the second part is <a href="../shepherding-random-grids/index.html">Shepherding Random
Grids</a>. This text does not rely too heavily on the
previous ones, but I recommend looking at them even
so.</p>
<p>In this part I will describe a simple form of differential growth. I
have written about this technique previously in my essay <a href="../../generative/index.html">On Generative Algorithms</a>.
Specifically in the following sections: <a href="../../generative/differential-line/index.html">Differential
Line</a>, <a href="../../generative/differential-mesh/index.html">Differential
Mesh</a>, <a href="generative/differential-mesh-ed/">Differential
Mesh 3d</a>. Moreover, several other people have done
similar work. My favorites are <a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/sets/floraform/">Floraform</a>
by <a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/">Nervous
System</a>, and <a href="http://www.andylomas.com/cellularFormImages.html">Cellular
Forms</a> by <a href="http://www.andylomas.com/">Andy

<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>Differential Growth is a way in which biological systems develop shape.
By controlling the rate at which different parts of a surface grows, you
can control the shape it grows into.</p>
<p>In this case we will consider lines, not surfaces. However the principle
is similar. Some good examples of shapes that inspired this particular
system are walnuts, flower petals and the layers of cabbage.</p>
<p>While differential growth in nature is a multi-layered and complicated
process, it can be simulated with only a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes and Edges</strong>: nodes are connected to a certain
number of neighboring nodes through edges.</li>
<li><strong>Attraction</strong>: connected nodes will try to maintain a
reasonably close proximity to each other. In the figure below
attraction happens between connected nodes in the loop.</li>
<li><strong>Rejection</strong>: nodes will try to avoid being too close
to surrounding nodes (within a certain distance). Rejection fores are
indicated by <span style="color: #0aa;">cyan</span> lines in the figure
below.</li>
<li><strong>Splits</strong>: If an edges gets too long, a new node will
be injected at the middle of the edge.</li>
<li><strong>Growth</strong>: in addition to the splits, new nodes are
injected according to some growth scheme. I will describe this further
soon.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="text">
<div id="uniform" class="show">
<h2>Uniform</h2>
<p>The simplest kind of growth scheme is to randomly select an edge, and
insert a new node at the middle of it. To reduce clutter, you should avoid
inserting nodes if the edge is too short. This will tend to lead to
collisions.</p>
<p>The intensity at which new nodes are inserted will greatly impact the
rate of growth as well as the shape, so there are a number of things to
experiment with.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-uniform"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="curvature" class="show">
<h2>Curvature</h2>
<p><em>This section is a little more technical.</em></p>
<p>So far the growth has been uniform. One way of introducing some
variation in growth is to prioritize parts of the structure where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>
of the surface (line) is greater. Below we indicate the curvature with
<span style="color: #0aa;">cyan</span> circles. Larger circles indicate
greater (estimated) curvature.</p>
<p>One way to estimate how much the line bends at a given point is to
compare an edge to one of it's neighbouring edges. The greater the angle
between them, the greater the curvature. The value I display in the figure
below is the following: for <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalizedVector.html<Paste>">normalized</a>
vectors (edges) <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, the curvature is
1-abs(dot(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)). I should point out that this is not
how you calculate the actual curvature.</p>
<p>The next challenge is to sample edges to split such that we tend to split
edges that have greater curvature. If we use the formula listed above, we
will get a number for the curvature between which ranges between 0 and 1. We
then generate a random number (from a uniform distribution) between 0 and 1.
We only split the edge if the edge is sufficiently long, and if this random
number is less than the value of the curvature. That way, greater curvatures
will tend to be selected more frequently. We can repeat this process for
every edge, in every iteration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-curvature"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="more-nodes" class="show">
<h2>More Nodes</h2>
<p>This process is quite computationally intensive. The most costly
operation is to find nodes that are in the vicinity of a given node, so
that you can calculate the <em>rejection</em> forces. A useful tip for
implementing this in an efficient manner is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">k-d
trees</a> for looking up nearby nodes. Most k-d tree
implementation will let you look up all entries within a
certain radius of a given point, which happens to be
exactly what you want in this case.</p>
<p>Below is a structure that will grow a little more intricate than the
previous samples.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-more-nodes"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="history" class="show">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By drawing strokes along the outline of the structure as it grows, we
get a radically different result. You should also note that we are not
restricted to closed loops, you can easily extend this logic to work with
lines, or perhaps even grids?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="canvas-container" id="container-history"></div>
<div class="text">
<div id="end" class="hide">
<h2>End</h2>
<p>Hopefully this was an understandable intro to the idea of differential
growth.</p>
<p>You can also extend this to surfaces. The major difference is that you
will have to handle a triangular mesh structure of some kind, which is a
little more complicated.</p>
<p>Finally, if you would like to read up on the actual biological
processes, I'd suggest starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis">Morphogenesis</a>.</p>
