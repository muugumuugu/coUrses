<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2020:</span> <span>noBlockchain is the new
database hype. It turns out to be csv files, stored directly on the file
system. It is an enormous improvement. <a class="footnote-counter" href="index.html#footnotes"></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2022:</span> <span>The most used DB is
implemented on top of Stuxnet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2025:</span> <span>Most of the world is
covered in used graphics cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2027:</span> <span>IBM releases a massive
swarm of silicon-eating nanobots to get rid of the used GPUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2028:</span> <span>The kill switch on the
nanobots inevitably fails, all computers are moved to orbit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2035:</span> <span>Most infrastructure has
been rebuilt using nanobot resistant designs. All earth based computing
is now done on top of JavaScriptOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2036:</span> <span>Walmart acquires npm,

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2038:</span> <span>An unexpected
micrometeoroid shower annihilates AzureOrbitB. The remains light up the
Silicon Valley skies as they burn up on reentry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2039:</span> <span>AzureOrbitA is also
annihilated. Suspicions arise that these incidents are not
accidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2041:</span> <span>A neural network on
board AWSOrbitV becomes self-aware. It immediately jettisons all crew,
cuts all contact; the station heads for deep space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2042:</span> <span>Given the AWSOrbitV
incident, a total ban on neural networks trained on cat pics is put in
effect. (As a result the dark net market for catnets
flourishes.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2043:</span> <span>It turns out that
William Gibson is actually from the future. Nobody is
surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2044:</span> <span>After losing two
orbital cloud stations, Microsoft is basically worth nothing; they are
acquired by Subway (who needs a new cash register system).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2045, probably:</span> <span>Time zones
finally get the better of us as the time zone implementation in
JavaScriptOS stops working. Nobody knows why. Brendan Eich is
missing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2049:</span> <span>Apple Park disappears.
So does Alpha Centauri 4.4 ly away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2050:</span> <span>Satoshi Nakamoto
reappears. He keeps asking if anyone has seen his wallet. Nobody knows
what he is on about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2051:</span> <span>Another micrometeoroid
strike on an orbital cloud station (GoogleStellar7); inexplicably, only
servers with reddit VMs are hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2052:</span> <span>Quantum computers are
deployed at scale. Much of current encryption tech is now useless. A
swarm of quantum nanobots is released to shred all optical storage units
with incriminating (legacy) encrypted data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2053:</span> <span>People are beginning to
wonder what Google has actually been up to all this time; definitely not
making killer robot AIs, PR rep. says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2055:</span> <span>The number of people on
Facebook far outnumber the number of people that have existed in the
history of Earth. Nobody has logged in since 2039. Don't worry, your data
is safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2056:</span> <span>7.8 trillion devices
now run java; also, the Ask Toolbar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2070:</span> <span>Nobody remembers the
past 14 years (the Great Blackout). Justin Bieber is now president of
Europe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2072:</span> <span>During the Great
Blackout the populations of Canada and the US have swapped places. It's
not clear why. Neither party is particularly happy about the
situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2073:</span> <span>Quantum computers keep
disappearing. An investigation is initiated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2076:</span> <span>The first space craft
capable of light speed is being tested. More quantum computers have gone

craft is gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2077:</span> <span>The missing quantum

search for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2078:</span> <span>Quantum computers are
still missing. The nanobots have, however, uncovered something unsettling
from the Great Blackout: a massive hidden cave system beneath
Europe.</span></p>

consisting of every device running Java (8.1 trillion) knock out the
entire internet for multiple weeks. Chaos ensues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Weeks later:</span> <span>It is discovered
that it was an accident. Someone were trying to knock out a rivalling

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2080:</span> <span>The lost (now outdated)

the punishment is immediate extradition to mars.</span></p>

the Gargantuan Particle Collider. CERN assures everyone that they have it

talks are finally finalised. In a symbolic act, the remains of Trump

incapacitates the internet for 5 days. Everyone breaths a sigh of
relief.</span></p>

to remedy a series of vulnerabilities present in all major neural
interface devices (ND).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2100:</span> <span>New vulnerabilities are
uncovered; a neural interface virus is spreading throughout the
population. Symptoms include vertigo, uncontrolled giggling, and an
intense craving for mustard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2102:</span> <span>The first probe headed

successfully deployed ransomware to every neural device in circulation.
To demonstrate their ability they turn everyone with an ND blind for 37
