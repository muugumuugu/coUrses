<h1>Stereoscopic filming</h1>
<h3>Achieving an accurate sense of depth and scale</h3>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
Oct 2008
</center>
<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
In the following I discuss, by way of an example, the process of filming
stereoscopically and preparing the resulting material for viewing. Of particular
emphasis for this application was to achieve a true sense of scale and depth
of the filmed material, this requires a certain rigour not normally required
for many applications that require stereoscopic filming. Please note that there
are alternative ways of achieving the same results outlined here, this serves
primarily as documentation of what needs to be achieved and the work-flow employed
by the author on a particular stereoscopic filming project and using the Final
Cut Pro editing software.
</p>

<b>Key geometric considerations</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The key to achieving a correct sense of scale and depth in any stereoscopic content
is to match the viewing geometry with the camera geometry. For content that is world
scale and observed by a human, this means matching the frustums of the recording
cameras to the frustums (one for each eye) of the observer to the 
eventual stereoscopic projection environment. The key parameters are:
the interocular distance of the human viewer, the geometry of the viewer with respect
to the viewing screen (assuming a single flat display here),
and the field of view the viewer sees through the display rectangle.
</p>
<center>
   <img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/viewer.jpg" width=800 height=320 border=0>
</center>
<p align="justify">
Only by careful matching the recording geometry with the viewing geometry can a correct sense
of scale and depth be achieved. Similarly, when viewing any stereoscopic content the
correct or intended depth and scale is only correct when viewed from a single position,
all other positions involve some distortion. As one moves towards or away from the
correct position a depth error occurs (depth is stretched or compressed) and a scale
error occurs mainly arising from field of view changes. As one moves
left-right-up-down from the correct viewing position the error involves a shearing
of space. To illustrate this consider stereo footage captured for an observer at
position 1, if the observer moves to position 2 the depth in the scene will appear
to compress in depth.
</p>
<center>
   <img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/viewer2.jpg" width=800 height=280 border=0>
</center>
<p align="justify">
Note that in realtime generation of stereoscopic pairs the above problem can be
solved with head tracking, ensuring the correct frustums are always created. With
filmed material this luxury does not exist. The distortion effects mentioned above
are easy to verify in a non-head tracked stereoscopic system by moving around and
observing the shearing effects that result.
</p>

<b>Camera rig</b><p>
<p align="justify">
As discussed above ideally the cameras would be separated by human eye separation,
namely 6.5cm (on average for an adult). The cameras are aligned parallel, this is
the correct approach rather than toe-in cameras. Desirable characteristics of the
camera rig include good levelling and the ability to be able to lock the cameras
to a base that moves along a track in such a way that the cameras can be moved
and replaced without destroying alignment (generally best performed in a controlled
environment rather than in the field). The cameras at least need to be slid along the
railing in order to access the display of the right camera for zoom setting
(see later).
</p>
<center>
	<img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/camerarig.jpg" width=800 height=591 border=1>
</center>
<p align="justify">
The video cameras used here are HD resolution, namely 1080p.
Even though the playback system is a 4x3 aspect, 16x9 aspect for filming has
an important advantage, namely it provides plenty of horizontal movement for sliding
the image in order to align zero parallax correctly (see later).
The key requirement for the bar that holds the cameras is that it has a good levelling
bubble, the tripod needs to be relatively stable in order for this levelling to
be persistent across the filming session.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The cameras need to be aligned parallel to each other, one way to do this is
to film a test grid pattern. If the horizontal and vertical lines are parallel
to the image frame in both cameras and parallel to each other then the cameras
are both perpendicular to the wall and parallel to each other.
</p>
<center>
   <img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/alignment.jpg" width=800 height=508 border=1>
</center><p>
<p align="justify">
A last note on cameras ... colour and brightness matching between cameras is
important, in addition it should be noted that cameras can have their sensors
positioned slightly differently with respect to the lens. This can be observed
by noting the vertical offset of the horizontal lines in the above image. 
This matching can best be achieved by finding the best pair of cameras
from a collection of 3 or 4 cameras, assuming you have a friendly
camera shop. Before shooting a manual white balance should be performed with
both cameras. While CCD offsets and small zoom differences can be compensated
for in post production (see below), colour differences are significantly more
time consuming and problematic to fix.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Note also the barrel distortion in the above vertical and horizontal alignment
lines. This is a natural (normal) attribute of a lens, if necessary it can be
corrected for in post production. 
Such correction is quite common if the content is going to be
composited with computer generated material, it won't be considered here.
</p>

<b>Configuring FinalCutPro</b><p>
<p align="justify">
While one may initially create a video capture sequence that matches the camera specifications,
the editing for the final display should be performed at least at the aspect ratio
of the final stereoscopic display system, in this case 4x3. 
The resolution of the final stereo footage
may be chosen higher in order to support higher resolution displays, in this case
it is set to the native resolution of the projectors being employed, namely XGA.
This footage will for ever remain in the progressive digital domain and while
more lossy codecs may be used in the future, for the initial cut an essentially 
lossless compression is chosen (Photo-JPEG). For this project a key-frame (time independent)
codec is also required because the footage needs to be precisely positioned and
paused. The key sequence settings for FinalCutPro are shown below.
</p>

</center><p>

<b>Alignment in time</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The first process is to align the two streams in time, this arises because gen-locking
the cameras usually isn't supported with small commodity video cameras. Given a 25p
capture using the cameras used here, the two streams can be aligned to within half
a frame, namely 1/50 second, this has proven adequate to date. What one looks for
is a sharp event in time, either something that occurs naturally in the content or
by the use of a clapper board at the start of each filming run. In the following case
the fast action of swatting a fly was used as the alignment timing event. Due this time 
alignment some post processing saving can be incurred by filming long continuous
sessions rather than many shorter clips, each of which then requires a separate
time alignment process.
</p>

</center><p>

<b>Alignment of images in the plane</b><p>
<p align="justify">
As discussed above, in order to achieve a correct sense of scale and depth the
camera needs to be placed, in relation to the screen, the same as the
viewers relationship to the screen. This not only locks in the distance
to zero parallax but also
the field of view of the camera, which should match the frustum from the eventual
viewers eyes to the corners of the stereo screen frame.
To facilitate this a frame is built with crossbars that match the height of the
lower and upper edge of the eventual viewing screen. This frame is videoed by itself
for a short period before each stereo filming session. The next stage of the processing
of the two streams is to scale and translate the streams such that the horizontal
crossbars fill the field of view and translate the streams horizontally so that the
bar is at zero parallax. After this process, all pairs of objects should only
exhibit horizontal parallax, that is, no vertical parallax.
</p>

</center><p>

<b>Export of streams and combining them in QuickTime Pro</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The stereoscopic playback system used in this exercise is fairly standard for
polaroid based stereo based upon two projectors and the footage is played back
as standard movies of either double the width or double the height. In the
example here double width movie frames will be created, the left eye image on
the left half of the frame and right eye image on the right half.
</p>
<center>
   <img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/outlay.jpg" width=800 height=260 border=0></a>
</center><p>
<p align="justify">
This has the
advantage of being played back using standard QuickTime Pro on a double width
display created with something like the Matrox dual-head-2-go. Or using software
such as <a href="../../dome/warpplayer/index.html">warpplayer</a> to play across dual displays
formed with a dual head graphics card (note that warpplayer also has improved
performance over QuickTime Pro and has the ability to support a software alignment). 
The choice here is to export the left and right
eye streams individually and combine them into the correct format for playback
as a separate exercise.
</p>
<center>
   <a href="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/fcp4.jpg"><img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/fcp4_s.jpg" width=800 height=546 border=1></a>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
An alternative approach 
is to position the two streams side by side in FCP in a new sequence with twice
the width of each eye stream. However this requires setting up exact crops 
horizontally on each stream. Much simpler is to save each stream separately
and combine them using QuickTime Pro and the "offset" option after coping
and "Add to movie" (Edit menu) of one stream into the other. 
Keeping the two streams separate and saving them
as the master copies generally makes creating formats for alternative projection
solutions in the future easier. For example, in some cases higher performance
playback can be achieved with a top/bottom arrangement of the two streams.

</center><p>

<b>Playback</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The system employed here is a linear polaroid based projection system. In reality
from a content creation perspective it matters little whether it is linear polaroid,
circular polaroid, shutter glasses, or Infitec. If all has worked correctly the view
through the stereo projection window will appear identical to the view through a 
similar rectangle in the real world filming environment. The distance to moderately distant
objects is one depth cue that is easy to judge. Another key depth cue for testing
the success is the ground plane, it should appear consistent with the real floor in
front of the projection screen.

<h1>Small scale stereoscopic photography</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
September 2009
</center>
<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
The following documents an approach to creating stereoscopic photographs and video
of small scale objects, for example, live insects. The trick is achieving the small
camera separation which is proportional to the size of the object being photographed.
In order to take stereoscopic photographs of an object on the scale of a cm, one needs
a camera separation on the order of 1/2mm, or less. While this can be achieved for stationary
objects with a single camera offset at two different times, this approach is not acceptable
for moving objects.
</p>

<center>
   <img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/diagram.jpg" width=800 height=568 border=0>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The solution here is to use a beam splitter to essentially fold the light path for
one camera. The cameras are now at right angles to each other and the
view frustums can be moved
arbitrarily close to each other. A technique is also required to capture the images
at the same time, in this case the LANC interface supported by older Sony cameras
is used. A stereo LANC controller provides synchronised images within 3 or 4 ms.
Unfortunately as of 2009 Sony seems to have discontinued this support in their
current range of digital cameras, the solution would seem to reside with Canon
cameras and the CHDK (Canon-hack development kit).

The images above show the very basic prototype: two cameras, beam splitter at 45 degrees,
lanc controller, cover to ensure the second camera only receives light reflected
from the beam splitter.
</p> 

<b>Notes</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
The beam splitter is 50% symmetric transmission/refection, other ratios
exist and would clearly result in unmatched intensities between the stereo pairs.

<h1>Stereo Pair Photography (the low cost way)</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
July 1999
</center>
<p><br><p>

<b>Introduction</b>
<p align="justify">
Stereo photography involves taking a photograph from two positions,
these correspond to two "eye" positions. The two cameras cannot just be
arbitrarily separated and point in roughly the right direction. The
separation depends on the distance of the closest objects in the scene
and the degree of stereo one wishes to achieve. The cameras should be
angled inwards
<a href="index.html#offaxis">*</a> 
so that imaginary rays projected into the scene intersect
at a depth that is intended to be at the projection plane. Objects that
are closer than this intersection point will appear to be closer to
the viewer, points behind this intersection point will appear to be
further from the viewer. 
There is a limit to how close objects can be made to appear
and still provide comfortable viewing, a general rule of thumb is for
the camera separation to be around 1/20'th of the distance where the 
camera rays intersect.
<p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/camera.gif" width="703" height="211">
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The two photographs are 
presented independently to each eye by any number of techniques. Some
people are able to focus their eyes on a more distant position
and view the two images (stereo
pairs) unassisted. Most people prefer some assistance in the form of a
stereoscope or more recently by stereo computer graphics devices.
Whatever the means, the result is the appearance of depth....the image
appears to be 3 dimensional. The technique was very popular in the
late 1800's and early 1900's where it was embraced by the relatively
new photographic technology. The following stereo pair was taken of the
USS Oregon with a specially design stereo camera in 1898. These images
were originally designed to be viewed with stereoscopes which were 
developed in the early 1800's. The popular Wheatstone and Brewster stereoscopes
used prisms and mirrors to present the left and right images independently
to each eye.

<b>Example 1</b>
<p align="justify">
The following example was captured using a high definition digital camera.
The clock tower is part of the town hall on the corner of Glenferrie and
Burwood roads in Melbourne, Australia. One of the problems of using a single
camera and taking two shots is that any movement in the time between the
shots results in viewing degradation. For example
in the following images, the area around the flag seems confused because 
it had moved between the two images. The two camera approach needs to be
abandoned for the stereo photograph of all but still scenes, even moving
clouds can ruin the effect.

</center>

<p align="justify">
The question of the separation of the camera is not as straightforward
as one might imagine. It depends on the size of the image in relation to
you distance from it, as well as the degree of the 3D effect one might
try to replicate. In practice it is
good form to take a number of shots at various separations and combine
the best pair by experimentation afterwards.
</p>

<b>Example 2</b>

<p align="justify">
The following image is one taken from a movie recorded using two digital
movie cameras. This is much harder than taking single shots, both in terms of
filming and the subsequent processing. The main ingredient is a strong
tripod and mounting bar for the cameras. The mounting needs to allow the
cameras to slide apart from normal eye separation to perhaps 1 meter
separation. It needs to be able to be precisely levelled. The hardest part
is turning the cameras so they focus at the depth of interest, normally
the cameras are mounted on dials with a fine gear arrangement that turns
the cameras together (but in opposite angle directions, one turns
clockwise while the other turns anticlockwise). As with a single camera
it is necessary to have a cross hair arrangement in order to point the
cameras at the same point.

</center>

<p align="justify">
Given that the cameras are aligned properly during recording, if the cameras
are not synchronised as is the case with two independent cameras, then the
two captured video streams need to be aligned in time. For the exercise
discussed here this alignment was done in the stereo viewing software
itself but it could just as easily be done using one of the many commercial
digital video editing packages available. It is assumed that the clocks in
the two cameras are precise enough not to slip in time. The alternative
is to use time locked (gen-locked) digital cameras, this is a much more
expensive option than using independent "consumer grade" cameras.
</p>

<b>Viewing</b>
<p align="justify">
There are many ways of viewing stereo pairs. A popular method in the early
days of computer graphics was to use red/blue glasses and superimpose the
two views into one image after turning the left and right views into the
appropriate colour. So for example if the glasses had blue lens on the left
and red lens on the right, then the left eye image would be shaded blue
and the right eye image shaded red. This images resulting from this general
technique are normally called anaglyphs.
The example below is from the Mars lander which took a large number of
stereo pairs from the surface of Mars.
</p>

<br>Anaglyph</a>
</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p align="justify">
The obvious problem with this method is that only
grey scale images can be viewed. Another approach is to project the image
with say two different polarisations of light and then the user wears
glasses with the appropriate filters. Horizontal and vertically polarised
light is frequently used but it doesn't allow head rotation. A better
technique is to project with right and left circular polarised light.
The projection simply involves two slide or movie projectors with filters
over their lens, it is important though to project onto a screen that
doesn't destroy the polarisation, metal projection screen satisfy this.

<p align="justify">
More sophisticated techniques involve high
refresh monitors that alternatively draw the left and right eye images.
The viewer then wears glasses of some kind that allow the eye to see the
images it is supposed to see. One approach is to use LCD shutters that
alternatively turn from transparent to opaque, the shutter for each eye
is synchronised to the images being displayed on the monitor. This
synchronisation was first done by a cable but is now usually accomplished
with an infra-red emitter allowing greater movement and comfort by the wearer.
With the advent of reasonably low cost shutter glasses this technique is 
becoming popular in games for the home computer market. To be really successful
and to minimise artefacts it is necessary to acquire a monitor with fast
phosphor and LCD shutter with a fast response. Without these there can be
significant ghosting, some of the left eye's image for example is seen by
the right eye. An example of a viewing arrangement is shown below, the red
light on top of the monitor is an infra-red emitter that synchronises the
glasses with the alternating images on the monitor.

concept". It displays two "raw" images in the left and right frame buffers,
the image must be 800 by 600 and the monitor is assumed to be working
in stereo at the same resolution. Other configurations should easily
be able to be supported making small changes to this code.
</p>

<b>Toe-in and off-axis stereo</b>
<p align="justify">
The method of turning in the two cameras is known as "toe-in". It isn't
the ideal method to use since it introduces various distortions, most
noticeably vertical parallax increasing out from the center of the
image. It was discussed here because it doesn't require modifications
to a standard camera or video camera. 
</p>
<center><img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/toe-in.gif" width="532" height="345"></center><p>
<p align="justify">
The better way to photograph
stereo pairs is with what is known as off-axis projections, unfortunately
this requires either special lens/film arrangements or in the case of
CCD cameras the CCD needs to be shifted horizontally on both cameras
(in different directions). When using an off-axis camera the cameras
are mounted parallel.
</p>
<center><img src="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorecord/parallel.gif" width="532" height="345"></center><p>

<p align="justify">
Another option is to photograph a slightly larger view than is intended
with parallel cameras. The off-axis projections are created by aligning
the two images and clipping off the unused bits, this will involve
removing a strip on the left of the left pair and a strip on the right
of the right hand pair. The exact amount to cut off can be determined
by eye by visually inspecting the alignment or calculated by straightforward
geometric considerations. Photoshop is particularly good for visually
aligning the pairs because they can be superimposed with one slightly
transparent, no doubt other image manipulation packages can achieve the
same result.

While most stereo pairs are created with either stereo cameras
or by computer, it is also possible to manually edit a normal
photograph and introduce stereographic 3D effects. The basic
requirement is the ability to selectively (generally using computer
based image editing software) choose objects that should appear in
the foreground or background. These objects are displaced horizontally
on each stereo pair image, the amount and direction of the displacement
dictates the depth and whether it is in front of the image plane or
behind the image plane.

The technique used here will be discussed with an example, the 
original image is shown on the top-right hand side. The idea isn't
difficult but can be tedious and for more complicated images can
require a sound methodology and careful planning.

The first processing in this example was to remove the noisy
appearance between the galaxies and stars. The plan is to keep
the two galaxies in the plane of the image (0 parallax), the
white stars will be brought towards the viewer (negative parallax)
and the smaller reddish stars and galaxies will be moved into
the distance (positive parallax). If the noise in the plane of
the galaxies isn't removed it will form a strong appearance of
a plane.

The different objects are marked (on a separate painting layer)
with different colours depending
on their intended depth. This method was chosen simply because it
is easy to then select the regions by colour using the tools in the
particular image editing software being used (PhotoShop). The red
objects will be brought closest to the viewer, green further away
but still in front of the image plane, blue and yellow are progressively
further away. The more depth variation used the better the end result
but it greatly increases the time consuming nature of the process.

At this stage two images are created, one for each eye. The appropriate
pieces are copied/pasted onto different layers within these two images.
The layers are then shifted left and right as appropriate. For example
the red objects are shifted to the right in the left eye image and to the
left in the right eye image (negative parallax). The yellow objects are
shifted left in the left image and right in the right image.

The amount
of separation requires some experience. Objects that are to be at infinity
are separated by the intended eye separation, objects brought towards
the user shouldn't be separated by more than this eye separation. The
amount of separation is also dependent on the way the stereo pairs are
presented to the viewer, some systems can sustain more separation than
others. It is possible to leave one eye image as it is and just
shift the layers in the other image by twice the amount, the only
issue with this is it increases the chance of problems at the left
and right edge where there isn't enough information or where an object
on one stereo pair disappears off the the side during the shift.
