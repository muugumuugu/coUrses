<b>Perceptual conflicts</b><p>


<p align="justify">
In 1970, a RAAF UH-1 Iroquois was on the ground with rotors turning when another 
Iroqouis taxied alongside it to refuel.  The three aircrew in the second helicopter 
visually confirmed main rotors separation of about 1 metre.  As the second Iroquois 
settled, the rotor clearance proved to be negative by about 1 metre instead and the 
rotors intermeshed destructively.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Also in 1970, the Standards Association of Australia began work on a world-first 
national standard for sunglasses.  One of the safety issues driving the issue of a 
standard was that inequality in the light transmittance of the lenses of a pair of 
sunglasses could produce an illusory displacement of any object moving across the 
field of view (Clark 1968).  The original form of this illusion was discovered by 
Pulfrich in 1922 and is a consequence of a relative visual latency differential in seeing 
by the eye receiving the reduced amount of light.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Illusory alteration of apparent distance and angular speed of objects viewed through 
the side window of a moving vehicle can be obtained by observing with a filter in 
front of one or other eye.  This effect can be seen from aircraft, road vehicles and 
boats, especially at night through night vision goggles (NVGs) with one or other side 
filtered to produce a gain imbalance exceeding the 10% (approx.) tolerance adopted in 
the major national standards for sunglasses.  Gain imbalance has been mentioned 
several times by aviators as a factor in NVGs flight incidents (Crowley, Rash and 
Stephens 1992). 
</p>

<p align="justify">
If an aircrew person's right eye is slightly faster than the left eye in seeing (an 
anisopia effect), an ownship Iroquois rotor seen from near its axis with the blades 
moving from right to left could be expected to appear smaller in radius than a 
stationary blade.  The rotor disk on the adjacent Iroquois would likewise appear to be 
foreshortened by more than the amount caused by the oblique view.  If the Pulfrich 
illusion does apply with fast moving blades, a 1-m perceptual error in the clearance 
between rotors would be caused by an interocular differential of only a few 
milliseconds.
</p>

<p align="justify">
An experimental apparatus was built to test this possibility.  It had a two-bladed rotor, 
about half-scale for an Iroquois.  A variable speed electric motor drive was provided, 
with maximum rotor rotational speed being about half that of a typical helicopter.  
The rotor disk appeared above the observer, as with a real helicopter.  The disk was 
seen against an illuminated featureless background.  The Pulfrich effect was observed: 
reversing either the filter position from one eye to the other or reversing the direction 
of blade rotation made the rotor disk look either larger or smaller.  However, these 
effects took place simultaneously with a previously unknown illusion in which the 
rotor consistently looked either smaller or larger to individuals, the effect increasing 
with rotor speed but apparently independent of rotor direction.  This new illusion was 
also visible through sunglasses and NVGs.
</p>

<p align="justify">
These illusory effects are in conflict with the monocular cues to distance.  At night, 
the monocular cues are weakened and the illusions can become stronger.
</p>


<b>Binocular illusions</b><p>


<p align="justify">
The Pulfrich Effect is a binocular illusion.  It takes the form of a distortion of the 
apparent path of a pendulum swinging in a fronto-parallel plane when the observer 
has a natural (anisopia) or induced imbalance between the illuminance and/or 
sensitivities of the retinas of the two eyes, as with a neutral density filter in front of 
one eye.  The pendulum appears to follow a path that is near elliptical in plan.  The 
direction of motion, clockwise or anticlockwise, depends on which eye has the slower 
response.  The effect is generally accepted to be a result of a differential delay in 
transmission time of information from retina to brain, arising because the signal 
transmission time increases monotonically with reducing retinal illuminance.  In the 
case of objects with a component of apparent motion across the retinas, the brain 
interprets the between-eyes image differences as stereoscopic disparities, leading to 
perceptual conflicts between the monocular and binocular cues to distance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Pulfrich Effect is readily demonstrable through binocular optical instruments, 
including NVGs, by using a neutral density filter either in front of one objective or 
between one eye and the eye lens.  The existence of perceptual conflicts between 
monocular, biocular and binocular views through NVGs with poor matching of light 
gains between barrels may justify reappraisal of helo-NVGs accident cases of 
collision with obstacles (also in Crowley, Rash and Stephens 1992). 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The 'linear Pulfrich Effect' is observed by looking sideways, with a filter covering 
one eye, out of a moving vehicle.  With the filter over the leading eye, the ground 
plane appears lower, objects more distant along the line of sight and apparently faster 
than actual.  Reversing the filter position or motion raises the apparent ground plane 
along the line of sight and makes objects appear closer and slower.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The rationale for sunglasses lens matching tolerance: (0.06 in density, Clark 1968) is 
considered applicable as a first step in controlling the problem, so that the output 
luminance match between the two channels of any biocular or binocular display 
system should be +-13% as a go/nogo limit, pending fuller investigation.

This extract is about a formula derived from observations of perceptual delays 
in one subject using a neutral density filter in front of one eye.  Data pooled 
from several subjects should be sought from the more recent literature if 
greater reliability in prediction of effects is desired.  The example given shows 
how the formula can be applied to calculate the difference in perceptual 
latency when observing with two eyes through cosmetic tinted lenses or 
similar when the two lenses have differing transmittances.  The horizon sky 
passes through a luminance of 1.0 cd/m<sup>2</sup> during twilight.

In the so-called Hess effect<sup><a href="index.html#1">1</a></sup> 
and the Pulfrich (1922) effect<sup><a href="index.html#2">2</a></sup>, the perceptual 
latency of seeing t increases monotonically as the retinal illuminance 
decreases (Guth, 1964): no cone-rod discontinuity is apparent.  For a subject 
of Rogers and Anstis (1972), with luminance L instead of troland value 
(Wyszecki and Stiles, 1967),

log t (ms) = 1.653 - 0.184 log L (cd/m<sup>2</sup>)

<p align="justify">
The perceptual latency at 1.0 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, as viewed through a filter with T = 88% is 
46.0 ms and, with T = 66%, 48.5 ms.  The latency differential is thus 2.5 ms.  
At 0.01 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, as in rural night driving, the differential is 4.1 ms.

An illusory phase displacement is observed monocularly when images of
different luminance's are oscillated together.  The dimmer image lags because
of perceptual latency.  Williams and Lit (1983) called this the Hess effect even
though they cited earlier studies by Szili and Charpentier.

Pulfrich effect: an illusory near-elliptical motion of a pendulum bob swinging
in a fronto-parallel plane and observed binocularly with one eye covered by a
filter.  The longer latency in the visual pathway from the dimmer retinal image
is largely responsible (Lit, 1949; Wilson and Anstis, 1969; Spafford and
Cotnam, 1989; Emerson and Pesta, 1992).  The effect can produce illusory
localisations of traffic and roadside objects (eg Allen, 1961; Clark, 1969;
Enright, 1970; Landrigan, 1984).

Clark to the enquiry into the mid-air collision of two Australian Army 
Blackhawk helicopters, 1996</h3>

<p align="justify">
Illusory alteration of apparent distance and angular speed of terrain objects viewed 
through the side window of a moving vehicle can be obtained by observing with a 
filter in front of one or other eye.  This effect, analogous to the Enright effect, has 
been seen by numerous others in company with the writer on many occasions from 
aircraft, road vehicles and boats, for relative azimuths determined to be within the 
ranges of between about 1 to 5 o'clock and 7 to 11 o'clock.  Objects such as other 
vehicles with their own motion appear to be displaced in depth regardless of relative 
azimuth, provided that that they have an appreciable component of relative motion 
across the field of regard, ie transverse motion.
