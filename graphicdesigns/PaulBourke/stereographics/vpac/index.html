<h1>A portable rear projection stereoscopic display</h1>

<b>Introduction</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The following describes a reasonably portable
stereoscopic 3D projection device built from a grant provided
by VPAC (Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing)
in 2002. The basic concept was derived from a front projection
stereoscopic theatre in existence at the Swinburne University
Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing.
During the construction and refinement stage the
system was used in demonstrations to a wide variety of
potential users, was employed in scientific visualisation
exercises by VPAC and university researchers, formed part 
of scientific presentations by
Swinburne staff, and was experienced by the public at a 
number of events including those running at the Melbourne
Museum.

These pages serve as a manual for future users. It
discusses how to correctly create stereo pairs for any
stereoscopic projection system and gives examples for two
specific computer graphics environments, namely OpenGL and PovRay.
In the case of OpenGL the shell of a C program is presented
that creates the correct projection for stereo pairs, this code
is designed not as a final application but as a way of 
illustrating the key requirements. The PovRay examples
consist of how to create the correct camera set-up, the
approach used here can usually be applied to any rendering
package that supports a standard perspective projection.
