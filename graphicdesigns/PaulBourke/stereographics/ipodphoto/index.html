<h1>The IPOD-Photo Stereoscope</h1>
<h3>The smallest digital stereoscopic projection system?</h3>

In the early days of photography, stereoscopic viewing was all the rage, it is
estimated that over half the households in the UK and US owned a stereoscope.
Photographers travelled the world taking stereoscopic photographs for a
population who were unable to travel widely themselves. Fast forward 100
years and with the help of what is now an antique stereoscope, a digital 
camera, and a device such as an IPOD-Photo, one can once again view 
colour stereo-pair images without <a href="../stereoinstall/index.html">
specialised computer hardware</a>.

For those wondering what "stereoscopic" is all about, 
viewing stereoscopic images gives
an enhanced depth perception. This is similar to the depth perception we 
get in real life, the same effect IMAX 3D and many computer games now provide. 
Stereoscopic viewing of any sort involves independent
presentation of a different image, called a stereo-pair, to each eye. These
<a href="../stereorecord/index.html">stereo-pairs</a> 
are essentially two different views of the world corresponding
to the slightly different views our eyes see because they are separated
horizontally. There are many ways of achieving the independent presentation
of the stereo-pairs: <a href="../anaglyph/index.html">red/blue glasses</a> 
is one but it doesn't represent colour 
well; electronic shutter glasses are commonly used by computer games and
some IMAX 3D theatres; another popular method employs 
<a href="../passive/index.html">polaroid based glasses</a>, 
these are often used in theme parks and by the 
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereoinstall/mac2.jpg">author</a>.

The first stereoscopes called the Wheatstone's stereoscope was developed around 1833
by British inventor Sir Charles Wheatstone. 
These first stereoscopes pre-date photography and the stereo-pairs in those
days were created as hand drawings, similar to today where we create
synthetic stereo pairs using <a hrefr="../../miscellaneous/raystereo/">computer graphics</a>.
The first stereoscope with a lens is
attributed to David Brewster around 1849 and used paper prints contained within a box.
The stereoscope shown here was developed around 1868 by Oliver Wendell Holmes 
and Joseph Bates, it force the eyes to only see the image they are supposed to see by
using a lens and placing a physical barrier between the images.

For those who don't know anything about an IPOD-Photo. It is a pocket size
device that comes with either a 40GB or 60GB drive, wonderful for carrying around
large file collections. When connected to a computer by USB or FireWire
it appears as an additional
hard disk. The main use is perhaps as a portable music playback device, it has
internal software to manage a music library and a standard stereo output for
headphones or an amplifier. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The feature used in this discussion is its colour display and photo/image 
ability. Images can be downloaded to the IPOD-Photo, the images can subsequently
be recalled and presented on the colour display. A series of images can also be
presented manually or as a self running slide show with some user selected
delay between each image. So to use this as a stereoscopic storage and presentation
device one simply labels two IPOD-Photos as "left" and "right", the images
corresponding to each eye are installed on the appropriate IPOD-Photo.
</p>

<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
The IPOD-Photo has an s-video output,
this allows a much higher quality result by connecting the two IPODs to a 
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereoinstall/mac1.jpg">dual projector stereoscopic projection system</a>.
The same applies to a HMD (Head Mounted Display) which is the modern equivalent
of the stereoscope.

<li><p align="justify">
It would be nice if the IPOD-Photo had a movie player, preferably
based upon QuickTime. Along with an IR remote control to allow
simultaneous playing, two IPOD Photos would be a minimal stereomovie 
playback device.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The IPOD-Photo can play an audio (eg: music/commentary) while it is
playing the slideshow thus creating a richer multimedia experience.
Unfortunately the audio track is independent of the slides, much better
would be if each slide activated a different entry in the playlist.
