<p align="justify">
Gigapixel photography is achieved by taking multiple photographs of a scene, normally
arranged in a grid, and stitching them together to form a large composite image. This
arises from the observation that camera sensor sizes and lens optics are no longer increasing
at a fast rate. In most cases the camera and lens are mounted on a motorised rig, the
top left and bottom right of the desired image along with the field of view of the lens
are programmed into the unit and the subsequent image capture is entirely automated.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The following examples are captured with a Canon 5D MkII and the Sigma 500mm lens.
The main issues in this sort of photography is the depth of field of the lens, at least
in bright sun light a narrow aperture can be used.
The first image is a single row while the second example is four rows.

The originals obviously can't be shown here, at least at this stage the average web
browser is not able to display such high resolution images. 
Indeed even many commercial packages are unable to display images above 32000 pixels, and
even most image file formats are unable to support images with more than 32000 pixels on
a side.

An application of gigapixel photography is archaeology, capturing a detailed photographic
record of a site that may be hard to access or have limited access due to heritage 
and preservation considerations. The following examples are from a Aboriginal rock art
site recording exercise. These are captured with a modest 105mm zoom lens, so the resolution
is only 300 and 500 MPixels respectively.
