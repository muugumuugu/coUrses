<b>1 Introduction</b><p>

<p align="justify">
They say that a picture is worth a thousands words: but what 
about an interactive virtual model of the Universe? 
Visualisation provides a host of new ways to learn about our 
Universe.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As our understanding of the Universe grows, our ideas of what it 
actually looks like begin to take shape. Unfortunately we can 
not yet hop in the "Starship Enterprise" and visit Mars or 
another star system: at the moment we are restricted mainly to 
exploring the Universe from Earth with telescopes. To compensate 
for this, we take the journey into the world of computer 
simulation and Virtual Reality to simulate the space experience.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Over the last eighteen months, the Swinburne Centre for 
Astrophysics and Supercomputing has visualised astronomical 
phenomena for a range of audiences at numerous forums: including 
the Swinburne  Virtual Reality Theatre, Swinburne Astronomy 
Online courses and the Melbourne Planetarium at Scienceworks. 
The aims of the endeavour were manifold; ranging from enhancing 
the Centre's core research activities, to providing unique 
opportunities for public education on space and astronomy in 
Australia. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The computer visualisations are produced using a combination of 
commercial animation packages (primarily Softimage and  
Lightwave) and custom-written C/C++ applications incorporating 
the open source graphics library OpenGL[4].  
</p>

<p align="justify">
We classify visualisations into two broad categories: 
interactive and photorealistic. OpenGL provides geometric 
primitives (points, line and polygons) and various other 
techniques (such as "texture mapping" and lighting) to produce 
worlds that can be explored interactively. The commercial 
animation packages add a more realistic touch, but at the cost 
of interactivity.
</p>

<b>2 Visualisation in Context</b><p>

<p align="justify">
In order to gain an appreciation for some of the problems and 
benefits associated with visualising the Universe, we will 
consider two projects that the Centre has been involved in 
recently.
</p>

<b>2.1 "A Flight Through the Universe"</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The work of an international collaboration, the 2dF Galaxy 
Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is the largest of its kind to date: 
with the goal of measuring the three-dimensional positions of a 
quarter of a million galaxies [1]. The purpose of this ongoing 
survey is to further our understanding of the large scale 
structure and evolution of the Universe, the mass of the 
universe; and provide limits on the fundamental cosmological 
parameters.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
The computer animation project "A Flight Through the Universe" 
(see <a href="index.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>) was commissioned by the Anglo-Australian 
Observatory (AAO) in order to publicise a key milestone in the 
2dFGRS, the 100,000th galaxy position.
</p>

</center>

<p align="justify">
The AAO desired a realistic fly-through of their 2dFGRS dataset 
with which to promote this milestone at the American 
Astronomical Society AGM in July 2000. With the 2dF dataset, the 
Centre was able to produce the most scientifically accurate fly-
through of our known Universe ever constructed out to distances 
of 4 billion light years, equating to a volume of space of about 
13 billion billion cubic light years.
</p>

<b>2.2 Just Add Water: "Terraforming Mars"</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Motivated by the recent excitement over evidence for recent 
groundwater on Mars [2], in a project undertaken by Paul Bourke, 
a more "human friendly" Martian surface was reconstructed. The 
data for the reconstruction of Mars was provided by NASA from 
their Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), one of the key 
instruments of the Mars Global Surveyor [3].  
</p>

<p align="justify">
The NASA dataset was converted to a simple polygon mesh, from 
which a wire-frame Martian surface was reconstructed (see 
<a href="index.html#figure2">Figure 2</a>). 
By adding appropriate colour maps, light source and 
atmospheric effects,  Mars was made habitable!

</center>

<p align="justify">
The ability to create these fictitious extrapolations is one of 
the exciting things that can be achieved with computer models 
and computational power.  Parameters can be changed and modified 
as we see fit, allowing us to imagine what could have been or 
what could be.  We will return to this in more detail later.
</p>

<b>3 Probing the Case Studies</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Many challenges have been encountered whilst trying to visualise 
our Universe.   In this section, we discuss briefly some of 
these challenges, but also some of the unique opportunities that 
the tools of visualisation provide.
</p>

<b>3.1  No Wonder its Called Space... </b><p>

<p align="justify">
Space.  To many people it is one of the most interesting and awe 
inspiring places ever contemplated,  but the reality is quite 
different. In fact, it is called space because there is a lot of 
just that - space! One of the most difficult aspects of 
visualising the Universe is the problem of all this empty space.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This problem was evident in preparing "A Flight Through the 
Universe".  The distance between individual galaxies is 
typically about 100 times (or more) larger than the size of an 
individual galaxy.  Therefore, flying through a completely 
realistic simulation of the large-scale structure of the 
Universe would be a seemingly eternal journey through a 
collection of "dots". 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Although such a model would be more accurate, it would not quite 
have the visual impact that was required for the project. 
Consequently the size of individual galaxies was exaggerated by 
two orders of magnitude to enhance the aesthetics, which had the 
added benefit of making some subtle aspects of large-scale 
structure (such as the existence of groups and clusters of 
galaxies) more obvious.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It is interesting to note that the ratio of size of individual 
stars to their average separation within our Galaxy is many 
orders of magnitude greater than the ratio for individual 
galaxies within the Universe. A realistic flight through our 
Galaxy would make a journey through a "dot" Universe look 
positively exciting!
</p>

<b>3.2  All it Takes is Time</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Strongly related to the dilemma of distance is the  problem of 
time. In the real Universe, there is a very definite maximum 
speed we can travel: the speed of light (300,000 km/sec). A 
simple space probe flight through our Solar System is a serious 
endeavour, taking months to reach the nearest planets.  We are 
still a long way, technologically, from sending missions to the 
stars on a "useful" time scale (for example, the Voyager probes 
will take tens of thousands of years to reach the nearest 
stars).   
</p>

<p align="justify">
Once we step beyond our own Galaxy, the problem clearly gets 
much worse.  Even if we had the technology to do it, to "simply" 
travel across a supercluster (a cluster is gravitationally bound 
collection of many hundreds of galaxies; a supercluster is a 
cluster of galaxy clusters) at the speed of light would take in 
order of the Hubble Age of the Universe ( ~ 12 billion years). 
</p>

<p align="justify">
For "A Flight Through the Universe", we again had to trade-off 
the physically accurate for the visually interesting. 
Interpreting the simulation time as "real time" we travelled at 
velocities 1015 times the speed of light, which is quite 
impossible.  Even with the most  fanciful explanations, such as 
we are viewing a set of "time lapse" images, this journey could 
only have been undertaken in a virtual world.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Further to this we must also appreciate that our everyday 
experiences are limited to relatively slow velocities.  The 
velocities required to explore our Galaxy would actually change 
the way we perceive the Universe as relativistic effects begin 
to dominate (see Savage and Searle work [7] for a description of 
visualising relativistic effects). To realistically travel 
through our Universe we would be fighting relativity at every 
bend.
</p>

<b>3.3  But What Does it Really Look Like?</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Another fundamental problem in the visualisation of the Universe 
is our limited knowledge of what many astronomical objects look 
like at optical wavelengths. We gain an understanding about the 
physics of an object from all different wavelengths of the 
electromagnetic spectrum such as: radio, gamma and x-ray, 
however, for our visualisations we are mainly concerned with 
what we can see, that is the optical regime. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Although we can present images of most of our Solar System quite 
well, our best high resolution optical images (e.g. Hubble Space 
Telescope) of Pluto and Charon are still quite inadequate. With 
obvious limitations on the resolution of our optical telescopes 
we are quite unaware of what many particular astronomical 
phenomena look like. This presents us with particularly fun 
problems as we  infer and imagine from the physics what the 
astronomical objects could conceivably look like. One class of  
objects the Centre is particularly interested in is pulsars. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star, that is, a star 
made almost entirely of neutrons, that was formed after a very 
massive star ended its life as a supernova. Pulsars are 
surrounded by very strong dipolar magnetic fields which guides 
two highly focused beams of radiation from the poles of the 
star. As these beams sweep across the Earth's position (like a 
cosmic lighthouse), regular radio pulses are detected.  No one 
has ever received a "close-up" view of a pulsar, but from our 
understanding of the physics involved, we can reconstruct a 
plausible model (see <a href="index.html#figure3">Figure 3</a>).

<p>

<b>3.4  Looking on the Bright Side</b><p>

<p align="justify">
As mentioned earlier, one of the unique things we can do with 
computer models is to expand our ideas, to imagine other 
alterations and to show detail where we could not see it before. 
Exaggerating the perturbations in Mars's surface provided  quite 
striking results showing quite clearly the diversity on the 
Martian surface, helping us better understand the topology of 
Mars.

<b>4 Visualisation in Action</b><p>

<p align="justify">
There have been many opportunities for the Centre to present the 
Universe to the Australian public and to the world.
</p>

<b>4.1 Astronomy Online</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The Centre's Astronomy online course is an  Internet based 
astronomy course that reaches students from around the world. An 
increasing number of astronomical visualisation have been placed 
into the course.
</p>

<b>4.2 Let's Get Virtual: AstroTour</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Virtual Reality (VR) has been around since 1968 with the 
implementation of the first system by Ivan Sutherland [5].  
However, it wasn't until the 1980s that VR captured the 
imagination of the popular press. Unfortunately, with the 
expense attached to many VR devices, slow progress has been made 
with applications of VR. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are many different types of VR.  For our purpose, however, 
it is defined to be a self contained 3D world which the user can 
move around in and interact with.  The emphasis of the Centre's 
VR work has been on stereoscopic 3D, which simulates the human 
experience. In the 3D world, two computer "cameras" are used to 
simulate our eyes, so that two separate views of each scene are 
calculated.  With the aid of a pair of shutter glasses, these 
images are viewed as left-eye image with left-eye only and 
right-eye image by the right-eye only. This provides a sensation 
of depth and results in a more realistic VR experience.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Centre's director, Professor Matthew Bailes, was attracted 
to VR by the potential to visualise scientific datasets in an 
attempt to further understand the underlying physics. With this 
objective in mind the Swinburne group developed an affordable VR 
alternative, with the creation of the Virtual Reality theatre 
during 1999. Since then, the benefits of the VR theatre have 
been significant.  Most notably, it provides a novel and 
exciting method with which we can feed the appetites of space-
hungry Australians and communicate the wonders of the Cosmos.
</p>

<p align="justify">
We are excited at Swinburne to see the launch of our Astro tours 
for school children as we seek to excite them to the 
possibilities of space as they are taken on a journey through a 
Virtual 3D Universe. (For more information on the Astro tours 
refer to reference [6])
</p>

<b>5   Conclusions</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Visualisation of the Universe is no small task. It involves a 
great deal of physics and computational power mixed together 
with a healthy imagination.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Some of the fundamental problems that plague visualisation also 
plague space travel. The Universe is a large place and the laws 
of physics just make it that bit larger. A virtual Universe 
allows us to make the Universe as small as we like because we 
are able to bend the rules.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Centre's visualisations and Virtual Reality theatre provide 
a place to dream, and to generate excitement and desire in 
people to imagine "what if?". It is truly a powerful medium with 
which to educate but also to cast a vision and spark the next 
generation of explorers. For many people though, flying through 
a virtual Universe is not enough, but it is an exciting 
beginning.

<p align="justify">
Every visualisation the Centre undertakes seeks to represent the 
Universe as faithfully as possible, consequently we depend 
fundamentally of scientific data. Therefore, we would like to 
extend our thanks to Brian Boyle and David Malin from the AAO, 
Matthew Colless and the rest of the 2dFGRS team and NASA.
