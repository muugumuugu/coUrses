<h1>Uniform random number generator</h1>
Compiled and "slightly" modified by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
Original: December 1990<br>
Updated: March 1998<br>

<p>
The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.

The library is made up of two files<br>

<b>The following is the original description of the algorithm for
the uniform random number generator.<br>For
more details see the source code.</b>
<p>
   This Random Number Generator is based on the algorithm in a FORTRAN
   version published by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman, Florida State
   University.
<p>
   At the fhw (Fachhochschule Wiesbaden, W.Germany), Dept. of Computer
   Science, we have written sources in further languages (C, Modula-2
   Turbo-Pascal(3.0, 5.0), Basic and Ada) to get exactly the same test
   results compared with the original FORTRAN version.
<p>
   This random number generator originally appeared in "Toward a Universal
   Random Number Generator" by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman.
   Florida State University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987)
   It was later modified by F. James and published in "A Review of Pseudo-
   random Number Generators"
<p><center>
   THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AVAILABLE.
<p></center>
   It passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period
   of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all
   machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point
   representation).
<p>
   The algorithm is a combination of a Fibonacci sequence (with lags of 97
   and 33, and operation "subtraction plus one, modulo one") and an
   "arithmetic sequence" (using subtraction).

<b>The following is the header and credits for the Gaussian distributed
random samples.<br>For more details see the source code.</b><p>

  ALGORITHM 712, COLLECTED ALGORITHMS FROM ACM.<br>
  THIS WORK PUBLISHED IN TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE,<br>
  VOL. 18, NO. 4, DECEMBER, 1992, PP. 434-435.
<p>
  The function returns a normally distributed pseudo-random
  number with zero mean and unit variance.  Calls are made to a
  function sub-program which must return independent random
  numbers uniform in the interval (0,1).
<p>
  The algorithm uses the ratio of uniforms method of A.J. Kinderman
  and J.F. Monahan augmented with quadratic bounding curves.
