<h1>DFT / FFT Software for the Macintosh</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>

<b>Introduction</b><br>
<p align="justify">
DFT_FFT is a Macintosh utility that reads either real or complex 
series and computes either the DFT or FFT. It is designed as a data
exploratory/investigation tool rather than a total analysis package. 
</p>

<table width=100%><tr><td valign='top">
<b>Input file format</b><br>
<p align="justify">
The series to be studied should be created in a plain text file, for
a solely real series this would be a list of numbers separated by
white space (spaces, tabs, returns, etc). For a complex series it should
be a list of number pairs, real and imaginary parts. 
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/fftsoftware/test.data">This file</a> serves as a simple example of a complex
series of 1024 points, this data will be used for the examples shown here.
The choice of real or complex data is made when one chooses "Open" from
the "File" menu.

<table width=100%><tr><td valign='top">
<b>Saving</b><p>
<p align="justify">
At any stage the current series can be saved to a text file in one of
the following formats, chosen from the "Save" in the "File" menu.
In all cases the file will contain two columns, the interpretation
of the index is left up to the operator.

</td></tr></table><p>

<b>Graphing</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The time series is displayed as follows, note that in this example
the file contained two columns and was opened as real/imaginary even
though the imaginary term is 0. Note also that no assumptions are
made as to the meaning of the index, it could be a time series, frequency,
spatial, etc.

<table width=100%><tr><td valign='top">
There are two options for transforming the series, the DFT or FFT

By default the real and imaginary data will be plotted, various other
graphs can be chosen from the "Graph Options" in the "Analysis" menu.
The graphing are minimal, for more professional and publication graphs
the operator is expected to save the data and create graphs using
their favorite graphing package.

For example the magnitude/phase graph is shown below. The form of this
shouldn't be a surprise since the input series above looks like a 
sinusoid plus noise, there aren't an integer number of cycles in the
series so there is spectral leakage. The first N/2 samples are the
positive frequencies from DC to Nyquist, the second N/2-1 samples are
the negative frequencies.

At any time information on the series in either domain can be obtained
from the "Get Info" in the "Analysis" menu.
