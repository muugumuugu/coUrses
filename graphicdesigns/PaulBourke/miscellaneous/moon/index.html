<h1>Moon Topology based upon the Clementine data</h1>

<p align="justify">
In 1994 the Clementine mission to the moon was launched. The mission
gathered a large collection of high resolution images but also
collected topology data using laser ranging altimetry (LIDAR).
The mapping started near the end of February 1994 and lasted about
two months, one month per hemisphere.
The following image is a reduced version of the topology data,
the lighter the region the higher the topology.

<p align="justify">
Unfortunately, while the resolution of this topology data is
adequate for distant images it isn't nearly high enough for
close encounters. The elevation samples are at approximately
1/4 x 1/4 degree steps, each sample is an offset to a sphere
of 1738km (flattening of 1/3234.93), in other words at the
equator the grid is about 7.5km. It is my "guess" that even
those samples are not particularly independent of neighbours
further reducing the real resolution.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Another limitation of the data is that it only ranges from
60 North to 60 South latitude so there is no data to within 30 degrees
of either pole.
