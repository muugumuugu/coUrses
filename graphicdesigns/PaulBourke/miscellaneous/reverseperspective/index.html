By way of introduction, consider the model of a virtual camera in computer graphics
and a 3D object, a cube say. The two key parameters that determine the size of the
object on the projection plane of the camera is the position of the camera with
respect to the object and the field of view of the camera. Both of these can be
adjusted so as to control how large the object appears on the project plane, a
bounded region of this plane being the resulting image. 
The closer the camera is to the object the larger the field of view needs to be
in order for the object to fill the image plane. If the camera is a long way from
the object then a smaller field of view is required in order to fill the image
plane with the object.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Imagine then, starting with the camera close to the object with a large field of view.
In this position the effects of perspective, the degree to which distant parts of the
object appear smaller than the closer parts will be the most pronounced. As the camera is 
moved away and field of view reduced in order to keep the object at the
same size in the frame, the effects of perspective reduce. At the limit with the
camera at infinity, the field of view can be imagined to be zero, there are no
perspective effects and we say the projection is orthographic or parallel.

<p align="justify">
Can this process somehow be continued so that perspective effects are reversed,
that is, parts of the object closest to the camera appear smaller than those parts
of the object further away from the camera? The answer is yes, it is called reverse
or inverted perspective and is the topic of this discussion.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In what follows various examples will be presented. In each case the objects are rendered
three times, as a standard perspective (P > 0), orthographic (P = 0) and finally
reverse perspective (P < 0). The first three show the cube above with a 1, 2 and 3
point perspective.

<br>Three point<p>

</center><br><p>

<p align="justify">
Another way to think about this is to consider the degree to which parts of an object
are scaled as a function of their distance from the camera. In the following imagine the
camera on the negative z axis looking towards the origin. The relative scaling between
the closest part of the object and the furthest part of the object is shown for the
three projections considered here. Note that instead of the closest and furthest
parts of the objects one might also use the near and far cutting plane of the view
frustum. Note this is a clue for a OpenGL/DirectX implementation using a vertex shader.

For those familiar with the construction of perspective in traditional drawing or
architecture, reverse perspective is constructed by placing the object/scene between
the projective point and the viewing/drawing plane. Compared to traditional linear
perspective construction where the projective point is on the opposite side of
the viewing plane to the object or scene.

The following gives an idea of what happens to heads, as the reverse perspective
factor increases one sees more and more of the parts of the head normally obscured.
This is characteristic of many of the heads from reverse perspective in
Byzantine paintings.

</center><br><p>

<p align="justify">
There are many examples of reverse perspective in historical art. However they are not
necessarily constructed in the sense used here, namely that lines of projection diverge
with distance so that more distant objects appear larger. For example, in some cases
the larger distant objects are due to an anamorphic projection so that size appears
correct if one is standing in the "correct" position, the so called reverse perspective
only occurs for other viewing positions. Another set of apparent reverse perspectives
can be attributed to distant figures being larger due to their increased importance.

<p align="justify">
A couple of often quoted examples of reverse perspective are illustrated above, but
there is some debate as to whether that was the intent or whether what looks like reverse
perspective just arose due to a lack of consideration of current perspective combined
with compositional objectives.
While some examples of lines vanishing on the same side of the viewer are drawn, there
are other aspects that are not consistent with reverse perspective.

With regard to Russian and Byzantine religious iconography, Pavel Florensky writes.
 </p>
<center><table width=700><tr><td>
<p align="justify">
"It always transpires that the icons that are the most creative in terms of immediate artistic perception are perspectivally 'defective', whereas icons that better satisfy the perspective textbook are boring and soulless. If you allow yourself simply to forget the formal demands of perspectival rendering for a while, then direct artistic feeling will lead everyone to admit the
superiority of icons that transgress the laws of perspective."
