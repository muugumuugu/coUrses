<h3>Fundamental parallax error when blending images from multiple cameras</h3>

<p align="justify">
The acquisition of multiple photographs which are then stitched/blended together
to form a composite image is a well known technique. The most common applications are
panoramic photography and image mosaic/tiling. Whether standard lenses or fisheye
lenses, those who work in this area take some care in 
aligning the poorly named
"nodal" point of the camera/lens system, essentially combining multiple camera
frustums into a single wider angle view frustum.
Otherwise, for two or more cameras located at different physical locations a perfect
stitch/blend in fundamentally impossible, this is not for want of trying, it simply cannot
be achieved perfectly. The following diagram is intended to illustrate why this is
so, why one can stitch/blend at any one depth but not all depths at once.

<h3>Calculating zero parallax position of a lens/camera system</h3>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>

<p align="justify">
For many applications of multiple image photography it is important to know the zero
parallax distance (sometimes called the "nodal point" but that is not strictly the right
term) of the lens/camera system. The most common example is when capturing
panorama images where one wants to rotate the camera system about the zero parallax
point in order to avoid so called parallax errors. This is important because rotating
the camera about an arbitrary axis means that the relative positions on the image plane of a close object
and a distant object will be different between two photographs, and thus impossible to
seamlessly stitch and blend together.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are many procedures one might employ to determine this zero parallax distance and indeed
some professional lenses have it marked on the barrel lens. One simple procedure is to align the
camera simultaneously with a close object  and a more distant one. By definition, if the
camera is rotated to the left or right, then these two objects will remain aligned only
if the lens is rotated about an axis at
the zero parallax. This is illustrated below, obviously the camera is
on a tripod and has an easy rotating capability. One can do this procedure by eye but for
more precision one can take photographs with the camera rotated clockwise and anticlockwise
from the central position, this is repeated for different positions. Three such positions
are shown below where a nail and distant lamp post are used for the aligned objects. The
relative placement of the nail can be observed for positions of the camera that are less
than, equal to and greater than the zero parallax distance.

<p align="justify">
The upper and lower image
is also a nice illustration as to why such images cannot be perfectly blended together if part of
a mosaic or panorama. One could align them to blend the nail or the lamp post, but not both. This
can clearly be achieved for the images in the middle figure.
