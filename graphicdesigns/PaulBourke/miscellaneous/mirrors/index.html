<h1>Having fun with Mirrors and Raytracers</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
October 1997<p>
<b>Question</b>: What happens inside a room with one light source and perfectly mirrored walls?
</center>
<p><br><p>

In what follows the standard geometric arrangement 
as shown below will be used.
A cubic room, one light source to the left of the camera, a red cross
made of reflective cylinders, and a blue reflective sphere in the center.
<p>
<center><img src="http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/mirrors/mirrors1.gif" border=2></center><p>
The walls are turned into perfectly reflective surfaces, at least
as perfect as the traditional raytracing software (StrataStudio)
being used would allow. 
<p>
<center><img src="http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/mirrors/mirrors2.gif" border=2></center><p>
Obviously since there is some loss at the
interface the surfaces are not perfect reflectors.
<p>
The second thing to note when rendering such a scene with highly reflective
surfaces is that raytracers don't follow rays "forever".
Normally the software stops considering a ray after a certain number of
bounces (intersections) with objects. This is perfectly reasonable with
common non reflective surfaces but not in this example. Typically,
the default number of bounces is only 2 or 3, the previous image is a rendering
of the scene with only a few bounces being considered.
The effect is that it appears we have an adjacent room at each wall, we
should have an infinite progression of virtual rooms!
<p>

By comparison, consider the same rendering but with a much higher number
of bounces, 10 in this case.
As expected, such renderings take significantly longer to compute.
<p>

Switching now to software which supports more realistic surface
behaviour, namely Radiance. In the next 3 renderings the wall surfaces
are varied from shiny metal into a perfect mirror. In all three cases the
maximum number of bounces is 100.

The renderings here are created using a ray tracing package, in this case PovRay, and
the simple geometry (shown above) consisting of a plane, a single cylinder, and a sphere.
The three primitives are made highly reflective and the virtual camera inspects the 
gap between the sphere/cylinder pair and the plane. The variation in the renderings
below is achieved by adjusting the colours of the three surfaces as well as the
colour and number of light sources.

The ring of bright light acts like an attractor, that is, it is insensitive to 
the positions of the light sources illuminating the scene.
