<h1>Fun with Pico Projectors</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
July 2010<p>

<p align="justify">
The latest round of ultra small data projectors, also known as pico-projectors, are
certainly interesting and opening up a number of opportunities.
The following is a look as some possible "left field" applications for these projectors.
The units chosen were a pair of laser projectors from AAXA, one of the more interesting
things about the laser projectors is the lack of any lens and as such the image is always 
in focus even if the distance to the projected surface varies (for example, if the 
axis of the projector is not perpendicular to the surface). The unit used is the L1, 800x600
and 20 lumens. 
It should be noted that the comments here will date quickly as these products evolve.
At the time of writing there are brighter units on the market but few that are as small
and quiet as this unit.

<b>Fulldome projection</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Fulldome projection is implemented in three ways: spherical mirror (by the author),
fisheye lens, and multiple tiled projectors. The highest resolution domes are still achieved
by using multiple projectors, typically between 4 and 7. For small domes one consideration is
the space required for the projectors, this is particularly important for the iDome (shown below).
So, could these pico projectors provide a solution? The following gives an idea of the image coverage
for one and two projectors. There is obviously a trade-off between resolution (the number of
projectors and their field of view) and system complexity. More projectors means greater resolution
but at the expense of a complicated edge-blending across a large number of projectors.
The general conclusion was that when these projectors reach XGA resolution (1024x768) and around
100 lumens, then they may be a viable option.

<b>Tiled display</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Without the constraints of filling a dome one might consider using the projectors for
a more standard flat wall tiled display. The set-up below employs the two projectors in a side-by-side
arrangement, the images overlap and are blended to give a seamless result. Generally it is
difficult to physically align two projected images exactly, especially (as in this case) if they have low
grade optical properties. The solution is to only roughly overlay the images and perform the alignment
of the projected images in software, along with the edge-blending. The middle row of images
below shows the unaligned grid (when projecting the operating system), the image on the right
shows a perfectly aligned grid when corrected in software. 
The information in this grid is used when presenting subsequent images.

<p align="justify">
Unfortunately at this point one of the projectors developed a severe colourisation
effect, see last two images above. This is not intended to be a review of these 
projectors but their reliability is in some question. During the 3-4 hours of use
for these experiments the colour effect mentioned above occurred, one of the DC transformers
failed, and the units needed frequent rebooting. They do seem to be running MSWindows CE
so perhaps this unreliability is what one should expect from MS products.
</p>

<b>Stereoscopic display</b><p>

<p align="justify">
How about stereo? The projectors are nice and small so the images can be overlaid and require
minimal image geometry correction for the key-stone error.
The the stereo technique used is using polaroid filters at 90 degrees to each other.
Unfortunately the light from the laser projectors is prepolarised, along the horizontal
axis. This pretty much precludes their use for polaroid based stereoscopic projection.

<b>Addendum</b><p>
It has been pointed out by Andrew Woods that two options are possible. <br>
<ul>
<li>Use a quarter wave polariser to convert the linear polarisation to 
circular polarisation.<br>
<li>Use a half wave retarder to rotate the polarisation +45 or -45 degrees. 
</ul>
