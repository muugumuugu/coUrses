<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p align="justify">
Steady states and global dynamics of electrical activity in the 
cerebral cortex are investigated within the framework of a 
recent continuum model. It is shown that, for a particular 
physiologically realistic class of models, at most three steady 
states can occur, two of which are stable. The global dynamics of 
spatially uniform activity states is studied and it is shown that, 
in a physiologically realistic 
class of models, the adiabatic dynamics is governed by a 
second-order differential equation equivalent to that for the 
motion of a Newtonian particle in a potential in the presence 
of friction. This result is used to derive a simplified dynamical 
equation in the friction-dominated limit. Solutions of these 
equations are compared with those of the full global dynamics 
equations and it is found that they are adequate for time-scales 
longer than approximately 100 ms provided dendritic integration 
times are less than approximately l0 ms.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify">
Recently we developed a continuum model for the propagation 
of electrical activity in the cerebral cortex [1]. This model 
traced the evolution of quantities such as the neuronal firing 
rate, averaged over volumes large enough to contain many 
neurons, as in several previous works [2-9]. Both excitatory 
and inhibitory neuronal populations were included, as were 
the effects of nonlinear neural responses, temporal integration 
in the dendrites and propagation time delays in the axons. This 
model allowed us to write down equations for dynamics, steady 
state solutions, and dispersion and stability of linear waves.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The above model did not include the effects of feedback on the 
basic parameters of the cortex, such as the threshold potential 
for neuronal firing, and the effective strengths of coupling 
between various neuronal populations. Such feedbacks are known 
to be of central importance in the dynamics of the actual cortex: 
the state of arousal (e.g., relaxed vs. alert) strongly affects the 
cortical response to stimuli as measured by electroencephalograms 
(EEGs), for example [10]. Such responses are normally termed 
evoked response potentials (ERPs). These responses depend not 
only upon fast cortical responses on time scales well below 
100 ms (e.g., voltage-dependent changes in ion conductivities of 
neuronal membranes), but on feedbacks that evolve over longer 
intervals (e.g., the action of chemical neurotransmitters) [11].
</p>

<p align="justify">
Another area in which feedbacks are of importance is
in the onset and termination of seizures. It is likely that the 
cortex operates in a state close to marginal stability [1] so as 
to be stable, but not so stable that all interesting behaviour is 
suppressed. Normal subjects are not prone to spontaneous seizures, 
whereas in epilepsy, for example, the cortex can undergo a transition 
to a seizure state in which all the neurons are firing at far above 
their normal rate. Such seizures are not permanent-some feedback 
mechanism acts to return the brain to its normal state after seconds 
or minutes [6,10].
</p>

<p align="justify">
The purpose of the present work is to understand better the steady 
states and dynamics of a generalized version of the model introduced 
in our previous work [1]. In Sec. II we study the possible steady-state 
solutions of the generalized model, deriving a steady-state equation 
and limits on the maximum number of steady states in certain cases. 
These steady states, and their basins of attraction, determine the 
qualitative dynamics in the absence of feedback, and provide strong 
constraints on the dynamics more generally for slow feedbacks. In 
Sec. III we study how the steady states and their interrelationships 
depend on the underlying parameters of the model, demonstrating 
that a class of models that is particularly plausible physiologically 
has simple properties in this respect, possessing only three 
steady states.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Many observations of electrical activity in the cortex are made at
relatively coarse spatial scales. EEGs, for example, often use scalp 
electrodes separated by several cm, while most short-scale features 
are filtered out as a result of the conductivity of the cerebrospinal fluid,
skull, and scalp in any case [6]. Hence, in Sec. IV, we study the large-scale 
dynamics of the cortex. Furthermore, we do this in a simplified way by 
specializing to adiabatic dynamics on time scales much larger than the 
dendritic integration time, which is of order 5 - 10 ms [1,4]. We show 
that the spatially uniform global dynamics of the cortex can be described 
by an equation that is equivalent to that of a Newtonian particle moving 
under the influence of friction in a potential whose minimums define the 
stable steady states of the system. When friction dominates it is also 
possible to write down a simplified first-order equation for the adiabatic 
dynamics in the governing potential. Numerical results show that these 
adiabatic equations approximate the dynamics well for time scales 
exceeding ~100 ms. They will enable the qualitative dynamical effects 
of various types of feedback to be determined by looking at their effects 
on the potential and the resulting "forces" on the system. This ability 
is relevant to any analysis of feedback processes that adiabatically 
modify the basins of attraction of the steady-state solutions of the 
dynamical equations. Faster feedback mechanisms also interact with 
the basins of attraction, but an adiabatic approximation is not possible.
