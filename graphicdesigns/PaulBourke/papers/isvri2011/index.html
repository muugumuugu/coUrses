This session builds on creative innovations that have been made over the last ten years at the Applied Laboratory of Interactive Visualization and Embodiment (ALIVE), Hong Kong; UNSW iCinema Research Centre, Sydney; ZKM Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe; iVEC, University of Western Australia, Perth and at Museum Victoria, Melbourne. The session is intended to compliment the preceding Keynote 2 by Sarah Kenderdine and Jeffrey Shaw.
<br>
This session describes pioneering work in the development of capture solutions and applications in stereographic video, panoramic video and full frame fisheye. It offers participants technical and creative insights in the use of these technologies for a variety of unique immersive and interactive display systems. The works include artistic, scientific, museological, entertainment and industrial applications.
