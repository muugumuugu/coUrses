The sense of immersion and presence, or "being there", is enhanced and perhaps even requires that the entire human visual field of view be filled with the virtual digital world. In the applications to film this is often referred to as "removing the frame", in reference to the frame we see around content in our day-today experience of digital media. While immersion has been exploited and studied for many years in virtual reality applications such as training simulators, the price point for devices such as a CAVE or high resolution HMDs (Head mounted displays) has been generally prohibitive. Additionally there were a lack of common standards and software support resulting in bespoke installations. The Oculus Rift is a possible step towards commodity based stereo3D capable HMDs. The iDome is an example of a screen based immersive environment with installations at UWA, ECU and Curtin University.
