<h1>Stereoscopy, Theory and Practice</h1>
<a href="../index.html">P.D. Bourke</a>, P. Morse<br>
Workshop at: VSMM 2007: Exchange and Experience in Space and Place.<br>
September 2007, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane<br>

<p align="justify">
This workshop will cover a wide range of topics related to stereoscopy from both a 
theoretical and practical point of view. It will include a comparative discussion of the 
technology both now and in the future as well as cover how one creates effective 
stereoscopic content. Specific topics that will be covered are: the creation of synthetic 
stereoscopic pairs, still photography and video capture, viewing/projection options and 
their relative merits, the limitations inherent in the current technology, some of the 
new and future possibilities for stereoscopic viewing/projection, and how to create 
content exhibiting minimal eye strain. A stereoscopic viewing system will be available 
to illustrate the various principles and to show examples of work from practitioners in 
the field.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This workshop will be targeted at a general audience, some experience or knowledge 
of digital image processing and 3D modelling/rendering would be an advantage. 
Programming or an in depth knowledge of a particular 3D package is not expected 
although the presenters will be available to discuss more technical questions at the end 
of the workshop.
</p>
<p align="justify">
By the end of the workshop attendees will have a general overview of the whole field 
as well as a good foundation of the underlying theory and therefore be able to 
independently address issues and problem solve in this field.
Attendees interested in stereo photography are encouraged to bring a digital camera 
and laptop (with image editing software) for experiment capturing, editing, and 
presenting images on the projection system provided.
