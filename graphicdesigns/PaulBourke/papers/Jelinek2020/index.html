<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Background.
Temporal and 2-dimensional measures of reach distance and joint angles, centre of pressure 
and centre of mass (CoM) are common features investigated in clinical and sports settings to 
determine postural stability or movement variability. However, postural stability or movement 
variability are complex, nonlinear, multidimensional patterns requiring a 3D model of movement 
variability. The current study therefore applied a 3-dimensional representation of changes in 
CoM whilst undertaking a balance test.

<p align="justify">
Methods. 
The box-counting fractal analysis method was applied in 3-dimensions to the x,y,z data 
obtained during a Y-Balance Test (YBT) and the 3-dimensional fractal dimension (3DFd) of 
CoM dispersion. Twenty participants were recruited to undertake the YBT, which required 
participants to stand on their dominant leg and maximally stretch the non-dominant leg 
in the anterior, posterolateral and posteromedial direction. CoM provides an indication 
of whole body movement variability as it is based on vertical and horizontal sway. 
Participants were tested with and without support taping (static tape, ST) applied to 
the ankle, lower leg and thigh. 3-dimensional motion capture data and ground reaction 
forces were used to calculate CoM following kinetic and kinematic assessment of the 
pelvis and lower limb.

Results.
Static taping significantly decreased or increased 3DFd of CoM dispersion (postural sway) 
compared to no taping, whilst maximum reach, a traditional 2-dimensional measure, 
found no significant differences. Twelve participants had greater 3DFd with ST versus 
control (Mean&plusmn;SD; 1.3&plusmn;0.05 & 1.26&plusmn;0.06; p=0.0003) whereas eight participants had 
lower 3DFd (1.2&plusmn;0.05 & 1.29&plusmn;0.05; p=0.005). 
</p>

Conclusion.
Our results identify 3DFd as a robust method to investigate postural stability, which 
provides objective data on the complexity of CoM dispersion during the YBT and the 
effect of taping. The 3-dimensional analysis provides a more complete indication of 
complexity compared to current 2-dimensional movement variability measures, measures 
of movement variability should consider vertical changes in addition to horizontal 
sway. Future work will include a larger sample size and investigate factors that may 
have contributed to increased or decreased complexity and effect of taping.
