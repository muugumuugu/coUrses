<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Visualisation is the process of applying computer graphics and other algorithms to data with the aim of providing insight into the underlying structures, relationships and processes. As such, visualisation has application across a wide range of disciplines especially those with datasets that are large or contain complicated relationships that need to be explored and understood. While visualisation may employ other senses such as hearing (sonification) and touch (haptics), the predominant means of communicating with the human brain is through the sense of sight. As data size, dimensionality and complexity grows it becoming increasingly necessary to use sophisticated algorithms and display hardware. The resulting visual outcomes are employed for a range of purposes; sometimes they are only applicable to the researcher and their peers, often they are used to convey and inform a wider audience. Since the results may be visually appealing they can be used to engage a general audience in education and public outreach.

In this presentation I will outline some of the new, immersive and engaging technologies being explored by researchers in Western Australia. This will include display technology such as high resolution head tracked stereoscopic displays, HMDs and immersive dome displays, as well as various means for creating physical objects based upon research data such as autostereoscopic prints and general 3D printing.
