<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Here we present a new algorithm that could be employed to procedurally generate a range of 
gaming assets including 2 dimensional textures, 2.5 dimensional texture, and 3 dimensional 
geometry. The approach involves placing shapes randomly, without overlap and with a 
monotonically decreasing area, within a region on a plane (2 dimensional texture) or 
within a volume (3 dimensional). If the process is continued to infinity then the 
result is space filling thus providing a variable and infinite degree of visual 
detail. It will be proposed/illustrated that the process is independent of the actual 
shape being used and as such can find a wide range of potential applications.
