<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Despite the large budgets spent annually on astronomical research 
equipment such as telescopes, instruments and supercomputers, the 
general trend is to analyse and view the resulting datasets using small, 
two-dimensional displays. We report here on alternative advanced image 
displays, with an emphasis on displays that we have constructed, 
including stereoscopic projection, multiple projector tiled displays and a 
digital dome. These displays can provide astronomers with new ways of 
exploring the terabyte and petabyte datasets that are now regularly being 
produced from all-sky surveys, high-resolution computer simulations, and 
Virtual Observatory projects. We also present a summary of the Advanced 
Image Displays for Astronomy (AIDA) survey which we conducted from 
March-May 2005, in order to raise some issues pertinent to the current and 
future level of use of advanced image displays.
