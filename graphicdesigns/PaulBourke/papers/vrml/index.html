Visualisation is a powerful tool for understanding the large data sets typical of
astronomical surveys and can reveal unsuspected relationships and anomalous regions of 
parameter space which may be difficult to find programatically. Visualisation is a classic
information technology for optimising scientific return. We are developing a number of
generic on-line visualisation tools as a component of the Australian Virtual Observatory
project. The tools will be deployed within the framework of the International Virtual
Observatory Alliance (IVOA), and follow agreed-upon standards to make them accessible by
other programs and people. We and out IVOA partners plan to utilise new information technologies 
(such as grid computing and web services) to advance the scientific return of existing and
future instrumentation.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Here we present a new tool - VOlume - which visualises point data. Visualisation of
astronomical data normally requires the local installation of complex software, the
downloading of potentially large datasets, and very time consuming and tedious data
format conversions. VOlume enables the astronomer to visualise data using just a web
browser and plug-in. This is achieved using IVOA standards which allow us to pass
data between Web Services, Java Servlet Technology and Common Gateway Interface programs.
Data from a catalogue server can be streamed in eXtensible Mark-up Language format to a servlet
which produces Virtual Reality Modelling Language output. The user selects elements of the
catalogue to map to geometry and then visualises the result in a browser plug-in such as
Cortona or FreeWRL.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Other than requiring an input VOTable format file, VOlume is very general. While its
major use will likely be to display and explore astronomical source catalogues, it can easily
render other important parameter fields such as the sky and redshift coverage of proposed surveys
or the sampling of the visibility plane by a
rotation-synthesis interferometer.
