<b>Abstract</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Heritage management in the spatial dimension: a methodological case study of the pros and cons of high resolution rock 
art recording in the East Pilbara, Western Australia.
In 2014 Rio Tinto commissioned UWA Centre for Rock Art Research, Curtin University School of Spatial Sciences and 
IVEC to undertake a detailed rock art recording programme of 4 rock art sites at West Angelas in the East Pilbara region 
of Western Australia. As well as applying traditional rock art recording methodologies the project also aimed to produce 
a full dynamic record of the sites that could be recreated in the virtual or physical world should the Traditional Owners 
wish. In order to achieve this, the team undertook high resolution recording of the sites using photogrammetry and 
laser scanning. This paper examines the technology and methods applied to this project and the associated results 
within the constraints of a cultural heritage management context.
