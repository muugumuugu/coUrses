<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
The use of data capture and visualisation technologies has grown dramatically, embracing the needs of researchers, stakeholder communities, cultural resource managers, tourists and the general public. In this paper we preview the types of techniques being used by Australian rock art researchers in a range of study areas. The digital acquisition and visualisation of rock art (and other archaeological sites) using photographic techniques (hardware and software), 3D reconstruction, laser scanning and other methods, along with novel methods for presentation provide us with opportunities not available even 5 years ago. The challenge for researchers is to maintain the theoretical impetus in the face of a plethora of new technologies and opportunities. Methods to enhance recording and to facilitate research methodologies are explored. And the types of opportunities being deployed by cultural resource managers and Aboriginal communities to manage their heritage (e.g. with tourists in interpretive displays and other virtual media) are highlighted.
