<b>Abstract</b>:<br>
<p align="justify">
I will present a number of projects completed in 2011. They each had their own 
challenges mostly with respect to the requirement for high resolution/fidelity of the 
final movies, around 4000 pixels wide in both cases. One is a pure science 
visualisation project with ICRAR (International Centre for Radio Astronomy 
Research) in collaboration with Dr Alan Duffy. It involved visualisation of 
data from three different particle simulations but they had enough in common that a 
single rendering pipeline could be created. Each particle (stars, gas, dark matter) 
is not a point source but generally has a smoothing kernel, a region of influence in 
the simulation that can be effectively utilised in the visualisations. The 
simulations involve large scale structures in the Universe, namely galaxies and 
galaxy distribution, and employ between 200 million and 1 billion particles.

A second project, in collaboration with Dr Peter Morse, was created for an 
exhibition in the new MONA (Museum of New and Old Art) located in Hobart. In 
addition to the volume visualisation and animation the whole presentation system and 
software was developed, this included a double HD projection system built within a 
very confined space. One of the key challenges was acquiring a CT scan of the 
Pausiris mummy at a sufficient resolution. The solution involved scanning the 
mummy in three sections and the subsequent volumetric analysis required to 
assemble the three volumes that had undergone not only translations but also 
rotations. In the museum the digital representation lies alongside the physical 
mummy casket, the final animations reveal the interior of the mummy which has not 
previously been revealed.
