<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
This paper examined whether the reaction time and gaze behaviours of participants
were different, when they sidestepped from a standing position to simulate an interception of
2D versus 3D projections of an oncoming opponent. To achieve this, a customised
stereoscopic system was integrated with an opto-reflective motion analysis system and a gaze
tracker, forming a novel Integrated Stereoscopic System (ISS). Component parts of the ISS
were synchronised using a custom interface. Following synchronization, the ISS was used to
record the 3D kinematics and gaze behaviours of 10 males, when they responded to the 2D
and 3D opponents. Participants spent significantly less time (16%) fixating on the trunk and
more time outside the body (23%) of the 3D opponent compared with the 2D stimulus. The
time taken to intercept the opponent in the 2D and 3D conditions was not significantly
different. Differences were found between the participants visual search behaviour, but not
time to initiate a sidestep, when perceiving 3D compared with 2D stimuli. The additional
depth cues provided by the 3D stimulus may have allowed participants to perform the
interception task equally well across both conditions even though less time was spent fixating
on the 3D opponent's body.
