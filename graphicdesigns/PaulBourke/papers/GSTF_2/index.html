<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Presented here is a case for a higher level of engagement and immersion in gaming by 
proposing gaming software support for displays that engage the players peripheral 
vision. It is widely accepted that the sense of "being there" or "presence" 
is heightened by "removing the frame", that is, filling the 
viewers field of view with a virtual environment. Except for a few special 
cases this is almost entirely unsupported in current commodity games, and yet the 
importance is readily accepted as is illustrated by the widespread use in commercial 
simulators and virtual reality environments. This paper will present the general 
requirements necessary to support a range of seamless immersive 
displays, that is, displays that engage a significant portion, if not all, of the 
users field of view. It will further outline a software pipeline split into two parts, a 
generic section that generates the necessary visual information followed by a 
section that handles the device/display specific details. 

</p>
<p align="justify">
Part of the motivation stems from the realisation that there are many possible 
hardware configurations for immersive displays and it would be too high a 
burden on the software developer to support them all.  Equally the installation 
supplier does not have access to the underlying software engine or source code. The 
proposed solution then is to separate the problem into two pieces, those that are the 
responsibility of the software developer and those that are the responsibility of the 
display provider.
