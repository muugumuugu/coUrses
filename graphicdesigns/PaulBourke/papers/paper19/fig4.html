<b>Figure 4</b><br>
Patterns of connectivity from a single point in the non-granular layers (site of tracer injection shown with black dot). The sites where the connections terminate are coloured with the orientation preference at those points in the map. The connections traverse the entire surface of V1, connect to regions of similar orientation preference as the site of origin, and overlie the shape of an oriented line having of an angle matching the orientation preference of the site of tracer injection.
