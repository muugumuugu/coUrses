<b>Figure 5</b><br>
Simulation of orientation preference in the LGS model using type II input connectivity. In this experiment the network was stimulated with moving bars and small moving blobs. The false colour map of orientation preference is also marked with projections from the foveal region of the input layer (black boundaries). There are projections from the foveal region of the input layer into pinwheal of orientation preference in the non-granular layers. In the foveal region of the non-granular layer, these indirect foveal projections tend to coincide with singularities. In the parafoveal region of the non-granular layer, the orientation preference at sites of the these indirect foveal projections changes systematically, depending on the retinotopic polar angle.
