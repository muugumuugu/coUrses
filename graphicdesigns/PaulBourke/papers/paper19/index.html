<h3>Abstract</h3> 
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Results from a neural network 
simulation of the cellular organisation in the mammalian 
primary visual cortex indicate that the patterns of 
orientation preference may be accounted for by the 
interactions of two visuotopic mappings, one global and the 
other local. The local visuotopic maps emerge through self-
organisation from a set of initially random inputs. We 
describe computer modelling of the development of orientation 
preference in V1 which relies on two assumptions: 1) the 
receptive fields develop due to a simple excitatory-centre / 
inhibitory-surround mechanism, and 2) in addition to the 
direct relay of visuotopic inputs, information from any point 
in the global visuotopic map can reach any point in the non-
granular layers via poly-synaptic routes. Hebbian learning is 
applied to these indirect inputs while the network is 
stimulated with a moving bar. The computer modelling shows 
that all the key geometrical features of orientation 
preference; singularities, linear zones and saddle-points, 
emerge consequent to the learning, as in other simulations of 
this general type. We then show that these features 
additionally imply the existence of the double visuotopic 
mapping. The various response properties measured in V1, and 
the regular geometrical relationships between them, are 
explained in terms of the interaction of these two mappings. 
The existence of visuotopically organised local maps suggests 
that CO blobs in the macaque may represent the projections 
from the fovea, via indirect inputs, into the non-granular 
layers.</P>

<h3>1 Introduction</h3>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following identification of the 
stochastic patterns of eye dominance and orientation 
preference in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968; 
1977) a number of theoretical models have been developed to 
account for these patterns. In a recent review (Swindale, 
1996) the models were distinguished into a number of 
categories, two of which are of particular relevance to the 
present work.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first category includes models 
depending upon neural network principles, all of which 
originate from the work of von der Malsburg (e.g. von der 
Malsburg 1973, Linsker 1986c, Miller et al 1989, Tanaka 1989, 
Obermayer et al 1990, Goodhill 1993). These all share a 
common set of postulates, namely the use of Hebbian synapses 
with normalised synaptic strength, spatio-temporal 
correlation in afferent activity during training, and 
connections between cortical neurons which are locally 
excitatory and inhibitory at slightly greater distance at the 
minicolumnar scale. Under these assumptions a realistic 
spatial ordering of response properties emerges in two-
dimensional arrays of neurons.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Models in the second category give an 
account of the same response organisation in terms of 
dimension reduction (Kohonen 1982, 1988, Mitchison and Durbin 
1986, Durbin and Willshaw 1987, Durbin and Mitchison 1990). 
Here the higher dimensional complexity of information in the 
afferents is shown to be reduced to the two-dimensional 
cortical surface by an inverse mapping endeavouring to 
satisfy two conflicting goals, namely, the need to maintain 
local smoothness in the cortical sheet, versus the need to 
ensure the sheet passes through a representative selection of 
points in stimulus space. Optimisation of this mapping 
solution yields results very similar to the neural network 
models.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present modelling belongs in the first 
category, that of neural network models, differing in emphasis 
from earlier models in only one respect of relevance. The 
further assumption is made that any point in the input field 
can potentially influence any point in the visual cortical 
surface, beginning with random, weak connectivity. The 
anatomical rationale for this assumption is further discussed 
below, but may be most simply considered a consequence of the 
convergent and divergent properties of dendritic and axonal 
trees respectively. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will show that with this assumption a 
previously unrecognised aspect of the mapping of the stimulus 
field to the visual cortex can be demonstrated. Namely, that 
there exist two distinct, visuotopic mappings of the visual 
field into the primary sensory cortex. The first mapping is 
the classical retinotopic, global projection of the visual 
field to V1, and the second is a local mapping of the entire 
visual field, multiple copies of which tile the non-granular 
layers of V1. The hypothesised existence of this double 
mapping, called the local-global map (LGM) hypothesis, is a 
priori to the present modelling and has been reported 
elsewhere (Alexander et al, 1997; 1998).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key finding reported in this paper is 
that the local mappings of the visuotopic field spontaneously 
emerge robustly under a range of conditions. Assumptions 
required in the modelling of orientation preference in the 
tree shrew are:</P>

<DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a) cortical elements within a local 
neighbourhood interact via a standard excitatory-centre / 
inhibitory-surround (a so-called Mexican-hat field) .</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b) The retina projects to the primary 
visual cortex in the standard visuotopic manner, but 
additional to this direct topographic mapping, any visuotopic 
point may contribute some input to any point in the non-
granular layers. These diffuse, indirect projections are 
initially weak and are considered to arise from converging 
and diverging polysynaptic pathways within V1.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c) Hebbian learning applies to synapses 
supplying cortical input to the non-granular layers via the 
indirect, diffuse pathway.</P>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this paper we will discuss empirical 
evidence largely drawn from the tree shrew (which forms the 
template of the present modelling results), and use 
supplementary material from the macaque monkey (which 
provides further evidence for the LGM hypothesis).</P>


<h3>2.1 Orientation preference and connectivity in V1</h3>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The response properties of V1 are well 
catalogued. These properties have been mapped through single-
cell studies (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968), metabolic transport 
studies (Tootell et al, 1988<U>a</U>; 1988<U>b</U>; 
1988<U>c</U>) and optical imaging of the cortical surface 
(Blasdel, 1992; Blasdel and Salama, 1986). These studies have 
shown that V1 exhibits a distinctive tiling of various 
response properties (Blasdel, 1992), such as orientation 
preference, colour selectivity and contrast sensitivity. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Layer 4 of the primary visual cortex has a 
strict retinotopic organisation (Blasdel and Fitzpatrick, 
1984). In Layer 4 of the tree shrew the distortion of the 
visual hemi-field is much less marked than in other mammals, 
so that to a first approximation the retinotopic organisation 
of the tree shrew may be regarded as the same shape as the 
visual hemi-field. In the macaque, each hemi-retina becomes 
represented, through a complex logarithmic transformation, as 
an almond shaped map in layer 4C of V1 (Tootell et al, 
1988<U>a</U>). </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The geometry of orientation preference 
reveals three predominant features: singularities, linear 
zones and saddle regions (Blasdel, 1992). Orientation 
preference changes continuously around points, or 
singularities. These roughly circular pinwheels traverse 
180 degrees of all possible orientation preference. Between adjacent 
singularities, running parallel to the ocular dominance 
bands, are regions in which orientation preference changes 
slowly and continuously. These regions are called linear 
zones. Other regions between singularities show a local 
minima in orientation preference in one direction and a local 
maxima in a perpendicular direction: so-called saddle points. 
Singularities surrounding saddle-points form mirror images of 
each other, through orthogonal reflection lines. The double 
reflections have the effect of allowing orientation 
selectivity to change continuously between adjacent 
pinwheels. An orientation preference map, in this case taken 
from the tree shrew, is shown in 
<a href="fig1a.html">figure 1a</a>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Studies using injections of retrograde and 
antereograde tracer have revealed underlying regularities in 
patchy intrinsic connections within the supragranular layers 
of V1 (Blasdel et al, 1985; Malach et al, 1993; Rockland and 
Lund, 1983; Bosking et al, 1997). These connections traverse 
the grey matter parallel to the cortical surface in the 
supragranular layers and project to discrete patches or 
targets, sometimes several millimetres from the site of 
tracer injection. Use of these tracer techniques in 
conjunction with other imaging techniques has revealed that 
patchy connections tend to prefer targets with the same 
response properties. (Malach et al, 1993; Yoshioka et al, 
1996). The spatial pattern of these patchy intrinsic 
connections is therefore closely related to the spatial 
pattern of other response-property systems. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has recently been shown, in the primary 
visual cortex of the tree shrew, that the patchy intrinsic 
connections are not perfectly radial, but form an elongated 
pattern (Bosking et al, 1997; see 
<a href="fig1c.html">figure 1c</a>). The axis of 
elongation corresponds to the preferred orientation of the 
injection site. In other words, if tracer is injected into a 
point in the supragranular layers with a preferred 
orientation of 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">, the 
pattern of patchy intrinsic connections overlies a global, 
retinotopic representation of a line passing through that 
point and having an orientation 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif"> (where 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif"> of the line equals 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">
in the pinwheel of orientation preference). In the tree 
shrew, unlike the macaque and the cat, these patchy intrinsic 
fibres are seen to traverse the entire surface of V1 along 
the elongated axis. In the present modelling of orientation 
preference in the tree shrew, these long range patchy fibres 
are assumed to be the source of orientation tuning. Thus in 
our modelling of the development of connectivity in the tree 
shrew we rely on Hebbian-type selection from initially random 
connections, to generate patchy intrinsic connectivity. In 
accord with this, anatomical studies of postnatal development 
of area 17 in the Ferret suggest the patchy intrinsic 
connections form from an initially diffuse set of random 
connections in the upper layers (Ruthazer and Stryker, 
1996).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a href="fig1c.html">Figure 1c</a> 
shows axonal targets of neurons 
spreading from a site of tracer injection. However, since 
like orientation preference is connected to like, the 
connections are reciprocal, and a diagram of axonal targets 
to a similar sized site would look much the same. Inputs 
located along a global axis 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">, 
converge into the orientation pinwheel at orientation 
preference 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">
. 
The pattern of inputs to a pinwheel recapitulates the pattern 
of global input connections; the primary difference between 
the two being a doubling of the retinotopic angles in the 
pinwheel, so that the two halves of the global line project 
to the same place in the pinwheel. </P>


<h3>2.2 Connectivity types and computer modelling</h3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the modelling of orientation preference 
in the tree shrew to be reported we use long range intra-
cortical connections based on the anatomy seen in 
supragranular layers in the tree shrew (called type I 
indirect inputs). Each mini-column in the non-granular layer 
was also connected to every other mini-column. In a second 
model, we use a another type of long range intra-cortical 
connectivity, which connects each retinotopic location in the 
input layer to every mini-column in the non-granular layer 
(called type II indirect inputs). These connections are based 
on anatomical projections seen in the macaque. The type II 
indirect inputs are included in the modelling to show its 
generality, since the macaque does not have connections which 
span the entire breadth of the supragranular layers. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the macaque, the lateral connections 
within lamina 4B (and perhaps 4A and 5A) form a likely 
substrate for the all to all mapping assumed in the type II 
indirect inputs. These efferent axons have been shown to 
project laterally up to 4.5 mm in the macaque (Blasdel et al, 
1985; Rockland and Lund, 1983). The lateral connections show 
periodic accumulations of denser terminal fibres every 375-
400 mm (Blasdel et al, 1985; Rockland and Lund, 1983). These 
patches of connections form a radial pattern with a similar 
spatial periodicity to the cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs 
(Rockland and Lund, 1983). At mid- to long-range distances 
from the cell body, all terminating boutons are within 4B 
itself. Most of the fibres within 4B are preferentially 
horizontal, rather than vertical (Rockland and Lund, 1983). 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether the hypothesised connections for 
the local-input map show the exact pattern predicted by the 
LGM hypothesis in the adult animal remains an open question 
at this stage, for the macaque at least. Difficulty in 
targeting tracer injections into lamina 4B in the macaque 
means the exact pattern of these fibres can only be inferred 
by their relations with the shorter range fibres in the 
supra-granular layers (Rockland and Lund, 1983). </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present modelling of V1 introduces a 
few simplifications into the visual system, and will not 
explicitly deal with ocular dominance, the cortical 
magnification factor, contrast and colour selectivity. The 
resulting simplified model focuses on the development of 
orientation selectivity, and aims to explain data from the 
tree shrew. A more complete model, based on response 
properties in the macaque, is in development.</P>


<h3>3 Modelling the orientation preference with long range 
connections</h3>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A moving bar was repeatedly swept 
across a simplified model retina. Activity in this retina 
then drove activity in the model non-granular layers, via 
direct and indirect pathways. The effects of local 
neighbourhood interactions were then added, using a 
simplified excitatory-centre and inhibitory-surround 
mechanism. The present model is a static, time-averaged 
portrayal of what is never-the-less a dynamically wave-
medium. While more realistic dynamics (Wright, 1998) will add 
to the explanatory scope of the modelling, the present 
description attempts to capture the essential of the 
structural mechanisms involved in the development of 
orientation preference.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As indicated in the previous section, two 
types of input connectivity were used in the modelling. Both 
methods had one set of input connections (called direct 
connections) which supplied retinotopic inputs to the non-
granular layers. Orientation preferences are formed through 
an interaction of the indirect inputs into the non-granular 
layers with the direct inputs, when driven by visual stimuli. 
Type I and type II connections are illustrated in 
<a href="fig2.html">figure 2</a>. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A single line was presented to the 
simulated retina, and the line swept across, each sweep 
taking place at randomly chosen angles. The line moved at a 
constant speed of one retinal pixel per computational time 
step. The presentation of a line to the retina is illustrated 
in 
<a href="fig3.html">figure 3a</a>. 
In some experiments, small blobs (lines of 
length equal to their width) were also swept across the 
retina. The experiments with moving lines and blobs were run 
to see if the indirect connections would self-organise in a 
manner which distinguished these two types of stimuli. The 
type I indirect inputs scaled in number as the square of the 
number of mini-columns and this limited the resolution of the 
experiments which could be run. We were therefore only able 
to test the effect of using both moving lines and blobs using 
type II indirect inputs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The activity of each non-granular unit 
(approximately a mini-column, 30um in diameter) was calculated 
in four steps. The symbols a, b, c, d and e denote the 
activations at successive stages and describe the activations 
on the retina, the effect of direct (retinotopic) input 
connections, indirect input connections, local excitatory 
influence and inhibitory surround, respectively and 
cumulatively. The activation, a, on the retina was fed 
directly to the model cortical mini-columns. No learning 
occurred in relation to these direct, retinotopic 
projections, as they can be assumed to be largely innately 
provided. Equation 1 describes the effects of the direct 
connections on the activation of each mini-column:</P>

<td align=right>1</td></tr></table>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">where w<sub>dj</sub>
 
is the connection weight from a point in the model input 
layer to a point in the model non-granular layer. In the 
results described in this paper the number of mini-columns at 
each retinotopic location in the non-granular layer was set 
to 100. An amount of white noise, 
<img align=middle src="e2.gif">, 
was added at this stage. The modelling results proved 
robust to a wide range of noise values 
(0 <= 
<img align=middle src="e2.gif"><sub>max</sub>
 <= 0.5). The visuotopic projection of the granular layers 
was modelled after the tree shrew, and approximated as an 
undistorted mapping of the hemi-retina. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The indirect connections, 
w<sub>ij</sub>, were initially set to low values drawn from a uniform 
random distribution. Equation 2a shows the contribution from 
indirect connections in the case where type I were used:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The excitatory-centre and inhibitory-
surrounds were not modelled explicitly as local patterns of 
connection, for reasons of computational efficiency. The 
excitatory-centre was implemented by simply averaging the 
activities of each cell with its immediate neighbours:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">where N<sub>e</sub>
 is the number of c<sub>i</sub>
s within the excitatory radius. It the present modelling the 
excitatory radius was set to 7 mini-columns. The inhibitory-
surround was implemented in the following fashion: the number 
of mini-columns, within the inhibitory radius, with activity 
lower than the jth cell was divided by the total number of 
columns within the inhibitory radius. The resulting quotient 
was then multiplied by the activity of the mini-column with 
the highest activation within the inhibitory radius.</P>

activation within that d<sub>j</sub>'s inhibitory radius. The inhibitory radius was 
also set to 7 mini-columns in the results reported here. A 
number of different methods for calculating the Mexican-hat 
field were trialed with little effect on the substantive 
results reported here. Varying the excitatory and inhibitory 
radii had the effect of changing the spatial frequency of the 
singularities in the orientation preference map.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The learning rule was a simple variant of 
Hebbian learning, an approximation of the learning rule 
described by Phillips and Singer (1998). The indirect 
connections were strengthened only when a site was active due 
to the direct, retinotopic projections. The learning rule for 
the two types of input maps are given in equations 5a and 5b 
for type I and type II indirect inputs respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sum of the indirect weights to a given 
mini-column was periodically scaled to a constant during the 
simulation (see equations 2a and 2b). This was assumed to 
reflect some optimal metabolic load for the number of 
synapses on each neuron. Without this regular scaling, the 
magnitudes of activity were more uneven, but the maps of 
orientation preference were qualitatively indistinguishable 
from the runs which included the weight normalisation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The orientation preference map was 
produced in a manner similar to animal studies. During the 
data collection phase, a series of 16 oriented lines were 
swept across the model retina, and the resultant activations 
in each mini-column summed as vectors. The orientation of each 
vector is the orientation of the bar and the magnitude of the 
vector is the activation of the mini-column. The orientation 
preference map is the orientation of the vector sum at each 
mini-column. The magnitude map is the magnitude of the vector 
sum at each mini-column.</P>


<h3>4 Results</h3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modelling orientation preference in the 
Tree Shrew</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presentation of a line to the model 
retina is shown in 
<a href="fig3.html">figure 3a</a>. 
An example of the model cortex, 
activated by a bar, is also shown in 
<a href="fig3.html">figure 3a</a>. 
Results of the modelling using the type I indirect connectivity are 
shown in 
<a href="fig3.html">figure 3b</a>. 
The simulation was run for 20,000 time-
steps or 400 sweeps of the stimulus bar. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The orientation preference map shows 
singularities, saddle-points and linear zones and has the 
same qualitative flavour as orientation preference maps from 
the tree shrew, macaque, cat or ferret primary visual cortex. 
The maps were essentially indistinguishable in relation to 
which method was used to model the indirect-input connections 
(c.f. 
<a href="fig5.html">figure 5</a>). 
<a href="fig3.html">Figure 3c</a> 
is a map of the low magnitude 
regions, with orientation preferences superimposed. The 
result also reflects animal data: lower magnitude regions are 
largely a function of high rates of change of orientation 
preference (Blasdel, 1992). The figure shows only 
singularities and fractures as having a low magnitude vector 
sum.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a> 
shows the connection pattern of a 
subset of the type I indirect connections in the non-granular 
layers. The projections terminate in patchy regions which 
have the same orientation preference as the site of 
injection. In addition, the pattern of patchy connections is 
elongated so that it coincides with the retinotopic 
projection of a line of that orientation . If tracer is 
injected into a large area of the model non-granular layers a 
pattern of connectivity is seen which is similar to that seen 
in the macaque and squirrel monkey (Rockland and Lund 1983). 
For example, an injection covering the central field of 
vision (out to a radius of one quarter of the entire hemi-
retina) shows dense uptake of tracer around the site of 
injection except for the characteristic lacunae or holes in 
the tracer uptake (data not shown). At further distances from 
the site of injection, the tracer uptake becomes more patchy, 
but the connections from the fovea extend to the furthest 
reaches of the visual field. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modelling orientation preference with type 
II indirect input connections</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a href="fig5.html">Figure 5</a> 
shows modelling results for type 
II indirect input connectivity. In this experiment both 
moving blobs and bars were used during training. The map of 
orientation preference is qualitatively the same as for the 
type I indirect inputs, although higher resolution maps could 
be produced due to the smaller number of connections. The 
figure also shows the projection pattern from the foveal 
region of the input layer to the non-granular layer. The 
fovea (taken here as a semi-circle with a radius of a quarter 
of the entire hemi-retina) projects in a patchy fashion to 
all regions in the non-granular layer. In other words, 
portions of every pinwheel of orientation preference contain 
indirect inputs which arise from the fovea. There is a 
systematic pattern of orientation preference at the sites 
these indirect foveal projections. In the foveal region of 
the global map, these indirect foveal projections tend to 
coincide with the singularties. In the parafovea, the 
orientation preference at the sites of these indirect foveal 
projections changes depending on the polar retinotopic angle. 
Indirect projections from either the parafovea, or upper- or 
lower-half of the visual field show similar patchy 
connectivity to the entire surface of the non-granular layer 
(results not shown). These different subsets of patchy 
indirect connections (from fovea, parafovea, upper- or lower-
half) project to partially overlapping areas on the non-
granular surface. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a href="fig6.html">Figure 6</a> 
shows detail of a singularity and 
its surrounding pinwheel of orientation preference. It is 
taken from an experiment with type II indirect input 
connectivity which was stimulated with both moving bars and 
small blobs. It shows the exact indirect input connectivity 
to 64 mini-columns in the surrounding pinwheel. The input maps 
for the mini-columns around the singularity show input 
connections which arise only from around the centre of the 
field of vision, where the pinwheel was positioned. The input 
maps for mini-columns further away from the singularity show a 
much more widespread distribution of input connections. They 
have connections which overly a bar-shape of the appropriate 
orientation preference. Furthest away from the singularity, 
the orientation preference of mini-columns is affected by 
inputs from the furthest reaches of the visual field. These 
longer range inputs were also organised around the 
retinotopic location of the pinwheel, somewhat like a single 
bladed propeller. The indirect input-maps of orientation 
preference pinwheels were organised in this fashion 
regardless of the location of the pinwheel in the model non-
granular layers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modelling results show the structure of 
the local map </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present modelling of orientation 
preference differs from other modelling literature in one 
important respect. The additional assumption used here is 
that any point in the input layer can potentially influence 
activity anywhere in the non-granular layers, where the 
initial influence, tabula rasa, is weak and diffuse. Our 
findings suggest that, with this additional assumption, the 
development of local maps of the entire visual field is 
inevitable and inexorable, and relatively insensitive to the 
other details of the developmental modelling. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this section we use polar coordinates 
to describe the relationships between mini-columns within a 
pinwheel (coordinates of 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif"> 
and r around a singularity, p) and locations in the visual 
field (coordinates of 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif"> and 
R around a point in the visual field, P). The modelling using 
type I indirect inputs shows the same patterns as found in 
vivo in the tree shrew. Each point in the pinwheel of 
orientation preference receives patchy inputs from the entire 
breadth of the visual field along an axis of orientation 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">; this provides each point 
in the local map with the corresponding orientation 
preference of 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">. This 
suggests that in the orientation dimension at least, the 
indirect connections are organised in the form of a local map 
of the visual field. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With type II indirect inputs, and using 
stimuli of moving blobs as well as moving bars, the results 
show that the indirect connections are organised into local 
maps which recapitulate the global map inputs in the 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">
and r dimensions. 
Mini-columns within small radius, r, of a singularity receive 
indirect inputs from within a small radius, R, of the visual 
field. Mini-columns at larger radii from the singularity 
receive indirect inputs from the furthest distances in the 
visual field. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shape of each local map is 
approximately visuotopic. In each of the local maps, the 
hemi-retinal visuotopy is distorted so that 
<img align=middle src="p2.gif"> angles of 
line orientation are represented in 
2<img align=middle src="p2.gif"> of the local map. 
The transformation from the hemi-retina to the local map can 
be expressed in an idealised form as a conformal mapping in 
the z-plane. The local map at retinotopic point P learns 
about the set of lines, L, which activate P i.e. pass over 
that point. The doubling of angles in the local map can be 
approximated by:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">which has the effect of translating the 
set of lines converging on P to the origin (the conformal 
mapping is illustrated in 
<a href="fig7.html">figure 7</a>). 
The singularity is 
formed at point p in the local map, where p is the point in 
the local visuotopic map which corresponds to the point P in 
the global visuotopic map. In other words, the singularity is 
the local map representation of the position of the local map 
in the global retinotopic space. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, consider the pinwheel of 
orientation preference located at the retinotopic point, P, 
in the non-granular layers. We can ascribe coordinates to any 
mini-column, m, within that pinwheel in terms of a distance, 
r, and angle, 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">, from the 
nearest singularity, at p. The modelling results, in essence, 
show that a mini-column, m, receives inputs from the visual 
field at a radius, R, and overlying an oriented line, 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">, passing through the 
point, P, in the visual field. This is the pattern of 
connectivity predicted by the LGM hypothesis and can be 
stated succinctly as a local recapitulation of the global 
visuotopic map. </P>


<h3>5 Conclusions</h3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modelling orientation preference in the 
tree shrew and LGM hypothesis</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To review the primary findings: the 
modelling described in this paper relies on three assumptions 
to explain orientation selectivity in the primary visual 
cortex. These are: a global, visuotopy-preserving mapping 
from the granular to the non-granular layers 
(uncontroversial); an initial, diffuse, disorganised, all to 
all mapping of the retinotopic inputs to the non-granular 
layers; receptive field properties develop through a centre-
excitation / surround-inhibition mechanism. The modelling 
results show the same features for orientation preference 
seen in the tree shrew, including singularities, saddle-
points and linear zones. The connectivity which develops in 
the model also matches the empirical data. When type I 
indirect inputs where used, patchy connections from a site of 
particular orientation preference terminated at sites with 
similar orientation preference. The global shape of these 
patchy projections matched the retinotopic of a line of 
appropriate orientation preference.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modelling results suggest that 
orientation preference arises from the formation of local 
visuotopic mappings which tile the global visuotopic mapping 
in the non-granular layers. This was shown by tracing the 
origins of type II indirect inputs within a pinwheel. Each 
pinwheel of orientation preference has the form of a local 
map of the visual field. This local map recapitulates the 
global visual field in both the 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif">
 and r dimensions. Due to computational 
limitations, we were able to show this recapitulation for 
only the 
<img align=middle src="q2.gif"> dimension using 
type I indirect inputs. We expect that higher resolution maps 
using type I indirect inputs, allowing the use of both moving 
bars and blobs, will show analogous patterns of connectivity 
in the r dimension. Together the global and local visuotopic 
mappings demonstrate the LGM hypothesis of V1 (Alexander et 
al 1997; 1998). The LGM hypothesis of the primary visual 
cortex suggests there is a rather direct relationship between 
globally represented objects (e.g. an oriented line) and 
various other response properties (e.g. orientation 
preference) which have a local geometry.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other features of orientation preference, 
such as linear zones and saddle points, emerge naturally in 
the modelling as smooth border transitions between pinwheels 
of orientation preference. They can also be described, within 
the framework of the LGM hypothesis, as tiling patterns of 
the local map. The relationship between singularities, 
saddle-points and linear zones, as a function of tiling 
pattern of the hypothesised local maps, is illustrated in 
<a href="fig8a.html">figure 8a</a>. 
The basic pattern of the tiling is one in which 
adjacent local maps are reflected about tile borders. This 
tiling pattern creates a saddle-point at the meeting point of 
four adjacent tiles. If one row from this tiling pattern is 
shifted left or right by one tile space, a pattern vertically 
arranged of linear zones results.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modelling described in this paper 
differs from other models of V1 geometry by allowing that any 
point in the visual space can potentially influence response 
properties in the non-granular layers. This additional 
assumption appears to make the present modelling robust to 
parameter variation, in contrast to some other models (c.f. 
Swindale, 1996; 1992). The variations trialed included 
altering the learning and noise parameters, different 
connectivity schemes and several types of the Hebbian 
learning rule. As a rule, each parameter could be varied 
individually by an order of magnitude without affecting the 
results, with two exceptions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only moderately sensitive parameter 
were the variables N<sub>e</sub> and N<sub>i</sub>, which were a function of the radii of local 
excitatory interactions and local inhibitory interactions, 
respectively. Even these parameters did not change the 
substantive results, but outside the optimal range the maps 
of orientation preference contained fewer well-formed 
singularities and a more uneven distribution of total 
activity. Modelling results suggest this sensitivity was a 
side-effect of the method of calculating the excitatory-
centre and inhibitory-surround, which was chosen primarily 
for its computational efficiency rather than anatomical 
exactness. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The robustness of the results is also 
indicated by the similarity of the orientation preference 
maps when type I or type II indirect inputs were used. These 
two connectivity schemes were designed to reflect long range 
intra-cortical connections found in the tree shrew and 
macaque, respectively. The results suggest that the two types 
of indirect connections are functionally the same.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to type I indirect 
connections, the pattern of tracer uptake for a large 
injection site into the model non-granular layer was similar 
to that seen for the supra-granular layers of the macaque and 
the squirrel monkey (Rockland and Lund, 1983) except that the 
patchy connections extended for longer distances. This is the 
pattern which has been inferred for the connectivity of 
lamina 4B in the macaque, suggesting that indeed 4B (along 
with perhaps 4A and 5A) acts as a homologue to the long range 
patchy connections seen in the supra-granular layers of the 
tree shrew. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important result of the modelling 
of orientation preference was that indirect inputs from the 
fovea projected in a patchy fashion to the entire surface of 
the model non-granular layer. This was seen in experiments 
using either the type I or type II indirect inputs. This is 
the expected pattern of indirect connections if indeed they 
are organised into multiple local maps of the entire visual 
field which tile the non-granular layers. It also has 
implications for the LGM hypothesis, suggesting an 
explanation for the distribution of other response properties 
in the non-granular layers such as colour selectivity and 
contrast sensitivity.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generalisation to colour selectivity and 
contrast sensitivity</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our simulations have been concerned with 
orientation preference only, but the simulations need not be 
restricted to this property. The underlying principles appear 
to be general, and could therefore apply to learning of other 
spatially extended qualities of the visual input such as 
colour and contrast. Just as orientation preference is 
ordered as a local map of the entire visual field, the 
organisation of response properties such as colour 
selectivity and contrast sensitivity should also reflect this 
visuotopy.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of particular relevance here is the 
modelling result that inputs from the fovea project in a 
patchy manner to the entire surface of the non-granular 
layer. These projections are blob-like in appearance and are 
spread uniformly across the model non-granular layer. This 
spatial pattern is very similar to the pattern of CO blobs 
seen in the macaque. In essence, the LGM hypothesis states 
that in animals that have CO blobs, the CO blobs contain the 
local map representation of the foveal region of the retina. 
Interblob regions contain the local map representation of the 
parafovea. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CO blobs take up higher levels of CO 
staining because of their higher metabolic activity (Horton 
and Hubel, 1980), and are responsive to colour and low 
contrast. Interblob regions are more selective for high 
contrast (Tootell et al, 1988<U>b</U>; Tootell et al, 
1988<U>c</U>). Alexander et al (1997, 1998) have noted strong 
analogies between the global properties of the hemi-retinal 
image and the response properties in the non-granular layers, 
for the macaque. These are given in table 1. The foveal 
region of the macaque retina has a greater density of 
ganglion cells and contains most of the colour and contrast 
sensitive cones. The parafovea shows the obverse pattern.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We assume these analogies between the 
hemi-retinal image and local maps apply to a geometrical unit 
in the non-granular layers corresponding to 1/4 of a 
hypercolumn. Such a unit includes one CO blob (or portion of 
an elongated CO blob) and one singularity and has the 
approximate dimensions in the macaque of 400 um by 300 um. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a href="fig8c.html">Figure 8c</a> 
shows a region of macaque visual 
cortex in which the local maps have been abstracted from 
imaging and staining data. Singularities and CO blobs are 
marked. The borders of the local maps are defined largely by 
reversals in the orientation preference gradient. The 
resulting abstracted tiling shows that most of the tiles 
contain one singularity and one CO blob (or portion of an 
elongated CO blob). </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The analogies between the global 
properties of the hemi-retinal image and the local response 
properties of the non-granular layers are hypothesised to be 
most obvious in the macaque because of the large changes in 
visual acuity (and other characteristics such as density of 
colour cones) across the visual field. The tree shrew, by 
contrast, does not to have CO blobs, and their concomitant 
response properties, and this is explicable within the LGM 
hypothesis because of the relative uniformity of the visual 
hemi-field in the tree shrew. Cats represent a half-way case, 
with a moderate change in visual acuity from area centralis 
to periphery, no colour vision, and poorly defined CO 
blobs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Predicted relationships between CO blobs 
and singularities</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Singularities and CO blobs both tend to 
lie along the centres of ocular dominance bands (Livingstone 
and Hubel, 1984; Bartfield and Grinvald, 1992; see 
<a href="fig7.html">figure 7a</a>). 
Data from the macaque shows that in up to 15% of cases 
singularities and CO blobs coincide, but that the CO blobs 
tend to lie in between the singularities, along the axis of 
the centre of the ocular dominance band (Bartfield and 
Grinvald, 1992); although this finding has been questioned 
(Crair et al, 1997). In the cat, more systematic data shows a 
closer relationship between CO and singularities; the average 
distance between ocular dominance centre point and nearest 
singularity was found to be 138um. The LGM hypothesis may 
explain the contradictory results of different researchers, 
using different species, regarding the relationship between 
CO blobs and singularities.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consideration of the mapping described in 
equations 7 and 8, in addition to the modelling results 
regarding foveal inputs, leads to a very specific set of 
predictions about the relationship between orientation 
preference and CO blobs in the macaque. The predictions for 
the relationship between CO blobs and singularities are 
illustrated in 
<a href="fig9.html">figure 9</a>, 
which shows the conformal mapping 
expressed in equations 7 and 8 in the context of the macaque. 
The predictions rely on the approximate visuotopy of the 
local maps and the assumption that CO blobs are the local map 
representation of the fovea. When imaging and staining data 
are taken from the foveal region, we expect the CO blobs and 
the singularities to tend to coincide. Data taken from the 
parafovea should show less overlap between the two features, 
and the orientation preference of the CO blobs should change 
systematically depending on the polar angle of the 
retinotopic location of the local map. As the relationship 
between the point P (the retinotopic location of the local 
map) and the fovea changes, so does the relationship between 
p (the singularity) and the CO blob.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Visuotopic maps of contextual 
information</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The LGM interpretation of the origin of 
orientation preference implies a functional consequence 
supplementary to that of the dimension-reduction models 
mentioned in the introduction. Dimension reduction implies 
that an efficient packing of afferent information onto the 
two-dimensional cortical surface has taken place. The LGM 
hypothesis indicates that this mapping is also such as to 
enable any and all local neural processing to make use of 
information originating from a much greater extent of the 
visual field than has previously been theorised.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As noted earlier, the learning rule 
applied here has been derived from that obtained for the 
coherent infomax principle (Phillips and Singer 1997; Kay and 
Phillips 1997). We found this learning rule to be more 
effective and robust within these simulations, than the 
simpler (but closely related) Hebbian learning rules more 
usually applied. Coherent infomax learning maximises the 
transmission of contextually related information, rather than 
maximising information transmission per se. Our results 
appear to provide a concrete instance of this abstract 
information-theoretic principle in action, since the indirect 
connections act to tile the visual cortex with information 
from the entire visual field, retaining maximal contextual 
information. Points in the visual image can discover those 
visual contexts which are predictively related to their own 
activity. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mechanism driving the formation of 
local maps is the Mexican-hat field. It forces contextual 
stimuli which are correlated to be stored next to each 
other due to the excitatory centre. Uncorrelated contextual 
stimuli are stored away from each other, due to the inhibitory 
surround. The structure of the visual field is such that 
spatially contiguous stimuli tend to be correlated. Stimuli 
separated by larger distances in the visual field tend to be 
uncorrelated, whether this be due to the structure of the 
visual scene or the spatially varying properties of the 
retina. The visuotopy of the contextual maps therefore arises 
as a natural consequence of the interaction of the Mexican-
hat field and the structure of the visual field. </P>
