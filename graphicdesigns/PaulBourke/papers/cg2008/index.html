<b>Abstract</b><br>
<dd>
<p align="justify">
This paper explores the use of the online digital world Second Life as an environment in 
which one can represent and explore three dimensional fractals, and in addition, 
present them to others in a collaborative and engaging fashion. Second Life at its core 
provides a means whereby multiple remote participants can engage with 3D geometry 
within a virtual environment. It has been chosen as a likely candidate for this 
exploration for a number of additional reasons, these include the easy to learn 
user interface, its relatively widespread uptake compared to the alternatives, the 
availability of the software for all the major operating systems, its non-aggressive 
social networking foundation, and its scripting capability. The suitability of 
Second Life will be evaluated through examples. These examples will attempt to 
create representations of range of the different types of 3D fractals and a 
discussion of the outcomes will be presented.
