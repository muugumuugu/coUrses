<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) has usually been studied in 2 dimensions as a 
model of fractal growth processes such as river networks, plant branching, frost on 
glass, electro-deposition, lightning, mineral deposits, and coral. Here the basic 
principles are extended into 3 dimensions and used to create, among other things, 
believable models of root systems. An additional innovation is a means of constraining the 
growth of the 3 dimensional DLA by a surface or containing it within a vessel.
