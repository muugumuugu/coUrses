<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Presented here in the form of case study examples are the results from a number of 
practical exercises to explore the state of the art of automatic 3D reconstructions. 
That is, deriving the underlying geometry of an object or place based only upon 
photographs. There is a wide range of applications for this technology; 
traditionally it has been used for landscape/terrain modelling, geology and by the 
mining industry. The interest here is in capturing geometric data in archaeology, 
providing a new data format suited to a richer exploration compared to the more 
traditional photography. Examples of the use of this 3D geometric representation 
include the population of virtual worlds and gaming engines. The manual 
generation of such assets is normally both time consuming and can involve an 
element interpretation on the part of a human modeller.
