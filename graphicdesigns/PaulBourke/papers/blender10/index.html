<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
In the following we will discuss a cost effective immersive 
gaming environment and the implementation in Blender [1], 
an open source game engine. This extends traditional 
approaches to immersive gaming which tend to concentrate 
on multiple flat screens, sometimes surrounding the player, or 
cylindrical [2] displays. In the former there are unnatural gaps 
between each display due to screen framing, in both cases 
they rarely cover the 180 horizontal degree field of view and are 
even less likely to cover the vertical field of view required to fully 
engage the field of view of the human visual system. The 
solution introduced here concentrates on seamless 
hemispherical displays, planetariums in general and the 
iDome [3] as a specific case study. The methodology discussed is 
equally appropriate to other realtime 3D environments that are 
available in source code form or have a suitably powerful 
means of modifying the rendering pipeline.
