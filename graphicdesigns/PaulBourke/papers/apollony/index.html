<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
This paper provides an introduction to the Apollonian fractal, also 
known by some as the curvilinear Sierpinski gasket. This fractal is not 
particularly well known, perhaps because it is not as straightforward to 
construct as many other fractals such as the related Sierpinski 
gasket or the Menger sponge. The brief history and a general description 
of the fractal will be given, including the geometric construction in 
two dimensions and an IFS (Iterated Function System) formulation.
