<b>Abstract</b><br>
<p align="justify">
An experiment was performed in 1982 by the Auckland University Physics Department
to investigate underwater acoustic propagation in a shallow water environment. The
ocean channel was excited using a low frequency acoustic source and the pressure field
in the water was measured by a vertical array of six hydrophones.<br>
A stepped frequency modulated chirp was used as the source signal allowing measurements
of the frequency response of the acoustic channel over a frequency range from
30Hz to 300Hz. The response of the water channel at each hydrophone depth to a pulse
can therefore be determined and comparisons made with that predicted by mode theory.<br>
Ray modelling is successfully applied at close ranges to determine the source-receiver
range and the water depth. Estimates are also made of the sound speed in the
bottom layer.
