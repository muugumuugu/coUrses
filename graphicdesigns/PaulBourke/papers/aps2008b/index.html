<p align="justify">
On May the 9th, attendees of the APS 2008 conference who are interested
are invited to attend a session on upright domes. These are hemispherical
domes oriented at 90 degrees to the traditional planetarium dome and while
not always suitable for astronomy, they are better suited to other
immersive applications. This workshop will demonstrate the projection
technology, present examples of applications of how it is being used for visualisation,
demonstrate examples of navigable movies, and discuss content
creation issues. It is expected to be a very informal session, attendees
are welcome to ask questions and steer the discussion in 
directions that are of interest to them.
