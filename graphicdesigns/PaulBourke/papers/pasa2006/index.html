<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
We present a new, 3-dimensional (3d) plotting library with advanced features, and support 
for standard and enhanced display devices. The library - S2PLOT - is written in C and can be used 
by C, C++ and FORTRAN programs on GNU/Linux and Apple/OSX systems. With a PGPLOT- 
inspired interface, S2PLOT provides astronomers with elegant techniques for displaying and exploring 
3d data sets directly from their program code, and the potential to use stereoscopic and dome display 
devices. The S2PLOT architecture supports dynamic geometry and can be used to plot time-evolving 
data sets, such as might be produced by simulation codes. In this paper, we introduce S2PLOT to 
the astronomical community, describe its potential applications, and present some example uses of the 
library.
