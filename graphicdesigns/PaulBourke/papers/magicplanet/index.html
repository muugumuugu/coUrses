Whenever data that is not topologically planar is presented on a flat display surface, distortions occur which can affect the interpretation of the data. We are most familiar with this when viewing the Earth on a flat display, in the most common equirectangular projection areas are increasingly distorted towards the poles.

The Magic Planet display is an example of a technology specifically designed to present spherical datasets in an undistorted fashion. This seminar will present examples of content on the display, discuss the technology, and how one goes about creating content. It will be of interest to those creating data most naturally represented on a spherical surface, for visualisation purposes in addition to public outreach and education.The Magic Planet display is an example of a technology specifically designed to present spherical datasets in an undistorted fashion.
