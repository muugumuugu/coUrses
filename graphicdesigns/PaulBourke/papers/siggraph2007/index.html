<h1>Novel Projection Environments</h1>
<h3>SIGGRAPH Perth</h3>
Presented by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
February 2007

<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Paul Bourke will present and discuss a number of the more unusual
projection environments he has either developed or been involved with.
This will include VROOM (the Virtual ROOM) at the Melbourne Museum, a
360 degree stereoscopic cylinder at iCinema in Sydney, planetarium
domes including a buckyball dome at GinGin, and some smaller more
personal immersive environments. Applications of such environments
include visualisation, engaging spaces for education, entertainment,
and gaming. Some discussion will also be given to what application or
game developers need to do in order to create content for such
environments.
