Presentation by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
April 2016

<p align="justify">
I will present on DomeLab, a true 4K transportable dome that is the result of an ARC grant and a collaboration between 15 investigators from 11 organisations whose pioneering research is at the forefront of new media art, new museumology and digital humanities.
Two aspects of DomeLab will be covered, the first is as an experimental fulldome system and the two exhibitions that occurred at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016. The second is its life in a new medical research focused facility at the University of New South Wales, specifically EPICentre (Enhanced Perception and Interaction Centre).
