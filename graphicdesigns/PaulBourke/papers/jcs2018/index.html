<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Freeman's pioneering work -- and neurodynamics in general -- has largely ignored specification of an 
anatomical framework within which features of coherent objects are represented, 
associated, deleted, and manipulated in computations. Recent theoretical work suggests such a 
framework can emerge during embryogenesis by selection of neuron ensembles and synaptic 
connections that maximize the magnitude of synchrony while approaching ultra-small-world 
connectivity. The emergent structures correspond to those of both columnar and 
non-columnar cortex. With initial connections thus organized, spatio-temporal information in 
sensory inputs can generate systematic and specific patterns of synchronous oscillation, with 
consequent synaptic storage. The theoretical assemblies of connections resemble 
experimentally observed 'lego sets', while facilitation and interference among 
synchronous patterns, particularly when executed by fast synapses under metabolic 
entanglement, imply powerful parallel computation.
