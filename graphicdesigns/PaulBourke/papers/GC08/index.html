<b>Abstract</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Recent advances in the use of imaging techniques like digital photogrammetry, 
synchrotron analysis and X-ray tomography provide exciting opportunities to view, 
analyse and present high resolution geological and mineralogical data in three 
dimensions. In this paper we present examples of outcrop scale and micro-scale 
datasets and outline current and future applications in rock mechanics, petroleum 
geology, hydro-geology, structural geology and mineralogical microanalysis.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the first example we present an automatic technique to detect anisotropic 
features on rock surfaces. Surface roughness is an important rock property, which is 
measured for structural geology and engineering purposes. The analysis method has been 
applied to synthetic surfaces, and to digitally mapped point clouds of natural rock 
surfaces shaped by weathering, fault wear, and mining.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the second example we present an algorithm to generate discontinuity density 
maps from 3D surface models generated by digital photogrammetry methods. Our 
method is an extension of the one-dimensional scan-line approach to quantify 
discontinuities in rock outcrops and has the advantage to take into account a 
larger amount of spatial data than conventional manual measurement methods. This 
methodology has potential for application in rock mass characterization, 
structural and tectonic studies, the formation of hydrothermal mineral 
deposits, oil and gas migration, and hydro-geology.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In a third example we show how 3D material distributions within a rock 
sample can be visualized in datasets acquired by X-ray tomography and synchrotron 
analysis. We show examples from hydrothermal ore deposits, hydrocarbon reservoirs and 
seals, and present means of calculating and visualizing object shape orientation.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Our analysis methods represent steps towards developing a tool-kit to automatically 
detect and interpret spatial rock characteristics, by taking advantage of the large 
amount of data that can be collected by photogrammetric and micro-analytical methods.
