<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Sidestepping is a context specific perceptual-motor skill commonly performed in 
team sports to evade opponent (s), but has never been investigated in conditions 
resembling game situations. This study examined selected trunk and lower body kinematics, 
kinetics, and muscle activation of high-level (HL) and low-level (LL) soccer players, during 
sidestepping to evade projected, three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic defender (s). These 
comparisons were made with traditionally used two-dimensional planned and unplanned ...
