<b>Abstract</b><p>

<p align="justify">
For some years planetariums internationally have been supplementing, and in some 
cases replacing, their traditional dedicated star projectors with digital projection 
systems. The user experience in a digital planetarium can be very different to 
traditional cinema, in particular, the frame around the screen has been removed. 
This filling of the viewers visual field of view leads to enhanced immersion and 
a sense of "being there".

<p align="justify">
Content developers of digital fulldome often struggle to come to grips with the 
technology, the limitations, and the new opportunities, or they end up re-inventing 
what others before them have already learnt. This presentation will cover all 
aspects of fulldome technology, from the projection systems, to the computer 
graphics techniques, photography and filming, and an insight into what works 
and what doesn't. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Don't miss this unique opportunity to learn about this exciting new medium from 
a presenter who has been working on digital fulldome for almost 10 years. This 
presentation will be of interest to a wide range of potential fulldome developers, 
including artists, educators, animators, film and photographers. After the 
formal material, the presenter is happy to discuss any fulldome related topics 
with the attendees.
