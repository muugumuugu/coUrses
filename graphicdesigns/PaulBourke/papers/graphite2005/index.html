<b>Abstract</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Planetariums and smaller personal domes can provide an immersive environment for 
science education, virtual reality, and entertainment. Digital projection 
into domes, called "full dome projection" in the industry, can be a technically 
challenging and expensive exercise, particularly so for installations with 
modest budgets. An alternative full dome digital projection system is presented 
based upon a single projector and a spherical mirror to scatter the light onto the 
dome surface. The approach offers many advantages over the fisheye lens 
alternatives, results in a similar quality result, but at a fraction of the cost.
