<b>Abstract</b>

<p align="justify">
Sidestepping in response to unplanned stimuli is a high-risk maneuver for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Yet, differences in body reorientation strategies between high and low level soccer players prior to sidestepping in response to quasi-game realistic versus non game realistic stimuli, remain unknown. Fifteen high-level (semi-professional) and fifteen low-level (amateur) soccer players responded to a quasi game-realistic one-defender scenario (1DS) and two defender scenario (2DS), and non game-realistic arrow-planned condition (AP) and arrow-unplanned condition (AUNP). The AP, 1DS, 2DS to AUNP represented increasing time constraints to sidestep. Selected biomechanics from the penultimate step to foot-off were assessed using a mixed-model (stimuli x skill) ANOVA (p < 0.05). Step length decreased in the defender scenarios compared with the arrow conditions. Support foot placement increased laterally, away from mid-pelvis, with increasing temporal constraints. Greater trunk lateral flexion in the 1DS, 2DS and AUNP has been associated with ACL injury onsets. Higher-level players pushed off closer to their pelvic midline at initial foot contact in the 2DS especially. Higher-level perception of game-realistic visual information could have contributed to this safer neuromuscular strategy that, when understood better, could potentially be trained in lower-level players to reduce ACL injury risk associated with dangerous sidestepping postures.
