<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Paul Bourke will present some of the current technologies that were initially developed to solve visualisation problems in other disciplines but are now being employed in the humanities. The presentation will be project focussed and will cover both the data capture and the presentation aspects of the projects presented. Capture techniques will include ultra high resolution digital imaging in archaeology, 3D reconstruction from photography for the recording of heritage objects and 360 degree video capture in cultural heritage.
