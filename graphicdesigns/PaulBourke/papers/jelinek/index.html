<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Automated image processing aids in classification of biological
images. Fractal analysis has been used to characterize natural objects based on
the assumption that these objects represent monofractals. However, many
natural structures such as neurons may not belong to this category. The
multifractal spectrum may mitigate this difficulty, provided that the question
whether neurons are multifractal is satisfactorily answered. Here we report the
outcome of applying three methods that elucidate the variation within 16 rat
retinal ganglion cells as an example of a neurons using the local connected
fractal dimension (LCFD), mass-radius (MR) and maximum likelihood
multifractal (MLMF) analyses. Our results based on LCFD indicate that the
neurons studied are possibly multifractal. However utilizing the MR method
provided inconclusive results due to the finite size of the cells and the density
variation throughout their structure. This has been addressed by utilizing a
novel unbiased method - the MLMF method.
