<h1>Content Creation for Dome Displays.<br>Part 2 - Technology Workshop</h1>
<a href="../index.html">P.D. Bourke</a><br>
Curtin HIVE (Hub for Immersive Visualisation and eResearch), August 2014

This workshop is a follow-up to the one hour Content Creation seminar run by Paul Bourke at the HIVE in June.  Dome displays have unique characteristics that provide a very immersive experience, however a unique display also requires unique content development techniques.  This three hour workshop will provide in-depth guidance on the actual process of developing content for dome displays.  Content types include 360 panoramas, 360 videos, and virtual environments.  The HIVE and iVEC have a range of content capture equipment available to allow you to capture compelling dome content.  Dome displays are also becoming more widely available.  The workshop will provide specific step-by-step guidance on how you can turn your imagination into a dome experience.

In the afternoon we will also offer an optional opportunity to capture some content suitable for displaying on dome displays, and time for extended Q&A on dome content capture, and perhaps discussion of content production ideas.
</p>
A preliminary outline of the workshop content is as follows:
Morning<br>
Overview of four dome content technologies
<ul>
<li>360 degree (still) panoramas using a Canon 5D and fisheye lens
<li>Fisheye movies using the Red Scarlet
<li>360 movies using the LadyBug-5
<li>Interactive environments using Unity 3D
</ul>
Worked examples of the processing pipeline for each of the above
</ul>
<p>

Afternoon - Optional: Content Capture Hands-on Session and extended Q&A
<ul>
<li>Informal discussion Q&A
<li>hands-on with equipment
<li>opportunity to capture and process content using the above hardware
<li>more in-depth exploration depending on interest
</ul>
