Researchers in this room most commonly generate so called volumetric datasets.
These need to be visualised (preferably in real-time) and often the visualisation
integrated with derived statistics and analysis. In this talk I will present some of
the more unusual visualisation options being explored at UWA, these include
rapid prototyping, crystal engraving, holograms, and the immersive iDome.

<p align="justify">
At the end of the meeting attendees are invited to visit the WASP for a first
hand demonstration of the techniques discussed.
