<b>Abstract</b><br>
<dd>
<p align="justify">
Visualisation, as the name might suggest, tends to concentrate on our visual 
system. Typically datasets are turned into 3D geometric entities, rendered to 
form 2D projections, and then presented to our eyes using digital monitors or 
projectors. The goal of the exercise is to improve or speed up our 
understanding of the underlying processes being studied. We do however have 
other senses that may be able to be exploited in the visualisation process, in 
particular, our sense of touch is regularly used to explore our physical 
world. This presentation will discuss the automatic creation real solid 
models from data which can then be explored simultaneously with our sense of 
vision and touch. Practical examples and applications will be demonstrated 
based upon the model creation hardware available at UWA.
