<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Presented here is a case for a higher level of engagement and immersion in gaming by 
proposing gaming software support for displays that engage the players peripheral vision. 
It is widely accepted that the sense of "being there" or "presence" is heightened by 
"removing the frame", that is, filling the viewers field of view with a 
virtual environment [1]. Except for a few special cases this is almost 
entirely unsupported in current commodity games, and yet the importance is readily 
accepted as is illustrated by the widespread use in commercial simulators and virtual 
reality environments. This paper will present the general requirements necessary to 
support a range of seamless immersive displays, that is, displays that engage a 
significant portion, if not all, of the users field of view. It will further outline a 
software pipeline split into two parts, a generic section that generates the necessary 
visual information followed by a section that handles the device/display specific details.
