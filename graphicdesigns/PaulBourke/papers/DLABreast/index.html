Background. The ‘sick lobe’ hypothesis emphasizes a lobar dimension in breast 
intraepithelial neoplasia. Separate parenchymal lobes differ greatly in size, but it is 
not known whether this variation is random, or deterministic. ‘Virtual lobes’ were grown 
‘in silico’ to explore size variation in a model of breast lobe growth. Methods. The 
virtual lobes were grown inside an ‘envelope’ bounded by a 3D breast surface scan and a 
plane representing the chest wall. 3D diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) used seed points 
representing lobar anlagen of the breast bud with visualisation in POV-Ray. Results. 
Branching lobe-like structures were created, with striking similarities and differences 
from real breast structure. Highly variable lobe size mirrored the in vivo situation, but
long unbranched central ducts, which occur in human breast, did not appear. Conclusions.
Highly variable lobe size emerges readily in a random model of breast lobe growth. It is 
certainly possible, therefore, that variable lobe volume in human breasts could arise by 
stochastic processes. However, differences between virtual and real lobe branching 
emphasize that DLA modelling over- simplifies actual human breast growth, and lobe-size 
determining events such (hypothetical) growth promoting mutations prior to thelarche are 
not excluded.
