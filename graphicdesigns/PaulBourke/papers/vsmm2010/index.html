<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
The following will discuss the photographic capture of omni-directional stereoscopic 
spherical projections, that is, a means of creating stereoscopic spherical projections 
that can be experienced by a single viewer without the need for head tracking or by a 
larger audience all of whom may be looking in different directions. We will illustrate a 
means of photographically capturing such stereoscopic image pairs using a single 
camera and fisheye lens. The principles behind this technique have previously been 
applied to computer generated stereoscopic spherical projections [1], a simpler situation 
due to the greater flexibility of virtual cameras. Applications of these omni-directional 
stereoscopic spherical projections include general virtual reality environments, the 
increasing number of stereo capable digital planetariums, and a personal hemispherical 
immersive projection system known as the iDome [2].
