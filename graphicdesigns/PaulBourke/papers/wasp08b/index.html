<b>Abstract</b><br>
<dd>
<p align="justify">
This seminar explores the potential of using the online digital world
Second Life as a scientific visualisation tool, in particular, for remote
collaborative exploration of scientific datasets. Second Life at its core
provides a means whereby multiple remote participants can engage with 3D
geometry within a virtual environment. It has been chosen for this evaluation
for a number of reasons, these include the easy to learn user interface, its
relatively widespread uptake, the availability of the player on the three main
computer platforms, its non-aggressive social networking foundation, and the
scripting capability. This paper will outline the desirable characteristics
expected of any online collaborative tool in science research and will
discuss, through examples, the extent to which Second Life meets those expectations.
