<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Fractal images have for many years been a rich source of exploration by 
those in computer science who also have an interest in graphics. They often 
served as a way of testing the performance of new computing hardware and to 
explore the capabilities of emerging display technologies. While there have 
been forays by some into 3D geometric fractals, the 3D equivalents of the 
Mandelbrot set have been largely ignored. This is largely due to the lack 
of suitable tools for rendering these sets except perhaps as isosurfaces, 
a rather unsatisfactory and limited representation. The following will 
illustrate the application of GPU based raycasting, a now relatively 
standard approach to volume rendering, to the representation of volumetric 
fractals. Leveraging existing software that has been designed for general 
volume visualisation allows the interested 3D fractal explorer to focus 
on the mathematical generation of the volume data rather than reinventing 
the entire volume rendering pipeline.
