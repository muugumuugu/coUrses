<b>Abstract</b>:<br>
As neuron precursors divide and generate action potentials, they 
concurrently undergo apoptosis. We propose that the ensemble on neurons 
competitively selected is that which generates the maximum synchrony of action
potentials. Consequently, local intracortical neurons and patchy connections emerge 
in “ultra-small” world configurations, forming clearly defined macrocolumns and 
patch connections in hexagonal array, where patch connections have relatively 
long axons, and less defined structures elsewhere in the cortex. Extension of 
the competitive principle to local synaptic level explains ante-natal organisation 
of response properties in primary visual cortex, including effects of stimulus 
orientation, angle relative to motion, length, and speed on apparent orientation 
preference. Post-natal Hebbian consolidation of connections leads to the mature 
configuration. By implication, superimposed spatio-temporal images, rather than 
categorical feature responses, form the substrate of cortical information processing.
