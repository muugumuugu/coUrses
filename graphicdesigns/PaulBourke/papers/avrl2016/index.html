<h1>Reality in VR</h1>
<h3>AVRL - Accelerating Augmented & Virtual Reality</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Head mounted displays are one route to immersion, another is through
large scale display systems that completely surround the viewer. While
these systems are in many ways different to the consumer level VR
devices, and they have their own unique challenges, there are also
many similarities. One problem they have in common is how does one
record high quality image and video content.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Paul Bourke has been working with surround visual systems for over 10
years years in both cylindrical and hemispherical display
environments. One of the challenges then, as it is now, is how to
capture 360 stereoscopic imagery and video. Paul will present, by
means of actual projects, some of his work in this area. He will
describe why it is a fundamentally difficult problem and therefore
why, despite a huge appetite for video content, there are not yet any
ideal solutions.
