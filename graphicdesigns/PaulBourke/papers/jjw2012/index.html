<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
A new model is contrasted with standard models of V1 organization. The new model 
proposes that synchronous oscillation and metabolic competition organize the 
configuration of the superficial patch system, and includes an earlier concept - that 
neurons form local connections within macrocolumns in a closed mesh work analogous to a MÃ¶bius strip. 
The new model accounts for the organization of response maps and patchy connections, 
including their tendency toward hexagonal rotational periodicity and the absence of 
patchy connections about orientation preference singularities, and explains interspecies 
variation in their orderliness.
<br>
Simulations of signal transmission provide a critical test of the new model. The simulations reproduce
experimentally observed effects upon V1 neuron responses to visual lines, as a function of the line's 
orientation, direction of movement, speed, and length. Neither selective feature-specific response of
neurons (as in standard models, which are unable to explain the same data) nor selective neuron
responses to particular spatial and temporal frequencies of inputs are assumed.
Further anatomical and physiological tests for the new model are proposed, and the implications for 
information flow in the cortex are briefly considered.
