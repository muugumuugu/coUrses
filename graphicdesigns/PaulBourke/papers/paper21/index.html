<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p align="justify">
Zero-lag synchrony arises between two points on the 
cerebral cortex when these receive concurrent
independent inputs and has generally been ascribed to nonlinear mechanisms.
We report results obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to
simulations of cerebral cortex which exhibit zero-lag synchrony and
realistic spectral content, and show that synchrony can arise
by distinct and separable linear and nonlinear mechanisms.
For lower levels of cortical activation synchrony between the sites of input
can be accounted for by the eigenmodes associated with the wave activity
generated by the inputs. The first spatial eigenmode arises from even
components in the independent input signals and the second spatial
eigenmode arises from odd components in the inputs. Together these 
account for most of the 
signal variance, while the predominance of the first mode over the second
within the near-field of the inputs accounts for  zerolag
synchrony in the neighbourhood of the inputs. 
Thus the
simulated cortical surface acts as a coincidence detector with regard to
concurrent, but uncorrelated, inputs.
Synchronous response in the extended cortical field to changes in
the inputs occurs on a time-scale of a few milliseconds.
</p>
<p align="justify">
At a critical point of increasing
cortical activation,
local damped oscillation in the gamma band undergoes a transition to
highly nonlinear undamped activity at 40 Hz 
dominant frequency.
Such activity ``locks'' between active 
sites to create patterns
of activity with segregated phases.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The complementary character of the synchrony 
dependent on 
damped wave interactions, and that attributable 
to locked nonlinear
oscillations may permit speedy organisation of 
synchronous patterns
and partition of multiple patterns of activity 
within the same
field of neurons.
