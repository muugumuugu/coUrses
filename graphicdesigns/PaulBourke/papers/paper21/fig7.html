<b>Figure 7.</b><br>
 Time taken to separate
the two principal component temporal trajectories calculated for the 
system under two
noise cases described in the text. Plot of magnitude of difference of two
standardised series as a function of time
`- -'.
The point at which the noise input to the two lattices became different
is indicated in
the diagram as a solid vertical line. The dotted `.' vertical line
indicates 30 timesteps after the change in noise input and a second
dotted line is 40 timesteps later. Where the dashed `- -' curve crosses
the solid
horizontal line indicates when the deviation became "large" as defined in text.
