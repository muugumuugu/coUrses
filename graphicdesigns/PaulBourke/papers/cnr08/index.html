<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
A model of self-organization of synapses in the striate cortex is described, 
and its functional implications discussed. Principal assumptions are: (a) Covariance of 
cell firing declines with distance in cortex (b) covariance of stimulus characteristics 
declines with distance in the visual field (c) metabolic rates are approximately uniform 
in all small axonal segments. Under these constraints, Hebbian learning implies the a 
maximally stable synaptic configuration corresponding to anatomically and 
physiologically realistic "local maps", each of macro-columnar size, and each 
organized as Möbius projections of a “global map” of retinotopic form. Convergence to 
the maximally stable configuration is facilitated by the spatio-temporal learning rule. A 
tiling of V1, constructed of approximately mirror-image reflections of each local map 
by its neighbours is formed. The model supplements standard concepts of feed-forward 
visual processing by introducing a new basis for contextual modulation and neural 
network identifications of visual signals, as perturbation of the synaptic configuration 
by rapid stimulus transients. On a long time-scale, synaptic development could 
overwrite the Möbius configuration, while LTP and LTD could mediate synaptic gain 
on intermediate time-scales.
