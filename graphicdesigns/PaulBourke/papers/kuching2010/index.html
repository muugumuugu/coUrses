Digital fulldome projection into hemispherical domes can provide a strong immersive 
sensation to the viewer. In the case of science education, this sensation can be of 
benefit by creating an engaging learning environment. Unfortunately the costs and 
expertise required are often beyond the means of all but the larger educational 
institutions. There are however fulldome projection systems that may not have the 
visual fidelity of the much more expensive versions but never-the-less can 
deliver comparable educational outcomes.

This presentation by Paul Bourke will discuss the use of digital fulldome within the 
University of Western Australia and internationally. This will include how it is 
used to enhance visualisation in science research, provide engaging teaching 
environments, and create novel exhibits for museums and art galleries. The 
session will be informal, lots of real examples will be shown on the dome, and 
attendees are welcome to ask questions.
