<b>Abstract</b>: Scientific visualisation often employs specialist hardware for viewing, 
interacting, and exploring datasets. This hardware, while it may be readily 
available in research institutions, is often expensive, not suited to 
transportation, and may require time consuming installation. As such it is 
often unsuitable for presenting visualisation results in an engaging way to 
peers at remote conferences or for public outreach and education. There are 
many solutions one can imagine to address these limitations, here I will 
discuss three that are perhaps a bit unusual but have nevertheless proven to be 
popular. They are: rapid prototyping to form solid models of data that can 
additionally engage our sense of touch, 3D engraving into blocks of crystal, 
and synthetic holograms. A discussion of the underlying technologies will be 
given along with the respective merits and limitations of each, examples of 
applications of each technology will be available at the workshop.
