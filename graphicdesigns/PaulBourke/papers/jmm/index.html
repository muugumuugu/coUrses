<b>Abstract</b><br>
<dd>
<p align="justify">
As computer performance and graphics hardware continue to improve, the 
gamer is increasingly being presented with richer and more realistic 
visual environments. Viewing these virtual environments is generally 
still based upon display technology that does not exploit two very 
important characteristics of our visual system, namely stereoscopic 
vision that is responsible for the enhanced depth perception we 
see in the real world and a wide field of view that allows us to 
sense activity in our far peripheral vision. In what follows it will be 
argued that for immersive gaming a wide field of view is both 
functionally more useful and places less stress on the visual 
system than stereoscopic viewing. In order to support gaming with a 
wide vertical and horizontal field of view a low cost projection 
system will be introduced and the implications for game developers discussed.
