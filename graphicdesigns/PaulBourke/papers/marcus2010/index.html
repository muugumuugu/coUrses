<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are serious and debilitating, often 
resulting from the performance of evasive sides-stepping (Ssg) by team sport athletes. 
Previous laboratory based investigations of evasive Ssg have used generic visual stimuli 
to simulate realistic time and space constraints that athletes experience in the preparation 
and execution of the manoeuvre. However, the use of unrealistic visual stimuli to impose 
these constraints may not be accurately identifying the relationship between the perceptual 
demands and ACL loading during Ssg in actual game environments. We propose that 
stereoscopically filmed footage featuring sport specific opposing defender/s simulating a 
tackle on the viewer, when used as visual stimuli, could improve the ecological validity of 
laboratory based investigations of evasive Ssg. Due to the need for precision and not just 
the experience of viewing depth in these scenarios, a rigorous filming process built on key 
geometric considerations and equipment development to enable a separation of 6.5 cm 
between two commodity cameras had to be undertaken. Within safety limits, this could 
be an invaluable tool in enabling more accurate investigations of the associations between 
evasive Ssg and ACL injury risk.
