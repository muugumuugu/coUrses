<b>Abstract</b>
<p>
We demonstrate that a combination of two transformations of the visual field
are sufficient to account for the organisation of orientation preference in V1.
Both these transforms are mappings of the hemi-retinal image, and are achieved
by known connectivity in the visual system. The transformations are a global
retinotopic mapping into the supragranular layers and a tiling of the
supragranular layers with multiple local versions of the hemi-retinal image.
The local mapping requires that the lateral connections in laminae 4A and 4B
preserve the visuotopic ordering of the retinal hemi-field. The interaction of
the two mappings accounts for both the local geometry of orientation preference
and its global geometric organisation and for the formation of patchy intrinsic
connections in the supragranular layers. The mappings described allow those
features of the visual field which tend to be spatially contiguous
(orientation, texture, colour, contrast) to be learned by neurons within V1.</p>

<b>1 Introduction</b><p>
<p>
This paper presents a model of the organisation of the mammalian primary
visual cortex. The core proposition is the existence of two, distinct (but
topologically identical) mappings of the visual field into the primary visual
cortex. The first mapping is the classical retinotopic, global projection of
the visual field to V1, and the second is a local mapping visual field inputs,
multiple copies of which tile the supragranular layers of V1. Together these
two mappings define the local-global symmetry (LGS) model of V1. The
interaction between the two mappings supplies non-retinotopic response
properties such as orientation preference, and drives the formation of patchy
connectivity in the supragranular layers. The LGS model of the primary visual
cortex suggests there is a rather direct relationship between globally
represented objects (e.g. an oriented line) and various other response
properties (e.g. orientation preference) which have a local geometry.
<br>
The function of the LGS mapping is to allow each point in the retinotopic image
access to a representation of the entire visual hemi-field. Each retinotopic
point is then able to make associations with points in the visual image whose
activity tends to coincide with that retinotopic point. Any oriented lines
which pass through a particular retinotopic points can become associated with
that retinotopic point.
<br>
Three additional assumptions allow the model to predict the specific
geometrical patterns of response properties for orientation preference. These
assumptions are: that the local input-maps distort the hemi-retinal field so
that polar angles are doubled; orientation responses are limited to a range of
180<sup>o</sup>
 within a particular local map; and, the tiling of the supragranular
layers requires two reflections of the local input map. These assumptions allow
the model to cosmetically reproduce many aspects of the distinct geometry of
orientation preference in the primary visual cortex.

<b>2 Response Property Geometry of V1 </b><p>
<p>
The response properties of V1 are well catalogued. These properties have
been mapped through single-cell studies (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968), metabolic
transport studies (Tootell et al, 1988<u>a</u>; 1988<u>b</u>; 1988<u>c</u>) and
optical imaging of the cortical surface (Blasdel, 1992; Blasdel and Salama,
1986). These studies have shown that V1 exhibits a distinctive tiling of
various response properties (Blasdel, 1992). Swindale (1996) has described a
set of canonical properties which a model of the geometry of the primary visual
cortex should take into account. These properties include the spatial
frequencies and organisation of: ocular dominance bands, cytochrome oxidase
(CO) blobs, singularities and iso-orientation regions. To Swindale's list we
may add: temporal frequency selectivity, patchy intrinsic connectivity and
cortical point spread.<p>
Layer 4C of the macaque primary visual cortex has a strict retinotopic
organisation (Blasdel and Fitzpatrick, 1984; see 
<a href="index.html#fig11">figure 1.1</a>). This layer
receives the vast bulk of inputs from the retina, via the thalamus (Blasdel and
Lund, 1983). In the macaque, each hemi-retina is distorted, through a complex
logarithmic mapping, to an almond shaped mapping in layer 4C of V1 (Tootell et
al, 1988<u>a</u>). This distortion is of fundamental importance to the
functionality of the visual recognition system, allowing computational
simplification for operations such as rotation and scaling in two dimensions
(Schwartz, 1980; Sheridan and Alexander, 1997). Receptive field studies (Hubel
and Wiesel, 1977) reveal an orderly, though less exact retinotopic organisation
in the supragranular layers. Receptive field sizes are also larger in the
supragranular layers.<p>
Neurons in the upper layers of the primary visual cortex are organised into
repeated units, roughly 800 um wide and 600 um high, called hypercolumns (Hubel
and Wiesel, 1968). Each hypercolumn spans an entire range of orientation
tunings and a left and right ocular dominance set. Located along the centres of
ocular dominance bands are cytochrome-oxidase (CO) blobs. The blobs appear to
CO staining because of their higher metabolic activity (Horton and Hubel,
1980), and are responsive to colour, high contrast and low spatial frequencies.
Interblob regions are more selective for low contrast and high spatial
frequencies (Tootell et al, 1988<u>b</u>; Tootell et al, 1988<u>c</u>).<p>
The geometry of orientation preference reveals three predominant features:
singularities, linear zones and saddle regions (Blasdel, 1992; see 
<a href="index.html#fig12">figure 1.2</a>).
Orientation preference changes continuously around points, or singularities.
These roughly circular `pinwheels' traverse 180<sup>o</sup>
 of all possible
orientation preference. Between adjacent singularities, running parallel to the
ocular dominance bands, are regions in which orientation preference changes
slowly and continuously. These regions are called linear zones. Other regions
between singularities show local minima of orientation preference in orthogonal
directions: so-called saddle points. Singularities surrounding saddle-points
form mirror images of each other, through both a vertical reflection line and a
horizontal one. The double reflections have the effect of allowing orientation
selectivity to change continuously between adjacent pinwheels. <p>
Singularities and CO blobs both tend to lie along the centres of ocular
dominance bands (Livingstone and Hubel, 1984; Bartfield and Grinvald, 1992; see
<a href="index.html#fig13">figure 1.3</a>). 
Data from the macaque shows that in up to 15% of cases
singularities and CO blobs coincide, but that the CO blobs tend to lie in
between the singularities, along the axis of the centre of the ocular dominance
band (Bartfield and Grinvald, 1992); although this finding has been questioned
(Crair et al, 1997). In the cat, more systematic data shows a closer
relationship between CO and singularities; the average distance between ocular
dominance centre point and nearest singularity was found to be 138um. It is not
known whether the incidence of CO blob and singularity overlap varies over the
surface of V1, for example, whether it is more prevalent in the foveal
region.<p>
In the cat, ocular dominance bands have a clear oval appearance, rather than
the elongated bands found in the macaque (Crair et al, 1997). This difference
seems to be related to degree of binocularity in the two species. If macaques
have one eye sutured from one week postnatally, the resultant shrinkage in the
representation of the sutured eye results in ocular dominance bands more
closely resembling the ovoid patches in found in the cat (Horton and Hocking,
1997). Interestingly, from the point of view of the LGS model, the shrinking
oval patches perfectly surround individual CO blobs. These various data
together suggest that in both the cat and the macaque, there is a regular
tiling of response properties, the width of an ocular dominance band, with CO
blobs lying at the centre of each tile.<p>

<p>

<b>3 Connectivity of Granular and Supragranular Layers</b>
<p>
Anatomically, the mapping into layer 4C occurs via the Lateral
Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus (Blasdel and Lund, 1983). In layer 4C,
two streams of inputs from the magnocellular and parvicellular layers of the
LGN are recombined to form an orderly retinotopic representation (Blasdel and
Fitzpatrick, 1984). The inputs from the LGN project to layer 4C in discrete
blocks (see <a href="index.html#fig14">figure 1.4</a>). 
Projections from the parvicellular layers of the LGN
form dense terminal boutons in lamina 4C<i>B</i>. The size of these dense
terminating patches is approximately the width of an ocular dominance column,
400 um. The terminating input patches to 4C<i>B</i> 
lie exclusively within one or
other ocular dominance band. Magnocellular inputs project to 4Ca in finer
patches of approximately 100 um.<p>
The supragranular layers receive direct input from 4C, as well as indirect
inputs via the infragranular layers (Lachica et al, 1993; Miller, 1996). In
addition, a large percentage of their inputs arrive via lamina 4A and 4B
(Blasdel et al, 1985). Lamina 4C[beta] projects to the supragranular layers
largely via lamina 4A. Lamina 4A is a major source of inputs to the
supragranular layers, in the form of diffusely spreading axons from 4A spiny
stellates (Blasdel et al, 1985; Yoshioka et al, 1994). Lamina 4B receives most
of its input from 4Ca. These inputs in turn project strongly to the
supragranular layers in narrow foci, directly above each point in 4B. Some
coarse fibres project into the supragranular layers up to a distance of 375 um
(Blasdel, 1985). <p>
Of particular interest for the model presented in this paper are the lateral
projections of lamina 4B spiny stellates within 4B itself. These efferent axons
project laterally up to 4.5 mm in the macaque (Blasdel et al, 1985; see 
<a href="index.html#fig15">figure 1.5</a>). 
A similar pattern of projecting fibres is found in the squirrel monkey
(Rockland and Lund, 1983). The lateral connections show periodic accumulations
of denser terminal fibres every 375-400 um (Blasdel et al, 1985; Rockland and
Lund, 1983). These patches of connections form a radial pattern with a similar
spatial periodicity to the CO blobs (Rockland and Lund, 1983). The fibres
within 4B extend further than any other class of intrinsic fibres within the
primary visual cortex. Only cells within layer 4B send out this class of long
range lateral fibres and, at mid- to long-range distances from the cell body,
all terminating boutons are within 4B itself. Most of the fibres within 4B are
preferentially horizontal, rather than vertical (Rockland and Lund, 1983). <p>
The set of connections within 4B is ideally suited to carry out the mapping,
proposed in this paper, of the retinotopic representation in the granular
layers to a local mapping in the supragranular layers. The chief requirement of
this mapping is that each coarse-grained (~ 400 x 300 um) retinotopic location
in lamina 4C connects to a point in every local map (~ 400 x 300 um) in the
supragranular layers. This mapping occurs through polysynaptic pathways within
lamina 4B. We also propose that lamina 4A might have similar properties,
perhaps showing more clearly outside the foveal region of V1.<p>
Studies using injections of retrograde and antereograde tracer have revealed
underlying regularities in patchy intrinsic connections within the
supragranular layers of V1 (Blasdel et al, 1985;  Malach et al, 1993; Rockland
and Lund, 1983; Bosking et al, 1997). These connections traverse the grey
matter parallel to the cortical surface in the supragranular layers and project
to discrete patches or targets, sometimes several millimetres from the site of
tracer injection. Use of these tracer techniques in conjunction with other
imaging techniques has revealed that patchy connections tend to prefer targets
with the same response properties. This has been shown for orientation
selectivity (see 
<a href="index.html#fig16">figure 1.6</a>) 
and ocular dominance (Malach et al, 1993) and
CO/interblob zones (Yoshioka et al, 1996). The spatial pattern of these patchy
intrinsic connections is therefore closely related to the spatial pattern of
other response-property systems discussed thus far. <p>
Recent work on the postnatal development of area 17 in the Ferret has revealed
that the patchy intrinsic connections form from an initially diffuse set of
random connections in the upper layers (Ruthazer and Stryker, 1996). The
formation of patchy connections occurs before the presence of visual input and
before the appearance of response properties associated with the supragranular
layers, for example orientation selectivity. We therefore assume these
connections reflect some primary transformation of early visual inputs, upon
which later fine tuning of response properties is based. This paper describes
two mappings of visual inputs through the granular and supragranular layers,
and how the interaction of the two mappings drives the formation of patchy
intrinsic connections in the supragranular layers.<p>
It has recently been shown, in the primary visual cortex of the tree shrew,
that the patchy intrinsic connections are not perfectly radial, but form an
elongated pattern (Bosking et al, 1997; see 
<a href="index.html#fig17">figure 1.7</a>). The axis of elongation
corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. In other words,
if tracer is injected into a site in the supragranular layers with a preferred
orientation of theta, the pattern of patchy intrinsic connections
overlies a global, retinotopic representation of a line passing through that
point and having an orientation theta. <p>
<p>

<b>4 Local-Global Symmetry mapping</b>
<p>
Alexander et al (1997) have noted strong analogies between the global
properties of the hemi-retinal image and the response properties in the
supragranular layers. These are given in 
<a href="table1.html">table 1</a>. In particular, we assume
these analogies with the hemi-retinal image apply to a geometrical unit in the
supragranular layers corresponding to 1/4 of a hypercolumn. Such a unit
includes one CO blob and one singularity and has the approximate dimensions in
the macaque of 400 um x 300 um (Blasdel, 1992).<p>
The present model of V1 introduces a few simplifications into the visual
system, and will not explicitly deal with ocular dominance, the cortical
magnification factor, temporal frequency, contrast and colour selectivity. The
resulting simplified model focuses on the development of orientation
selectivity, and aims to explain data from mammals such as the macaque, the
tree shrew and the ferret. A more complete model is in development.<p>
Global Mapping: The global retinotopic input-mapping from the
hemi-retinal image to the granular layers (in particular layer 4C) can be
approximated by the function of a complex variable supplied by Schwartz
(1980):<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>

and a and [beta] take the values 0.333 and 6.66 respectively. This function has
a close fit to the mapping found in the macaque primary visual cortex
(Schwartz, 1983). The mapping described by equation 1 is illustrated in 
<a href="index.html#fig2">figure 2</a>. 
A semi-circle on the complex plane, z, is mapped to an almond shape
on the complex plane, G (z). Since the mapping into the granular
layers is variable across species, to approximate the mapping into the granular
layers we could equally choose<p>

or<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation4.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>4</td></tr></table><p>

where a &lt;= 1. In the case of the tree shrew, the retinotopic input-mapping
into the granular layer involves little distortion of the hemi-retinal image
(Bosking et al, 1997) and so could be approximated by an identity mapping. The
LGS model does not depend on the exact mapping chosen for the granular layers.
The retinotopic representation of lamina 4C reaches the supragranular layers
through direct connections and through interlaminar loops via the infragranular
layers. <p>
This description of the global mapping is in terms of a manifold (i.e.
continuous planar geometry with reals as coordinates), but the input map can be
better approximated using a discretized planar map. The LGS model requires that
the influence of the retinotopic representation on the supragranular layers is
at a rather coarse resolution, similar to the blocks of inputs arriving in
layer 4C. We therefore assume that a `pixel' of retinotopic input to the
supragranular layers, ~ 400 x 300 um, serves to drive the formation of local
maps, of the same dimensions, in the supragranular layers. This discrete
version of the model is made explicit in the implementation section to
follow.<p>
A further approximation in the description of the global mapping concerns the
exactness of visuotopy in the supragranular layers. Receptive field mapping has
shown that the retinotopic receptive field structure of the supragranular
layers is not as exact at that in lamina 4C. This fits with anatomical data
suggesting somewhat diffuse inputs into the supragranular layers and larger
receptive fields for the upper layers (Blasdel and Fitzpatrick, 1984). For the
sake of simplification, in this description of the LGS model of V1, we have
assumed that the retinotopic input-mapping between lamina 4C and the
supragranular layers preserves perfectly the retinotopic relations. <p>
Local Mapping: A second stream of inputs reaches the supragranular
layers via laminae 4C then 4A and 4B. For simplicity of expression, we describe
the local input-mapping to the supragranular layers in terms of the
hemi-retinal visual field, rather than the representations described in
equations 1-4. We assume the local input-mapping to the supragranular layers
can be approximated by the mapping of a complex variable<p>

This mapping may also be expressed as<p>

<center><img src="equation7.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>7</td></tr></table><p>

where mu is a scaling factor which shrinks the size of the map
(M &gt;&gt; 1). This mapping has the effect of mapping a semi-circle to
a full circle. In the case of n=0, it maps equally spaced lines of
iso-eccentricity to radii that increase as a square of the eccentricity. If
n=1, equally spaced lines of iso-eccentricity are preserved. If
n=1.5, the pattern described for n=0 is reversed. The mapping
described in equation 5 is illustrated in 
<a href="index.html#fig3">figure 3</a>. A set of rays--of angles
spanning 180<sup>o</sup>--converging 
on the fovea, is mapped by this function to a
circular pinwheel. Multiple copies of this input-mapping tile the supragranular
layers. According to Schwartz (1980) there are approximately 3,000 hypercolumns
in the macaque primary visual cortex. This leads to an estimate of 12,000
tilings of the local mapping described by equation 5.<p>
The most critical feature of the mapping is that it is a local mapping.
It allows each retinotopic point to be associated with a local representation
of the whole visual field. The next most important feature of this mapping is
that it maps a semi-circle to a circle, doubling the angles. This approximates,
in the local mappings, the shape of experimentally imaged singularities. <p>
Anatomically, we propose the local input-mapping described by equations 5-7
occurs through the lateral connections formed by spiny stellates in lamina 4A
and 4B (Rockland and Lund, 1983). These lateral connections recombine the
retinotopic image in a series of steps to form the desired local input-mapping
to the supragranular layers. This is consistent with the observations that 1)
the longest lateral fibres are in 4B, and 2) most fibres within 4B terminate at
great distances within 4B. This anatomy is consistent with the required one to
all mapping. The relevant anatomy is summarised in 
<a href="index.html#fig4">figure 4</a>. The critical
prediction of the LGS model is that the lateral connections in laminae 4A and
4B preserve the topology of the retinal image, while replicating that topology
many-fold over the surface of V1. At present, there is no direct anatomical
evidence that the mapping through layers 4A and 4B is topology preserving,
although this assumption is open to empirical verification or falsification.<p>
Local-Global Symmetrical Geometry: Each point on the supragranular
layers can be defined in terms of a scale-symmetrical coordinate geometry. Each
point is a function of the pair (z<sub>G</sub>,z<sub>L</sub>)
where z<sub>G</sub> specifies, in discrete complex coordinates, which
local input-map the point falls within, where<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation9.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>9</td></tr></table><p>

since the rounded shape of the primary visual cortex means it does not fill the
complex plane of z<sub>G</sub> entirely. The term z<sub>L</sub>
specifies the coordinates of the point within that local input-map. Since this
point is a target neuron, z<sub>L</sub> is also in discrete complex
coordinates. <p>
We express the inverse of the global input-mapping function (e.g. the inverse
of equation 1) as G<sup>-1</sup>(z) and the inverse of the local
input-mapping function (e.g. the inverse of equation 5) as
L<sup>-1</sup>(z). Each point,
(z<sub>G</sub>,z<sub>L</sub>), in the supragranular layer
receives input from two points in the visual field, one through the global
retinotopic input-mapping, point g: <p>

where I<sub>g</sub> is the total afferent input from point g and
I<sub>l</sub> is the total afferent input from point l.<p>
<p>

<b>5 Interaction Between Maps</b>
<p>
The global input-mapping described by equations 1-4 supplies the
visuotopic properties of the supragranular layers. Other response properties of
the local map representations are formed through an interaction of the local
input-maps with the global retinotopic input-mapping into the supragranular
layers. Here we distinguish between the local input-map, supplied by
equations 5-7 and the local representational maps (or local response
property maps) which form as a result of interactions between the input maps,
other cortical anatomy and Hebbian learning driven by visual stimuli.<p>
Representation of Orientation: The response properties of local
representational maps form through hebbian learning mechanisms as a result of
correlated neuronal activity. The LGS mapping allows each coarse-grained (~ 400
x 300 um) retinotopic input into the supragranular layers to become associated
with a local mapping (also ~ 400 x 300 um) of the entire hemi-field. Since
these maps are hypothesised to form only when both sets of inputs (i.e.
I<sub>g</sub> and I<sub>l</sub> in equation 12) are
active, and even adjacent local maps receive different
I<sub>g</sub>'s, each local representational map in the
supragranular layers learns a different set of patterns. <p>
In the general case, each local map in the supragranular layer `sees' a
different set of stimuli. For each I<sub>g</sub>, the supragranular
layer also receives inputs, I<sub>l</sub>, from every point in the
visual hemi-field. Activity from the retinotopic inputs
I<sub>g</sub> reinforces patterns of activity in these local
mappings of the visual field. Only those points in the visual field whose
activity reliably coincides with the point g will form strong
connections within the map driven by I<sub>g</sub>. The local
representation which forms will be a version of the visual field which is
visually relevant to the I<sub>g</sub> supplying retinotopic input
to that local map. <p>
In the case of line orientation preference, each local map `sees' only the
subset of line orientations relevant to that local map. The subset of line
orientations which pass through the hemi-retinal point, g, comprises all
the oriented lines which produce supragranular activity in the local map driven
by that I<sub>g</sub>. The local map, insofar as its response
properties are due to the interaction of I<sub>g</sub> and
I<sub>l</sub>, will therefore learn responses to only the subset of
oriented lines passing through the point g. Each local map learns a
subtly different set of lines orientations, depending on its retinotopic
location. The conjunction of the local mapping of an oriented line, and the
global mapping of the point it passes through, is termed a point/orientation
conjunction. A point/orientation conjunction describes the relevant pattern of
activity, or representation, for line orientation preference. <p>
Consider a line on the retina between the points l<sub>a</sub> and
l<sub>b</sub>, moving at a constant speed towards a point g.
Provided the velocity of the line is the appropriate one for the delays through
laminae 4A and 4B, the signals from the set of points between
l<sub>a</sub> and l<sub>b</sub> will reach the local map at
z<sub>G</sub> at the same time that the signals from g reach
z<sub>G</sub>. Since L(z) is a conformal mapping, each
unique line orientation, theta, of a line l<sub>a</sub> to
l<sub>b</sub> passing over g will form a unique set of
activations, z<sub>La</sub> to z<sub>Lb</sub> within
z<sub>G</sub>. The double mapping has the effect of adding an
orientation label to each `pixel' in the global image of the line. <p>
Formation of Patchy Intrinsic Connections: A critical feature of the
input-mapping given in equations 5-7 is that it simultaneously performs both a
contraction of the layer 4C representation to each local input-map in the
supragranular layers and an expansion of the layer 4C representation so that
any point in the hemi-field becomes spread out over many input-maps in the
upper layer representation. That is, each local input,
I<sub>l</sub>, reaches every version of the local map. This
property leads to an explanation for the formation of patchy intrinsic
connections in the supragranular layers.<p>
We assume that the transform described in equations 5-7 occurs from at least
from the time of early post-natal development, that is, prior to earliest
visual experience. We further assume that patchy connections in the upper
layers are formed from an initial random connectivity. These assumptions are
consistent with recent findings on the development of lateral connections in
the ferret primary visual cortex (Ruthazer and Stryker, 1996).<p>
The lateral connections in the supragranular layers are refined through the
detection of correlated activity, between adjacent local maps, in neurons
receiving inputs from both local and global input-maps. This is illustrated in
<a href="index.html#fig5">figure 5</a>. 
A short line is represented in both the global mapping of the
supragranular layers and the local mappings which tile the supragranular
layers. Where activity in the two adjacent local-map representations coincides,
patchy connections form. Connections are assumed to form between any two of
these representations which have correlated activity over time through a simple
hebbian learning mechanism.<p>
The mappings described suggest how the primary visual cortex recognises
oriented lines in different retinotopic locations. The LGS mapping uniquely
identifies any line by position and angle, since for a given orientation, there
is only one line which passes though that retinotopic position. The patchy
intrinsic connections link together the set of point/orientation conjunctions,
each of which individually defines the line. The patchy connectivity therefore
allows a further avenue of disambiguation, possibly adding a binding label
through phase synchronisation of the neuronal activity (Singer, 1993).
Synchronised activity between linked point/orientation conjunctions enhances
response properties to oriented lines, thus generalising the response property
to regions beyond a particular retinotopic location.<p>
In the general case, the model predicts that V1 can learn stimulus features
which are predictable on the basis of spatial contiguity. The interaction, in
the supragranular layers, between a specific retinotopic input,
z<sub>G</sub>, and the local map inputs from the entire visual
hemi-field leads to a unique pattern of activation at that retinotopic point.
Properties such as line orientation, spatial frequency, contrast and colour
tend to be spatial contiguous and so will reliably activate particular patterns
of activity in adjacent local representations. Through this reliable
co-activation, hebbian learning drives the formation of lateral connectivity
between the active sites in these adjacent maps, producing generalised response
properties. <p>
Further Assumptions, Predictions and Limitations: A few additional
assumptions are required to reproduce the geometric pattern of orientation
preference, at the scale of individual singularities, hypercolumns and beyond.
To retrieve the typical singularity shape, of 180<sup>o</sup> of orientation
preference traversing 360<sup>o</sup>
 of a circle, responses to oriented lines of a
local map must favour orientations within a range of approximately 
180<sup>o</sup>.
This is the distortion provided by equation 5. Systematic mapping of direction
preference in the primary visual cortex of the ferret reveals that direction
preference is also most often segregated into local maps with only a 
180<sup>o</sup>
range of direction preference (Weliky et al, 1996).<p>
Imaging of orientation preference shows that adjacent singularities are usually
mirror images of each other. The tiling of multiple singularities shown in
<a href="index.html#fig6">figure 6</a> 
illustrates this mirroring, revealing linear-zones and saddle points.
Reflection of the adjacent tiles has the effect of allowing orientation
preference to change continuously between singularities. It does not alter the
functionality of the LGS mapping, which only relies on a local representation
of the visual hemi-field being mapped to each global retinotopic point. <p>
<a href="index.html#fig7">Figure 7</a> 
illustrates the relationships between CO blobs and singularities
predicted by the LGS model. The model predicts that singularities and CO blobs
should coincide in the region on the global retinotopic map which represents
the centre of the field of vision. This is because the CO blobs are
hypothesised to be the local map representations of the central field of vision
and local-mappings in this region are activated by the set of orientations
passing through the central field of vision. This contrasts to the local-map
representations in the periphery. The set of orientations passing through these
retinotopic locations miss the central field of vision and hence, in their
local map representations, the CO blobs. This may explain the variation in
findings in the literature, regarding the positioning of CO blobs and
singularities (Livingstone and Hubel, 1984; Bartfeld and Grinvald, 1992; Crair
et al, 1997).<p>
A simplification in this analysis of orientation preference has been the nature
of the retinotopic inputs into the supragranular layer-hypothesized to be
connections from 4C<i>B</i> via 4A. In reality these connections are diffuse,
rather than point-like. Local map representations have been described in this
paper as though the representation which forms is that one which is
`predictive' for the global retinotopic location over which it lies. It seems
more likely that local representational maps form through the interaction of
the intracortical loops between the granular, supragranular and infragranular
layers (Miller, 1996). This would provide the model with additional degrees of
freedom for targets of retinotopic inputs to the supragranular layers. Both the
local input-mapping and the global input-mapping would then be subject to
modification through hebbian learning, depending on how well they predict
activity in the loop through the granular and infragranular layers. This
additional complexity suggests a source for the variation found empirically in
local maps; they are rather more `noisy' than the perfect geometry of the LGS
model would suggest.<p>
<p>

<b>6 Implementation of Model</b>
<p>
We now describe an implementation of the model which illustrates the global and
local spatial ordering orientation preference, and its relationship to the
development of intrinsic patchy connections. The aim of the implementation is
not to cosmetically reproduced the exact geometrical features of response
properties found in a particular animal. The additional distortions of the
mappings are therefore not included in these simulations. The simulations show
that orientation preference develops as a function of the two mappings when a
simple network of artificial neurons is trained in an unsupervised fashion with
moving lines as stimuli. The simulation also shows the development of intrinsic
patchy connections which have the same local and global geometry as is found
empirically.<p>
The mappings of the visual field are described in this section in terms of a
discrete hexagonal lattice, named the Spiral Harmonic Mosaic (SHM). The SHM is
a discretized subset of the complex plane. The SHM consists of a hexagonal
lattice, with each hexagon having a designated positive integer address
(Sheridan, 1996). The numbered hexagons form clusters, or super-hexagons, of
size 7<sup>n</sup>; these self-similar super-hexagons tile the plane in a
recursively modular manner (Alexander, 1995). Images can be projected into the
SHM, with each pixel in the image associated spatially with a particular
hexagon and algebraically with its address. An algebraic operation, called
Spiral Multiplication, allows scaling and tiling of an image. For more details,
see Sheridan (1996).<p>
We define mappings from the granular layers to the supragranular layers in
terms of SHM. Here we ignore, for the sake of simplicity, the shape of the
visual field (hemi-retina) and the shape of the retinotopic mapping in layer
4C. Likewise we ignore the geometric distortions of the local mappings, so here
360<sup>o</sup> 
of moving oriented lines will project directly to 360<sup>o</sup> local
maps. The retina, granular layers and supragranular layers are represented in
these simulations as a 7<sup>4</sup> superhexagon. Each hexagon can be
interpreted as roughly the scale of a minicolumn, 30um. Images are projected
onto the granular layer at a resolution of 7<sup>2</sup>, so that each image is
made up of 7<sup>2</sup> `pixels' or discrete retinotopic locations. This
approximates the coarseness of resolution of inputs into the granular layers
from the LGN (Blasdel and Fitzpatrick, 1984). Moving lines are projected onto
the retinal superhexagon, and these lines sweep across the entire retina at a
constant speed of approximately 1/2 pixel per stimulus step; the total time for
one sweep across the model retina taking ~30 time-steps. A random angle of
orientation is chosen for each sweep of the line.<p>
The first mapping, which supplies the global map of retinotopic inputs, is an
identity mapping.<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation13.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>13</td></tr></table><p>

where V<sub>j</sub> and S<sub>j</sub> are SHM integer addresses,
on the simplified granular and supragranular layers, respectively.
w<sub>Gj</sub> is the connection weight, for this global mapping, from
the jth address in the granular layers to the jth address in the
supragranular layer. This global mapping is assumed to occur through the
interlaminar loops of connections which leave layer 4C and project to the
infragranular layers and then back up to the supragranular layers (Miller,
1996). <p>
The second mapping, which supplies a local copy of the entire visual field to
each global retinotopic point, is simply a Spiral Multiplication of the input
image.<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation14.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>14</td></tr></table><p>

where w<sub>Lj</sub> is the connection weight, for this local mapping,
from the jth address in the granular layers to the M jth address
in the supragranular layer and where M is an integer multiplier which
scales the image and tiles multiple copies over the surface of the model
supragranular layers. In these experiments we set M to 49 (100 in base
7) which has the effect of producing 49 smaller images of the visual field,
each taking an area 1/49th of the original image. There is a delay of 1
time-step for these local input-map connections, due to the polysynaptic
pathway for these connections in the real anatomy. The input mapping for local
inputs is assumed to occur through lamina 4A and 4B. In both cases of input
mappings, the SHM transforms are interpreted as direct and indirect
connectivities from one cortical location to another. <p>
A third set of connections are intrinsic to the supragranular layers.
Initially, these connections are from every supragranular hexagon to every
other one:<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation15.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>15</td></tr></table><p>

 w<sub>ij</sub> is the connection weight, for this intrinsic mapping,
from the ith address in the supragranular layers to each of the j
addresses in the supragranular layer. The weight, w<sub>ij</sub>, of
each of these intrinsic connections is initially drawn from a random
distribution (except in the case of i = j, where
w<sub>ij</sub> is permanently set to 0), with the initial sum of
weights, 
<p><center>
<IMG SRC="equation15b.gif">
</center><p>

to each hexagon, j, being 1.<p>
The activation of each hexagon in the supragranular layers is updated in two
steps. First the contribution of the two input mappings to the supragranular
layers is calculated:<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation16.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>16</td></tr></table><p>

where a<sub>Sj</sub> and a<sub>Vj</sub> are the activations of
the jth cells of the supragranular and granular layers, respectively.
The inputs to the supragranular layers are then added to the contribution of
the intrinsic connections:<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation17.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>17</td></tr></table><p>

where A<sub>Sj</sub> is the total activation of the hexagon from all
sources.<p>
The intrinsic patchy connections are modified according to the Hebbian learning
rule:<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation18.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>18</td></tr></table><p>

where <p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation19.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>19</td></tr></table><p>

and [Delta]w is the update increment for the (excitatory) intrinsic
connections. This was set to 0.01. The threshold activation for Hebbian
learning to occur, [Phi], was set to 2. This mean that a hexagon had to receive
inputs from both input mappings, and both pre- and post-synaptically, in order
for learning to take place in the intrinsic connections of the supragranular
layer. The activation of each hexagon was kept to a maximum of 3 by the a
weight scaling function:<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation20.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>20</td></tr></table><p>

and where<p>

<p><table width=100%><tr><td align=center>
<center><img src="equation21.gif"></center>
</td><td align=right>21</td></tr></table><p>

Thus there are three sets of connections: the global input-map; local
input-map, and; intrinsic patchy connections, with each set contributing a
maximum of 1 unit of activation to each hexagon. There were 10,000 simulation
time-steps in total, or ~300 sweeps of oriented line stimuli.<p>
<p>

<b>7 Results</b>
<p>
The activity patterns for two simulation time-steps are shown in 
<a href="index.html#fig8">figure 8</a>. The
figure shows the global mapping of the oriented line, and the multiple local
maps of this same input activity. Points where the two input-mappings overlap
have increased activation due to the strengthening of intrinsic patchy
connections between pairs of these sites. Also shown in 
<a href="index.html#fig8">figure 8</a> is the
orientation preference map. This is produced in a similar manner to empirical
studies with animals. The network is stimulated with a systematic range of
angles, and a vector map of responses is produced. The angle of the summed
vectors is shown as a false colour map. An intrinsic connectivity map is also
shown for one hexagon. This is equivalent to a tracer injection in empirical
studies with animals. The figure shows all connections from a particular
hexagon to all other hexagons to which it has a strong connection .<p>

The figure shows three different results, each of which matches data found in
animals. First, the interaction of the two input-maps results in a map of
orientation preference which reproduces the essential features of orientation
preference in the primary visual cortex. Each global retinotopic location forms
a local map which has a pattern of responses to oriented stimuli. The map
contains spatially ordered orientation response properties for all oriented
lines which pass through that retinotopic point. This reproduces the essential
functional properties of the map of orientation preference shown in 
<a href="index.html#fig12">figure 1.2</a>.
Second, the interaction of the two input-mappings drives the development of
intrinsic patchy connections. The intrinsic connections are strengthened only
between hexagons with similar orientation preferences. Other connections are
reduced to 0 weight by the competitive scaling process. This result reproduces
the finding of orientation specificity for intrinsic patchy connections found
empirically, as illustrated in 
<a href="index.html#fig16">figure 1.6</a>, confirming also that the pattern of
connections can be formed through a simple Hebbian learning mechanism.Third,
the global pattern of these patchy connections overlies the visuotopic
representation of a line which passes through the site of tracer injection and
has on orientation equal to the orientation preference of the site of tracer
injection. This matches data from the Tree Shrew, as illustrated in 
<a href="index.html#fig17">figure 1.7</a><p>
The model suggests very specifically the function of V1. It takes as inputs a
set of active retinotopic locations. By creating a map within a map, points of
high activity serve as feature labels. Information is supplied to later
processing stages that, not only is this retinotopic point active, but it is
active because of a particular line of orientation, theta. Each retinotopic
location learns which other points in the visual field are relevant to its own
activation. Adjacent local maps will tend to learn similar representations, and
so will reinforce each other. Those parts of adjacent local maps which are
reliably coactive are reinforced through the intrinsic patchy connections. <p>
The simulation does not cosmetically reproduce the local geometry of
orientation preference. It also does not deal with other response properties
such as temporal frequency preference. This later simplification is the reason
why the patchy intrinsic connections are elongated rather that true round
patches. The simulation also deals with time in a rather simplistic fashion,
both in terms of neuronal dynamics and connection delays. A more complete model
will allow, for example, intrinsic patchy connections to be predictive of next
immediate inputs; i.e. to anticipate movement of a line.
<p>

<b>8 Conclusions</b>
<p>
This paper relies on three assumptions to explain orientation
selectivity in the primary visual cortex. These are: a global,
topology-preserving mapping from the retina to the supragranular layers via the
laminae 4C and the infragranular layers (uncontroversial); a local,
topology-preserving mapping from the retina to the supragranular layers via
laminae 4C then 4A and 4B; and, the formation of patchy intrinsic connections
and orientation preference response properties through correlated activity in
the two mappings.<p>
Orientation, texture, colour, contrast tend to be spatially contiguous elements
of the visual field. The LGS mapping of visual inputs in V1 allows precisely
these properties of the visual field to be learned as response properties. The
local mapping to the supragranular layers makes the contents of the entire
visual field available for association with each retinotopic location in the
supragranular layer. Patchy intrinsic connections link these response
properties at nearby retinotopic locations, which is possible due to their
spatial contiguity. Further description of the model will treat temporal
frequency preference. Extension of the model to response properties such as
colour selectivity and direction preference follow from the general case in a
straight-forward manner.<p>
The local mappings described by equations 5-7 bears correspondences to the
ice-cube model of Hubel and Wiesel (1977). Both assume the uppers layers are
tiled with a regular map of the feature space. The LGS model has the additional
features that it 1) directly suggests the function of known anatomical
connections, 2) explains how the response properties are created.<p>
The model assumes that the geometry of V1 serves to organise multiple response
properties into two dimensions. It differs from other models of V1 geometry
which, rather than mappings, use simulated annealing or other relaxation
procedures to achieve this dimension reduction (Durbin and Mitchison, 1990;
Swindale, 1992). The latter models have multiple free parameters (Swindale,
1996). By contrast, the LGS model of V1 contains a limited number of
assumptions and no arbitrary parameters.<p>

Anatomy of V1 relevant to the LGS model. Two streams
of inputs reach the supragranular layers. One mapping, via lamina 4C then the
infragranular layers, supplies a global retinotopic mapping. A second stream of
inputs, via 4C then 4A and 4B, supplies a local mapping of the visual
hemi-field. The black circles in lamina 4A and 4B represent the dense patches
of terminating fibres seen empirically.

Schematic representation of the formation of
intrinsic patchy connectivity. A short, oriented line (shown in red) is mapped
according to the LGS model of V1. The left hand column shows the mapping from
hemi-retina to the granular and supragranular layers. Right of figure shows a
magnified section of the line in the supragranular layers and the intersecting
local maps. Each point/orientation conjunction uniquely defines the line by
position and angle. Patchy connectivity forms between pairs of the
point/orientation conjunctions, through a hebbian learning rule (shown by black
arrows).

Tiling of the supragranular layers with multiple
copies of the hemi-retinal image. Adjacent tilings of the local map are
reflected about either a vertically or horizontally oriented axis. The upper
part of the image shows tiling shows linear zones extending vertically, between
columns of singularities. The lower part of the image shows saddle-points
between singularties. The only difference between the two tiling patterns is
that, in the upper portion of the image, every second row is translated in the
horizontal direction by one tiling.

Predicted relationships between singularities
(colour) and CO blobs (grey) at different retinotopic locations. <p>

<b>A</b>. A set of oriented lines which pass through the centre of the
fovea (left) will create a local supragranular map, located in the foveal
region of V1 (right), in which the singularity and CO blob coincide
(middle).<p>

<b>B</b>. A set of oriented lines which miss the fovea (left) will create a
local supragranular map, located in the parafoveal region of V1 (right), in
which the singularity and CO blob do not coincide (middle).<p>

Simulation of orientation preference in the LGS
model. Above: Pattern of activation during two different sti</a>mulus
presentations. Grey areas show the influence of either the local or global
inputs. Red areas indicate activation due to both global and local
input-mappings and the intrinsic patchy connections. Below: False colour map of
orientation preference. Imposed upon this is the set of intrinsic connections
(thin black lines) from hexagon 54 (thick black lines). The patchy connections
project to sites of similar orientation selectivity. The global pattern of
these patchy connections overlies the visuotopic representation of a line which
passes through hexagon 54 and has on orientation equal to the orientation
preference of hexagon 54.
