<h3>Case 9: High resolution dome displays and navigable movies</h3>
<a href="../index.html">Return to index</a><p>

<p align="justify">
Creating suitable imagery for the iDome requires both high resolution movies a
well as a warping process that takes a movie as input and distorts
it in such a way that the results looks correct on the dome. There are two types
of movie input, the first is a movie made up of fisheye images, nothing special
except to fully exploit the resolution of the projectors the fisheye frames 
need to be at least 1600x1600 pixels. Another more interesting input is a 
movie made up of full spherical projectons, while the movie is playing one is
free to nagivate. These navigable movies, in order to make full use of the
available resolution of the projection system need to be 4096 pixels wide by
2048 pixels tall.

<p align="justify">
For more information on navigable movies see
<a href="../../auc2007/index.html">this</a> and for
information on a QuickTime API based player see
<a href="../../../dome/warpplayer/index.html">this</a>.
This is onlt possible due to the tight coupling now between QuickTime and the OpenGL
API, indeed the performance hit to draw the movie frames onto a mesh is negligable.
