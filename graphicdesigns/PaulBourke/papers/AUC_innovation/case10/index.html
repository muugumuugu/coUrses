<h3>Case 10: Cosmology gallery exhibition</h3>
<a href="../index.html">Return to index</a><p>

<p align="justify">
This exhibition is located at the Cosmology Gallery that is part of the Gravitational
Discovery Center near GinGin in West Australia. It comprises of a large gallery space,
20m in diameter and a unique buckball (carbon 60) dome. The proposal was to project
movies (telling the story of cosmology from 5 different religions) onto the dome
and for them to be masked to lie within the 5 pentagonal tiles of the dome.
The solution was 5 Mac Minis, each located adjacent to a data projector.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The intention was to lay minimal cables since the openness of the gallery would make
them noticeable and the cable runs would be extensive (especially for video). As such
the Mac Minis are located next to each projector and a wireless network in supplied
with a AirPort Extreme. A 6th Mac Mini and display allows all the others to be
remotely controlled using an AirPort Extreme based network and screen sharing.
This wireless network also permits synchronised content to be generated, that is,
for there to be a connection between events on each display panel. The audio is
supplied by FM transmitters on each Mac Mini and small tunable receivers attached
to headphones. As such individuals in the gallery can tune into the audio for the
panel display they are watching.
