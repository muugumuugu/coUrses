<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Paul Bourke will present two novel imaging technologies and how they are being applied to recordings in archaeology. The first is high resolution photography, that is, acquiring images many tens of times higher resolution than any single camera can capture. The second is the reconstruction of 3 dimensional geometry solely by taking photographs. These techniques, while familiar in some disciplines, are both becoming more widely used and at the same time the algorithms and resulting quality is improving. A survey of the state of the art will be presented along with examples from archaeology and heritage.
