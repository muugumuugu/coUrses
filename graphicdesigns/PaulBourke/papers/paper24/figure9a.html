<b>Figure 9a</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Comparison of (a) modelled ERPs with (b) experimental ERPs obtained
from normal subjects in response to frequent (background) auditory
tones. The modelled waveforms assumed parameter values all
similar or identical to values used to model the ongoing EEG
power spectrum (fig 8). In addition, it was assumed that a
pulse reached (or was generated within) the cortex at t=0.1
s, and that there was a similar pulse subcortically at about
the same time. The net effect of these two sources is to
reproduce the characteristic biphasic waveform of auditory
background ERPs.
