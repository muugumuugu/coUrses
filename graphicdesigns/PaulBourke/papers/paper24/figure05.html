<b>Figure 5</b><p>

<p align="justify">
        Freeze-frame snapshots of surface electrocortical
potential from a simulation operating at high cortical
activation, under the constraint of powerful, fast, synaptic
feedbacks. Frames are seperated by approximately 10 ms, and
scales are normalised units. The upper, folded, surfaces show
the spatial conformation of local field potentials, with
increasing membrane depolarisation associated with the upward
direction. The shading on this surface is present merely to
enhance the visual form of the contour. The underlying flat
surfaces show concurrent pulse density, and here the darker
shading indicates higher pulse density, associated with
greater mean membrane depolarisation. Other than an
initiating impulse of spatio-temporal white noise, there is
no random driving. The activity is self-sustaining.
