<b>Figure 1</b><p>
<p align="justify">
        The top left panel of figure 1 shows two representative
cells within the cerebral cortex - one red (an excitatory
"pyramidal" cell) and one blue (an inhibitory "stellate"
cell). Populations of these cells are linked together densely
in the cerebral cortex. Top right panel shows the gamma band
local oscillation which emerges when the locale of cells
becomes sufficiently excited.
<p align="justify">
</p>
        The middle panels of figure 1 show how at a larger
scale, these foci of excited cortex generate waves of
cortical electrical activity spreading into the less excited
surrounding cortical tissue (middle left panel). The
resulting wave activity can be analysed by cross-correlation,
as shown in the middle right panel. Here the lag time for
maximally correlated activity (with reference to the
recording site shown in the left middle panel) is displayed
for the extended field. It is seen that the foci of activity
have entered "synchronous oscillation".

<p align="justify">
        The lower panels in figure 1 show the overall brain, and
EEG activity as generated in simulations - from low frequency
"theta" activity, through the alpha, beta and gamma ranges,
to 40Hz. These progressive changes in frequency content
reflect the overall level of cortical excitation. At the
highest levels of excitation, the self-excited cortical state
described in the top panels has been reached.
