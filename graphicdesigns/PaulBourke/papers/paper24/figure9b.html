<b>Figure 9b</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Comparison of (a) modelled ERPs with (b) experimental ERPs
obtained from normal subjects in response to infrequent
(target) auditory tones. The model parameters were identical
to those used in the 9(a). The difference is that the
modelled ERP is the sum of two background ERPs, shifted by
0.1 s relative to each other. The second impulse required to
generate the second of these ERPs we assume to arise from
descending signals from cortex to input pathways, as the
target tone is responded to.
