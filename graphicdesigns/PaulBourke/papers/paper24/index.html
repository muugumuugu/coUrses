<b>Abstract.</b></a>

<P align="justify">
Continuum models of cerebral cortex with parameters derived
from physiological data, provide explanations of the cerebral
rhythms, synchronous oscillation, and autonomous cortical
activity in the gamma frequency range, and suggest possible
mechanisms for dynamic self-organisation in the brain.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Dispersion relations and derivations of power spectral
response for the models, show that a low frequency resonant
mode and associated travelling wave solutions of the models'
equations of state can account for the predominant 1/f
spectral content of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Large
scale activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands, is
accounted for by thalamocortical interaction, under
regulation by diffuse cortical excitation. System impulse
responses can be used to model Event-Related Potentials.
Further classes of local resonance may be generated by rapid
negative feedbacks at active synapses.
</p>

<P align="justify"> 
Activity in the gamma band around 40 Hz, associated with
large amplitude oscillations of pulse density, appears at
higher levels of cortical activation, and is unstable unless
compensated by synaptic feedbacks. Control of cortical
stability by synaptic feedbacks offers a partial account of
the regulation of autonomous activity within the cortex.
</p>

<P align="justify"> 
Synchronous oscillation occurs between concurrently excited
cortical sites, and can be explained by analysis of wave
motion radiating from each of the co-active sites.
</p>

<P align="justify"> 
These models are suitable for the introduction of learning
rules - most notably the coherent infomax rule.

<B>1. Introduction.</b></a>

<P align="justify">
The operation of the brain requires the coordinated interplay
of billions of neurones via their synapto-dendritic
couplings. The development of a concise mathematical
description of this interplay is a major goal of
neuroscience, but attempts to attain this goal encounter
problems of a fundamental nature.
</p>

<P align="justify">
What are the essential cellular properties needed to account
for the local cell pulse characteristics, and the macroscopic
fields (notably the electroencephalogram (EEG)) emitted by
the working brain? How are the observable pulses and fields
related to information processing in the brain? Which are the
essential features of the brain's gross anatomy which need to
be taken into consideration? How do the dynamics of neurones
interact with growth and other plastic modifications, to
enable adaptative learning?
</p>

<P align="justify">
Accounts of interactions within populations of neurones have
generally utilised neural network methods, in which the
elementary units considered are the neurones (eg, Amit et al
1990; Arbib et al 1998; Traub et al 1996; Whittington et al
1995; Lumer et al 1997a,b; Wilson and Bower 1991). Despite
their many virtues, such models are limited by the rapid
increase in their numerical complexity as the scale and
detail of simulation is increased. This complexity also
generally makes them unsuited to mathematical analysis.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This paper describes the current attempts being made by our
group to account for the dynamics of the brain in as simple a
way as possible. We utilise continuum modelling methods
pioneered in the works of Freeman (1975), Wilson and Cowan
(1973), Nunez (1981, 1995) , Lopes da Silva (van Rotterdam et
al 1982 and subsequent), Haken (eg, Jirsa and Haken 1996),
Zhadin (1994) and others. Our work has been guided also by
the following principles:
</p>

<ul>
<li><P align="justify">
We have attempted to fit all simulations and analyses
within a simplified conception of the brain's overall
organisation, with a view to achieving logically compatible
models of brain dynamics at all spatial scales.
</p>

<li><P align="justify">
We assume that at microscopic scale neuronal interactions
are highly nonlinear and discrete, yet at macroscopic scale
observable fields such as the EEG emanate from a stochastic
and essentially linear continuum. (Wright 1990; Wright and
Liley 1996). This means that well established linear
methods can be used to aid analysis of properties often
initially demonstrated by numerical simulations.
</p>

<P align="justify">
<li>Parameters (dendritic time constants, synaptic densities,
etc.) compatible with independent physiological estimates
(eg, Braitenberg and Schuz 1991, Thomson et al 1996,
Thomson1997, Liley and Wright 1994, Rennie et al 2000a) are
used to constrain model fitting to experimental data.
</p>
</ul>

<a name="section2">
<B>2. A simplified concept of brain organisation.</b></a>

<P align="justify">
<a href="index.html#figure1">Figure 1</a> 
shows the basic aspects of the brain's operation we seek to analyse.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Three principal scales of organisation need to be considered.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Firstly, at the microscopic scale in any locale of cortex,
local interactions between a mixed population of excitatory
and inhibitory cells take place. Interactions are largely
mediated by fast neurotransmitters. The existence of synaptic
and dendritic delays, and synapto-dendritic feedbacks, means
that local oscillations of mean dendritic potential and pulse
density are likely in response to any perturbation. The
properties of such local oscillation determine the signal
transfer characteristics and attractor dynamics exhibited by
local neural networks.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Secondly, at a scale from fractions of a millimeter to many
centimeters of cortex, patches of active cells have been
experimentally observed to enter into synchronous oscillation. 
That is, cross-correlations of pulse density, or of mean
local field potential at the separated locii are maximal at
zero lag. This phenomena has been widely, although
controversially, considered to act as a substrate for
association processes in the cortex. (eg, Eckhorn et al 1998;
Singer 1994; Singer and Gray 1995; Stryker 1989; Bressler et
al 1993; Livingston 1996; Miltner et al 1999; Neuenschwander
and Singer 1996; Palm and Wennekers 1997; Steriade et al
1996; Gray and Singer 1989; Gray et al 1989). Such
interactions depend particularly upon excitatory cortico-
cortical fibres of medium to large scale.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Thirdly, at the scale of the whole brain, the total cortical
system interacts with the subcortical systems. These
interactions include reciprocal interactions of thalamus and
cortex, and limbic and cortical projections to the basal
ganglia and elsewhere. These descending pathways ultimately
exert return controls via the reticular arousal system and
related fibres, back upon the cortex (eg Steriade et al 1990;
Alexander et al 1990; Posner and Petersen 1990). By these
means the cortex is capable of self-control of both its mean
level of activity (cortical arousal) and spatial pattern of
activity (an aspect of attention), as indirectly observed
experimentally (eg, Gevins et al 1983; Munk et al 1996; John
et al 1969; Walter et al 1967; Xu et al 1997).
</p>

<a name="section3">
<B>3. State equations</b></a><p>

<P align="justify">
<a href="index.html#figure2">Figure 2</a> 
summarises the elementary physiological properties
considered basic in our recent models, and their mathematical
expression (Robinson et al 1997, 1998a,b; Rennie et al 1999,
2000a; Wright 1999; Wright et al 2000). A field of mixed
excitatory and inhibitory neurones are considered as a
continuum approximating the cortex in two dimensions. The
control parameter for cortical activity is the diffuse
excitation delivered by the reticular formation of the brain stem.
</p>

<P align="justify">
The response of dendritic membranes to synaptic inputs is
nonlinear, because of the influences of reversal potentials,
Rqp. Thus the gross post synaptic potential (PSP size) is a
function of afferent synaptic inputs, modified by reversal
potentials and further synaptic feedback processes, which may
be included in the term H(t). The time course of average
dendritic potentials (the PSP shape, as measured at the
neuronal soma) is modelled by a biexponential function with
fixed time constants, alpha and beta. Mean soma potential, V,
(considered linearly proportional to the population local
field potential) is related to mean efferent pulse rate, Q,
by a sigmoidal function which takes its form from the
distribution of cell action potential thresholds. The
propagation of action potentials in the continuum of
surrounding neurones is expressed as a linear wave equation,
which relates afferent and efferent pulses in time and space,
and a spatial damping term, gamma. Gamma is determined by the
velocity of axonal conduction and the geometry of axonal
projections.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Inhibitory cells we have for the most part considered as
wholly local in their action, with long range cortical
interactions occurring by excitatory connections.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To these basic state equations we have subsequently added
consideration of co-resonance of cortex with the thalamic
system (Robinson et al 2000), and more complex feedback
processes operating at synaptic level, as will be discussed
in later sections.
</p>

<P align="justify">
The basic state equations enable direct calculation of steady
state fixed points for the system, dispersion relations for
the medium, and the power spectrum of local field potential
(EEG) in response to white noise inputs. They also permit
simulation of an extended field of cortex, enabling
inspection of time series and spatial properties of activity
in the medium.
</p>

<a name="section4">
<B>4. Parameters</b></a><p>

<P align="justify">
<a href="index.html#table1">Table 1</a> 
lists the basic parameters of the state equations,
with current values applied in our work. Values for these
parameters have been obtained largely from the work of
Braitenberg and Schuz, Thomson et al, Liley and Wright, and
Rennie et al, cited in the introduction.
</p>

<P align="justify">
There is some sensitivity of emergent system properties, even
with parameter variation within the approximate physiological
range. To aid in melding cellular physiological parameters
with experimental observations on EEG, we have partly relied
upon initial numerical simulations with a nondimensional
model (eg,Wright 1999) and partly upon analytical
explorations of the basic state equations (Robinson et al
1998a; Rennie et al 1999) Parameters have been subsequently
set with some "tuning" within the physiological range, so as
to better fit observed EEG frequencies, etc (Rennie et al
2000a).
</p>

<a name="section5">
<B>5. Microscopic dynamics</b></a>

<P align="justify">
<a href="index.html#figure3">Figure 3</a> 
shows the roots of dispersion relations calculated
from our basic state equations, with the parameter values
listed in 
<a href="index.html#table1">table 1</a> 
(Rennie et al 2000a). Dispersion relations
encapsulate the system's favoured modes of resonance when
driven by white noise inputs, and thus act as an analytic
adjunct to numerical simulations. Resonance occurs at
specific combinations of frequency and wavenumber. Frequency
of resonance (omega) is measured by the horizontal distance
of a root from the origin. Temporal damping is estimated by
the value on the imaginary axis. Shown here are only those
roots which are relatively lightly damped. For each root the
squares show the resonance associated with a wavenumber (k)
of zero, and the tails indicate the root values as wavenumber
increases. The two cases shown are those obtained for
relatively low (10/s) and relatively high (350/s) input pulse
rates of cortical activation delivered by the nonspecific
reticular activation system.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Two relatively lightly damped roots are apparent - a low
frequency resonance at k=0, which is also associated with a
travelling wave system, and a high frequency resonance which
becomes less damped as cortical activation is increased,
until it becomes unstable, as indicated by the root's placement above
the horizontal (real) axis.
</p>

<P align="justify">
These two roots give rise to spectral content of 1/f
character, and activity associated with a sharp spectral peak
in the gamma range (around 40Hz +), respectively.
</p>

<P align="justify">
The occurrence of a potentially unstable root in the gamma
range immediately suggests a basis for autonomous cortical
activity at this frequency range. This is in keeping with the
many experiments on synchronous oscillation cited in 
<a href="index.html#section2">section 2</a>, 
which reveal powerful local pulse and local field
potential oscillations around this frequency, during
processing of inputs.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Obviously, sustained unstable activity as illustrated in
<a href="index.html#figure3">figure 3</a>, 
is unphysiological. For this reason we are
presently modifying the basic state equations to include
negative feedbacks at synaptic junctions. 
<a href="index.html#table2">Table 2</a> lists some
of the more prominent of the factors known to modify synaptic
neurotransmission. Of particular importance in this context
are the fast feedbacks, operating in the 1-5 ms time range.
These complement the fast negative feedback actions induced
by membrane reversal potentials. Probably the dominant fast
effect of this type arises from the post-synaptic activation
and deactivation of glutamate receptors (eg, Tones and
Westbrook 1996).
</p>

<P align="justify">
When fast negative feedbacks are introduced to the basic
state equations, two major influences on system dynamics are
apparent.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Firstly, synaptic feedbacks can introduce local resonances.
<a href="index.html#figure4">Figure 4</a> 
shows time series and power spectra associated with
increasing cortical activation in the presence of one kind of
fast inhibitory feedback. Similar patterns of resonance also
arise when strong negative feedback is present at excitatory
synapses. It can be seen that as cortical activation
increases (down <a href="index.html#figure4">figure 4</a>) 
EEG-like activity appears which
exhibits multiple peaks in the power spectrum, progressively
moving to higher frequencies, approximately imitating
activity in the the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. At
sufficiently high cortical activation runaway unstable
activity, in the 40 Hz range, appears. These results were
obtained from our non-dimensional model (Wright 1999). The
values of the parameters in this version have been tuned to
optimise the resemblance to EEG. Although preliminary, these
results serve to show that rapid synaptic feedbacks enhance
local resonances not apparent as lightly damped roots in the
basic state equations. Thus resonances in the EEG range,
including resonances near the frequencies of the great
cerebral rhythms, may arise locally within the cortex, as a
consequence of synaptic feedbacks. As will be discussed in
<a href="index.html#section7">section 7</a> 
the major cerebral rhythms can be quantitatively
well accounted for at macroscopic scale, by cortico-thalamic
mechanisms. There is thus no need to appeal to local cortical
low-frequency resonances, to account for macroscopic EEG in
the sub-gamma range. But co-resonance of microscopic and
macroscopic neuronal fields is an implied mechanism for
interaction between scales, in our models.
</p>

<P align="justify">
Secondly, sufficiently strong negative feedback operating at
excitatory synapses, or positive feedback at inhibitory
synapses, or various combinations, can act as a time-varying
control upon otherwise unstable resonance in the gamma range.
With appropriate choice of the time constants of these
feedbacks, autonomous generation of activity develops, yet
remains locally controlled at pulse rates within the
physiological range.
</p>

<P align="justify">
To illustrate the impact of this feedback control, 
<a href="index.html#figure5">figure 5</a>
shows snapshots from a small scale cortical simulation which
includes first approximations to these strong synaptic
feedbacks. The continuous emergent activity invites
comparison to the dynamics within the gamma range of
spontaneously firing pools of neurones, in which bursting
patterns of action potentials are observed. Chaotic and limit
cycle types of activity may be present within various basins
of attraction, but as of yet little work on their
classification has been undertaken. In contrast, at lower
levels of cortical activation, only point attractors are
present.
</p>

<a name="section6">
<B>6. Synchronous oscillation - mesoscopic interactions at longer range.</b></a>

<P align="justify">
During the development of these simulations it became
apparent that synchronous oscillation, with close analogy to
that observed physiologically appeared as a property of the
simulations without any additional assumptions (Wright
1997a). We have since developed analytical and numerical
treatments of zero-lag cross correlation (Robinson et al
1998a, Chapman et al 2000), and matched the phenomenon we
observe to some physiological results (Wright et al 2000).
The following account of synchronous oscillation applies to
all frequencies, but, as is the case in physiological
experiments, large oscillations in the gamma band, at about
40 Hz, are associated with the largest amplitudes, and occur
when the cortex is excited by higher levels of input.
</p>

<p align="justify">
If two points on the simulated cortical surface are driven by
separate, completely uncorrelated, inputs (or if uncorrelated
autonomous local cortical activity emerges at two seperated
points) then, within a few milliseconds cross-correlated
activity, maximal at zero lag, appears in the neighbourhood
of both active sites. For this effect to occur, the two
points must be relatively strongly coupled, and axonal delay
must be small compared to the rise and fall time of the
dendritic response. The speed of onset depends mainly on the
axonal delay. This effect does not depend upon system
nonlinearity , as is frequently assumed by those familiar
with stochastic resonance in other situations. It is instead
associated with linear wave transmission in the simulated
cortex.
</p>

<P align="justify">
<a href="index.html#figure6">Figure 6</a> 
sums up our current understanding of the mechanism
of synchronous oscillation. In the top frames of 
<a href="index.html#figure6">figure 6</a> it
can be seen how a large field of zero-lag synchrony surrounds
both sites of uncorrelated input. In the middle frames
eigenmode decomposition shows that the first eigenmode of the
wave activity radiating from both driven sites is
predominant, and this eigenmode defines the field of
synchrony. The bottom frames attempt to convey the essence of
the physical process, and can be explained as follows:
</p>

<p align="justify">
The uncorrelated inputs can be decomposed into their even and
odd components ­ roughly, the parts of each driving signal
which are in phase with the other, and those parts of
reversed phase. Wave activity radiates from both sites as
outwardly propagating, dissipative, linear waves, creating a
small local field of "self-synchrony" about each site, by the
summation of signals transmitted by pathways of similar lag.
The travelling waves obey simple superposition rules subject
to dissipation - but interactions of afferent signals at
summing junctions (dendrites) in the surrounding field
dissipate even and odd components in their inputs
selectively. Even components reinforce one another, while odd
components tend to cancel about the signal mean. Thus, in the
field of both driven sites, the activity induced by the even
components in the driving signals dominates, and a field of
zero-lag correlated activity emerges as the first eigenmode
of the wave activity. It can be shown that the magnitude of
this zero-lag correlated field is sensitive to dendritic
delay time, axonal conduction lag between sites, and the
relative strengths of couplings in the field.
</p>

<P align="justify">
<a href="index.html#figure7">Figure 7</a> 
gives an example of how the results produced in
simulation can be made to qualitatively reproduce those seen
in physiological experiments on synchronous oscillation
(Wright et al 2000). Cross-correlation of pulses from a pair
of recording sites is greatest when the stimulus is a single
large bar, next for two smaller bars moving in the same
direction, and least for smaller bars moving in opposite
directions. We believe the match to experimental data might
be rendered quantitatively precise if relative coupling
strengths, coherence within signals in the input pathways,
and strengths of overlying noise, were more closely matched
between simulation and experiment.
</p>

<a name="section7">
<B>7. The macroscopic EEG field.  A thalamo-cortical resonance model.</b></a>

<P align="justify">
When spectral responses of the simulations applied in 
<a href="index.html#figure4">figures 4</a> and 
<a href="index.html#figure5">5</a> are compared to the spectral content of the
macroscopic EEG, the simulations prove to be inadequate with
regard to both relative amplitude and width of spectral
peaks. A purely cortical account ignores the role long
ascribed to thalamic sources in generation of the EEG - to
which other models of the alpha rhythm have been directed -
notably that of van Rotterdam et al (1982). On the other hand
no models attempting to account for the origin of the
cerebral rhythms have been able at the same time to account
for the predominant background 1/f spectral content of EEG
and magnetoencephalogram (Novikov et al 1997).
</p>

<P align="justify">
It turns out that the addition of a simple feedback loop to
the basic state equations, while retaining parameters close
to those listed in 
<a href="index.html#table1">table 1</a>, gives a good account of the
entire macroscopic EEG spectrum over low to high levels of
cortical activation (Robinson et al 2000). The loop time
required is consistent with an interaction between cortex and
a subcortical system (assumed to be the thalamus) with a
synapto-dendritic delay appropriate for 1-2 synapses. The
background 1/f<sup>1</sup> spectral content of EEG at low frequencies,
with a "knee" around 15 Hz above which power decays as 1/f<sup>5</sup>,
is well accounted for by the low frequency root system,
similar to that seen in 
<a href="index.html#figure3">figure 3</a>. 
The thalamocortical
resonance then accounts for the occurrence of spectral peaks
at the alpha, beta, and gamma ranges, as shown in 
<a href="index.html#figure8">figure 8</a>.
These resonances are associated with low wavenumbers and can
be thought of as global resonances, as opposed to the local
resonances associated with fast synaptic feedback described
in <a href="index.html#section5">section 5</a>.
</p>

<P align="justify">
We have found that the spectral progression with increasing
cortical activation is well fitted by this model, for all
experimental data obtained over a wide variety of states of
cortical activation, from sleep to high alerting. These
results will be later reported (Robinson et al, in preparation).
</p>

<P align="justify">
Finally it can be observed that the thalamocortical spectral
model also permits the simulation of the cortical event
related potential (ERP), by treating the ERP as the cortical
impulse response to brief sensory stimuli, with subsequent
modulations imposed by the cortex upon the cortico-thalamic
resonance (Rennie et al 2000b). Examples are shown in 
<a href="index.html#figure9">figure 9</a>. 
These serve to emphasise that a fuller account of cortical
dynamics must take into account interactions of cortex with
subcortical systems, over a multitude of pathways.
</p>

<a name="section8">
<B>8. Some wider implications.</b></a><p>

<P align="justify">
The classes of dynamics seen in our models suggest the
prospect of a future unification of brain dynamic models with
some aspects of computational and information-theoretic
approaches to understanding brain function.
</p>

<i><P align="justify">
* "Edge of chaos" and universal computation, versus locally
autonomous firing and synchronous oscillations in the gamma
range.
</p>
</i>

<P align="justify">
In several controversial papers Langton (1986, 1990) has
drawn upon the work of Wolfram (1984) and von Neumann (1949)
to propose that physical systems undergoing local second-
order phase transitions may include universal computation as
a potential property. Such systems exhibit prolonged
transitional states, and have been termed "edge of chaos".
Langton has suggested the brain may exploit the "edge of
chaos" to achieve cognition, in ways he has not stated in
physiological terms. In conformity with this suggestion,
local phase transitions in the gamma band are implied by our
findings. With these local transitions stabilised in the
large by rapid synaptic feedbacks and/or adiabatic actions of
slower neurotransmitters and polysynaptic cortical-
subcortical interactions, the regulation of cerebral phase
transitions on all spatio-temporal scales is implicit.
</p>

<i>
<P align="justify">
* Cortical dynamics, coherent infomax and storage of
information in cortical networks.
</p>
</i>

<p align="justify">
Kay and Phillips (1997) and Phillips and Singer (1997) have
described a learning rule related to the Hebb principle,
which they believe is physiologically realistic and which
exploits the occurrence in the brain of synchronous
oscillation. Synchrony between separate sites of input in an
abstract passive-filter neural network is imposed by assuming
the existence of hypothetical "Contextual Field" (CF) fibres.
The learning rule operates to maximise the storage in
synaptic connections, of relations among the information
streams introduced at separate "Receptor Field" (RF) sites of
input. This information storage principle they term "coherent
infomax".The physiological validity of the learning rule
seems further confirmed by its application to learning of
connectivity in models of cortical anatomy (Alexander et al
2000) where we have found this rule more efficient than
simpler Hebb formulations in generating realistic visual
cortex connectivities. In these simulations of cortical
connectivity we have shown that the learning rule results in
a mapping of the visual field onto cortex such that the
visual field becomes tiled with small homotypic maps of the
visual field - each tile about the size of a macrocolumn.
This property may explain the way that contextual information
is introduced into local cortical information processing
(Phillips and Singer 1997; Phillips and Pflieger 1999).
</p>

<p align="justify">
Our account of the mechanism of synchronous oscillation
appears to obviate the need for the special assumption of CF
connections giving rise to synchrony. It can be shown that
our model of synchrony can account for the transfer of
information about stimulus properties to synapses distributed
widely in the cortical field (Wright et al 2000). Further, as
indicated in another paper in the Agora Symposium, the 1/f
background activity of the less excited cortex may enable
optimum information transfer among the active cortical sites,
in accord with the coherent infomax requirement that passive-
filter information transfer take place between active RF
sites.
</p>

<P align="justify">
There appears to be no reason why the coherent infomax
principle might not include the extraction of informational
relations among activity patterns in autonomously active
patches of cortex, as well as among discrete external sources
of input. (Wright 1997b).
</p>

<P align="justify">
That is, locally autonomous, "edge of chaos", attractor
dynamics would give rise to an internal type of RF input.
These internal RF inputs, and RF inputs from sensory
pathways, linked into fields of coherent oscillation by the
cortical wave medium would act to store informational
relations between RF's of both internal and external origins.
Applying these considerations to an imaginary organism
interacting with an environment, the coherent infomax rule
would thus allow association of environmental stimuli with
the organism's internally generated cognitive and motor
activity. As the organism¹s motor activity, sensory and
cognitive activity would all bring about rewarding and
punishing reinforcement influences mediated by hard-wired,
survival selected, subcortical systems (eg Olds and
Milner 1954), we may conjecture that adaptive learning could
result. This conjecture depends upon the further assumption
that the reward and punishment systems act to preferentially
select the synaptic storage of information over appropriate
time scales.

<a name="section9">
<B>9. Conclusion</b></a>

<P align="justify">
It appears that a relatively simple set of state equations
with parameter values close to those determined by
independent physiological measurements, accounts for observed
dynamics of cortical neurones at microscopic, mesoscopic and
macroscopic scales. At microscopic level, fast synaptic
feedbacks appear to be crucial to the stability of the
excited cortex. At mesoscopic scale interactions via
dissipative wave transmission between excited cortical areas
create fields of synchrony, and at macroscopic scale low-
frequency resonances and travelling waves generate the 1/f
background spectrum of the cortex. When this intracortical
dynamic is supplemented by resonance between cortex and
thalamus, much of the spectral content of the EEG is
accounted for.
</p>

<P align="justify">
The emerging picture of cerebral dynamic organisation is
different to that envisaged in alternate models - notably
those of Nunez (1981) - and much may be gained by future
experimental comparison of competing formulations. Our models
are testable in a number of ways - for example, we predict
dependence upon brain size, axonal conduction velocity and
dendritic delays, of the "knee" frequency between 1/f and
1/f<sup>5</sup> limbs of the background spectrum.
</p>

<P align="justify">
The present work offers the prospect that dynamical brain
events taking place across a wide range of scales might be
unified within a single account. It also offers the more
remote prospect of unification of dynamics with specific
learning rules. Whether such a unified account is truly
possible should be revealed as progressively greater
anatomical and physiological detail, and more exact
specifications of parameters are included. As indicated in
the text, at the time of writing we are attempting several
lines of development of this kind. These include simulations
with more realistic anisotropic cortical connectivity at
macroscopic and microscopic scales, the simulation of
cortical evoked potentials and the improved specification of
synaptic feedback mechanisms.

Figure 1<br>
        The top left panel of figure 1 shows two representative
cells within the cerebral cortex - one red (an excitatory
"pyramidal" cell) and one blue (an inhibitory "stellate"
cell). Populations of these cells are linked together densely
in the cerebral cortex. Top right panel shows the gamma band
local oscillation which emerges when the locale of cells
becomes sufficiently excited.
<p align="justify">
</p>
        The middle panels of figure 1 show how at a larger
scale, these foci of excited cortex generate waves of
cortical electrical activity spreading into the less excited
surrounding cortical tissue (middle left panel). The
resulting wave activity can be analysed by cross-correlation,
as shown in the middle right panel. Here the lag time for
maximally correlated activity (with reference to the
recording site shown in the left middle panel) is displayed
for the extended field. It is seen that the foci of activity
have entered "synchronous oscillation".
</p>
<p align="justify">
        The lower panels in figure 1 show the overall brain, and
EEG activity as generated in simulations - from low frequency
"theta" activity, through the alpha, beta and gamma ranges,
to 40Hz. These progressive changes in frequency content
reflect the overall level of cortical excitation. At the
highest levels of excitation, the self-excited cortical state
described in the top panels has been reached.
