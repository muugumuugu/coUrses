<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
We describe a model for cortical development that resolves long-standing difficulties of earlier models. 
It is proposed that, during embryonic development, synchronous firing of
neurons and their competition for limited metabolic resources leads to selection of an array of 
neurons with ultra-small-world characteristics. Consequently, in the visual cortex, macrocolumns 
linked by superficial patchy connections emerge in anatomically realistic patterns, with an ante-natal 
arrangement which projects signals from the surrounding cortex onto each macrocolumn in a form 
analogous to the projection of a Euclidean plane onto a Möbius strip. This configuration reproduces 
typical cortical response maps, and simulations of signal flow explain cortical responses to moving lines as 
functions of stimulus velocity, length and orientation. With the introduction of direct visual inputs, 
under the operation of Hebbian learning, development of mature selective response “tuning” to stimuli of 
given orientation, spatial frequency and temporal frequency would then take place, overwriting the earlier 
ante-natal configuration. The model is provisionally extended to hierarchical interactions of the visual 
cortex with higher centres, and a general principle for cortical processing of spatio-temporal images is sketched.
