<b>Introduction</b>
<p align="justify">
3D printing is an exciting technology whereby a digital representation of data is converted into a physical object that can be held and explored in the same way as we normally study physical objects in everyday life. The technology has been around for some time in the engineering disciplines where it is generally referred to as Rapid Prototyping. Developments in more recent time have removed some of the previous limitations, which in turn have created a range of new application areas.

<p align="justify">
This seminar will present how 3D printing may be employed as part of the visualisation process, both as a way of studying datasets as well as conveying a sense of that data in teaching and public outreach. As an attendee of this seminar you will gain an appreciation of the current state of the technology, it's strengths, and limitations.
You will be equipped to judge when 3D printing may be an appropriate means of visualising data, and how to go about creating optimal digital models. You will also see a number of examples of the use of 3D printing from researchers in various diverse fields such as medicine, geology, mathematics and archaeology.
