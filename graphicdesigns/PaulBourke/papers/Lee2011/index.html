<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
A stereoscopic system that projects videos with accurate scale and depth may provide researchers with more realistic stimuli to study visual perception. This paper describes the development of an integrated stereoscopic system (ISS) via the integration of a three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic system, an opto-reflective motion analysis system and a gaze tracker, thereby allowing the investigation of coupled perceptual-motor (PM) skill. A secondary aim was to present pilot data comparing gaze behaviour and movement response collected with the ISS.
