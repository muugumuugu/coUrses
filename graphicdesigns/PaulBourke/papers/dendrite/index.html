Hierarchical assembly of nanoparticles is very important for the development of bottom-up approaches 
in technology. The self-organisation of nanoparticles has been studied extensively and the preparation 
of novel nanostructured material is an emerging topic in the field of advanced materials.[1] The self- 
assembly of nanoparticulate materials strongly depends on inter-particle interactions, particle size 
distribution [2] and particle shape.[3] The process of assembly of nanoparticles can result in different 
patterns such as rings, rods or needles. [4] The different shapes and morphologies of the particle 
assemblies depend on the dipole-dipole and other interactions between individual particles and also on 
the interfacial processes involving the substrate and the nanoparticles. It has been reported that by 
varying the conditions for nanocrystal deposition on substrates, a variety of organised structures can be 
prepared.[3] There are several reports on fractal structures formed by metal particles including one on 
forming fractal silver nanocrystallites by using y-radiation in the presence of solvents.[5] It has been 
proven theoretically that the formation of fractal structures on solid substrates does have some 
dependence on the roughness of the substrate.[6] The theoretical and mathematical basis for the 
formation of fractal structures has been well developed.[7] Recently magnetic Fe3O4 fractal nanocrystals 
have been synthesised by a solvothermal process.[8] Cao et al have also reported the preparation of 
single crystal fractals of magnetic a-Fe2O3 using hydrothermal reactions.[9] Magnetic nanoparticles are 
widely studied for their application in various fields such as information storage,[10] colour imaging,[11] 
bioprocessing [12] and in controlled drug delivery.[13] Therefore, self-organisation of magnetic 
nanostructured materials into fractal structures is a very important aspect of nanotechnology and 
modern materials science.

In this communication, we report for the first time the self-organisation of magnetic Fe3O4 
nanoparticles into fractal dendrite-like structures using porous silicon (PSi) as a substrate. In contrast to 
the recently reported [8] surfactant assisted solvothermal preparation of magnetite fractal nanocrystals, 
our approach is relatively simple and does not require the use of high temperature and pressure or any 
surfactants. Also, all reagents, materials and equipment used in our preparation are readily accessible. 
The magnetite nanoparticles arranged on porous silicon templates were characterised by micro-Raman 
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray 
diffractometry (XRD), Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic measurements (SQUID).
