<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
We propose a model of self-organization of synaptic connections in V1, emphasising 
lateral interactions. Subject to Hebbian learning with decay, evolution of synaptic 
strengths proceeds to a stable state in which all synapses are either saturated, or have 
minimum pre/post-synaptic coincidence. The most stable configuration gives rise to 
anatomically realistic "local maps", each of macro-columnar size, and each 
organised as Möbius projections of retinotopic space. A tiling of V1, constructed of 
approximately mirror-image reflections of each local map by its neighbours is formed, 
accounting for orientation-preference singularities, linear zones and saddle points  - 
with each map linked by connections between sites of common orientation preference. 
Ocular dominance columns are partly explained as a special case of the same process. The 
occurrence of direction preference fractures always in odd numbers around 
singularities is a specific feature explained by the Möbius configuration of the 
local map. Effects of stimulus velocity, orientation relative to direction of 
motion, and extension, upon orientation preference, which are not accounted for by 
spatial filtering, are explained by interactions between the classic receptive 
field and global V1.
