<h1>Models of Electrocortical Activity: Cerebral Rhythms, 
Synchronous Oscillation, and Relations to Cortical Stability</h1>
Agora 1999
</center>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
A family of related models of electrocortical activity 
provide explanations of the origin of the cerebral rhythms, 
synchronous oscillation, and the emergence of spontaneous 
cortical activity. State-equations shown to reproduce generic
properties of electrocortical activity are parametrised 
from physiological data, and modified to include realistic 
anatomical features. In these models, the occurrence of 
resonant phenomena in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and 
gamma bands, depends upon strong and rapid negative 
feedback, particularly at inhibitory synapses. This 
feedback is only partially accounted for by membrane 
reversal potentials. Travelling wave activity is associated 
with highly damped solutions of the system's dispersion 
relations, and thus global resonant modes play little 
part. However, the formulation is compatible with an 
origin of alpha activity from thalamo-cortical resonance. 
With progressive increases in cortical activation, the 
power spectrum of electrocortical activity exhibits 
dominance of activity at progressively higher frequencies. 
At lower levels of cortical activation, associated with 
the theta, alpha, and beta bands, the simulated cortical 
system exhibits a single stable fixed point. Activity in 
the gamma band around 40 Hz, associated with large amplitude
oscillations of pulse density, appears at higher levels 
of cortical activation, and is associated with an unstable 
fixed point. The transition between stable and unstable 
fixed points appears analogous to a thermodynamic phase 
transition, and features of fast and slow neurotransmission 
can be incorporated, to render the system stable in the 
large. Synchronous oscillation appears between co-active 
cortical sites, and does not depend upon non-linear phase 
locking, except at high degrees of cortical activation. 
Instead, synchrony is explained by analysis of the odd 
and even eigenfunctions of wave motion radiating from 
each of the co-active sites. The most complex application 
of this model attempts representation of electrocortical 
activity at the mini-columnar scale, by introducing a 
detailed specification of the inhibitory surrounds and 
patchy intrinsic connectivity of visual cortex. Quantitative
specifications were obtained from a learning-rule model 
for visual cortical development. By this means, it is 
hoped to explore relations between rapid brain dynamics 
and synaptic plasticity of the Hebbian type. Testable 
predictions of this class of models included specific 
relations between 40 Hz and gamma band activity, and the 
slow electrocortical potentials.
