<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will be the worlds largest
radio telescope, it will be at least 50 times more powerful than the current
most powerful radio telescope. It will enable astronomers to see the
formation of the early Universe, including the emergence of the first
stars, galaxies and other structures. While the SKA will not be built
until the 2020 time frame, the Australia SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is
being built now in the outback of Western Australia. In this
presentation the SKA will be introduced, the relationship with the
Australia SKA Pathfinder, and the part iVEC is playing to provide
supercomputing for the project.
Also introduced will be the significant technological
challenges of the project in terms of computing, networking, storage,
and visualisation.
