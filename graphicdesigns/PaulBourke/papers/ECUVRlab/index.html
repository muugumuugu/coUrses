At the meeting this Friday I will briefly present two types of data capture I 
have been performing in the last month, both designed for presentation in VR 
environments. The first is the capture of 3D objects, specifically, sacred 
Buddhist relics from Sri Lanka (and earlier Cambodia). The second is an ultra 
high resolution stereoscopic panorama stills camera, I'll bring the locally 
developed camera rig along (you won't see it anywhere else).
