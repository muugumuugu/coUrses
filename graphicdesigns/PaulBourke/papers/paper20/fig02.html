<b>Figure 2</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Dependency of cross-correlation on signal/noise ratio and
independence from uniform cortical activation in the absence of overlying
noise. Zero-lag cross correlation obtained between the reference site shown
in figure 1, and another site located at the point of mirror-image symmetry,
adjacent to the right hand input site. Mean and SEM of cross-correlations
from 20 1s simulation runs. In addition to the twin sites of asynchronous
noise input to the same driving sites as in figure 1, spatio-temporally
white noise has been input to all other sites in the field. The
noise-to-signal ratio refers to the ratio of rms amplitude of the random
field noise, to that at the twin ``driving'' sites. Results are shown for
two widely different conditions of non-specific cortical activation, as
indicated by the value of parameter 
Q<sub>ns</sub>.
