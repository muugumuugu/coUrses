<b>Figure 4</b><br>
Effects of cortical activation on synchronous oscillation
in the presence of uniform field noise.<p>

<p align="justify"> 
Average power spectra and pulse-cross correlations calculated as for the two
short bars moving in the same direction case, in figure 3a. Here uniform
amplitude spatio-temporally white noise was applied throughout the field,
and both the level of cortical activation (Q<sub>ns</sub>) and the
amplitude of the signals associated with the moving bars 
(Q<sub>s</sub>) were raised concurrently.
