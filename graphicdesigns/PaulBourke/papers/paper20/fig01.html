<b>Figure 1</b><br>
Essential properties of synchronous oscillation.<p>

<p align="justify">
Top figures: A representation of the simulated cortical surface. Open
squares represent the sites of input of uncorrelated white noise. The filled
square is the reference point from which cross-correlations are calculated
with respect to the rest of the field. Top left: maximum positive
cross-correlations. Top right: delay associated with maximum
cross-correlation.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Middle figures: The first and second principal eigenmodes of activity on the
simulated cortical surface, obtained from the same data used to generate the
top figures.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Bottom figures: Schematic ``freeze frame'' images of potentials (or pulse
densities) on the simulated cortical surface seen when the twin inputs are
sine waves, of any single frequency. Bottom left: potentials in the field
when the sine waves are in phase. Bottom right: potentials in the field when
the sine waves are of reverse phase.
