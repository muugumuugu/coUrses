<b>Figure 3d</b><br>

<p align="justify">
Cross-correlations from proximate-pass reference sites
with differing levels of diffuse field noise, for both asynchronous and
synchronous bar conditions. Differences are with respect to the directions
of bar movement shown in the graphs to the left of each difference graph.
The difference produced by direction of movement is zero at zero lag in the
absence of diffuse field noise.
