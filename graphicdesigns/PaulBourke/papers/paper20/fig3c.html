Cross-correlations for the asynchronous bar case, with
diffuse field noise 0.000025, for bars moving in the same and opposite
directions. Reference points at the matrix row at which the oppositely
moving bars pass each other (proximate pass) or in the same columns but
remote from the passing row (remote pass). See text for details. Differences
are between the remote and proximate conditions. The small differences
remain statistically significant.
