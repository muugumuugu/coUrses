<h3>Abstract</h3></a>

<p align="justify">
A lumped continuum model for electrocortical activity was
used to simulate several established experimental findings of synchronous
oscillation which have not all been previously embodied in a single
explanatory model. Moving-bar visual stimuli of different extension, stimuli
moving in different directions, the impact of non-specific cortical
activation upon synchronous oscillation, and the frequency content of EEG
associated with synchrony were considered. The magnitude of zero lag
synchrony was primarily accounted for by the properties of the eigenmodes of
the travelling LFP superposition waves generated by inputs to cortex,
largely independent of the oscillation properties and associated spectral
content. Approximation of the differences in cross correlation observed with
differently moving bar stimuli, and of the impact of cortical activation,
required added assumptions on (a) spatial coherence of afferent volleys
arising from parts of a single stimulus object, and (b) the presence of low
amplitude diffuse field noise, with enhancement of cortical signal/noise
ratio with respect to the spatially coherent inputs, at higher levels of
cortical activation. Synchrony appears to be a ubiquitous property of
cortex-like delay networks. Precision in the modelling of synchronous
oscillation findings will require detailed description of input pathways,
cortical connectivity, cortical stability, and aspects of
cortical/subcortical interactions.
</p>

<a name="introduction">
<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p align="justify">
Discovery of the phenomenon of synchronous oscillation in the cerebral
cortex [eg Eckhorn et al 1988; Gray et al 1989; Singer 1994; Singer and Gray
1995] was partly motivated by a proposal by von der Malsburg [1983] that
patterns of synchronous activity in the brain would offer a mechanism
whereby the many sensory input features contributing to the perception of a
unified object, might be linked to form a whole. This offered a solution to
the binding problem posed by the need to register unique combinations of all
possible stimulus features [Singer and Gray 1995; Livingstone 1996].
</p>

<p align="justify">
As has been pointed out by Palm and Wennekers [1997] interest in this
solution to the binding problem, rather than the simpler requirements of
direct modelling of experimental results has driven much of the attempts to
find an explanatory mechanism for synchronous oscillation. A strong
presumption that linked non-linear oscillations underlie the phenomenon [eg
Abarbanel et al 1996] has motivated most attempts at modelling the
phenomenon. Yet there is little evidence that phase-locking of non-linear
oscillators is necessarily involved [Wennekers and Palm 1997], considering
the broad spectral band over which synchrony has been found [Bressler et al
1993].
</p>

<p align="justify">
The significance of the experimental data now published on synchronous
oscillation is very substantial, but remains controversial. Theoretical
opinions vary from the view that synchrony may be essentially irrelevant to
synaptic interactions [Amit 1998] to the possibility that synchrony is vital
to the co-ordination of synaptic modifications in the brain [Phillips and
Singer 1997]. Experimental conditions leave a number of variables
(connectivities, signal/noise ratios etc.) unspecified. Meantime, attempts
to model the process must be selective. Some experimental aspects of
synchronous oscillation appear reasonably clearly defined.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Firstly, it is known that synchrony is most often observed in association
with oscillation in the gamma band [eg Eckhorn 1988] but not uniquely so
[Bressler et al 1993].
</p>

<p align="justify">
Secondly, it appears that synchrony is strongest between cortical sites in
which neurones seem to be involved in co-processing of sensory input - eg,
between columns of cells with similar orientation preference [Gray and
Singer 1989; Livingstone 1996].
</p>

<p align="justify">
Thirdly, it appears increased cortical activation, such as is produced by
driving the mesencephalic reticular formation, enhances synchronous
oscillation [Munk et al 1996].
</p>

<p align="justify">
Fourthly, properties of the stimulus object(s) play a part. One large bar
moving across the visual field produces stronger synchrony than two small
bars concurrently stimulating each of the relevant points in the retina, and
bars moving in separate directions generally produce less synchrony than the
same bars moving in the same direction across the visual field
[Neuenschwander and Singer 1996; Livingstone 1996].
</p>

<p align="justify">
To attempt to provide a concise account for these experimental properties we
have used a lumped continuum model of the cortex which provides an account
of the general spectral content of EEG [Wright 1998]. This approach is
intended to complement other simulations which approximate physiological
realism using feedforward networks with inhibitory surrounds, or single and
multiple orientation domains [Schillen and Konig 1994; Xing and Gerstein
1996; Fuentes et al 1996; Juergens and Eckhorn 1997]. Our object was to
ascertain the minimal assumptions needed to reproduce the experimental data.
The model's parameterisation is as of yet approximate, and physiological
detail is incomplete, but these limitations are not relevant to the
demonstrations we will report. Models closely related to that applied here
have been analysed with regard to cross correlation properties under the
condition that two points on the cortical surface are driven by independent
white noise [Wright 1997; Robinson et al 1998; Chapman et al 1998] yielding
results which have guided the experimental design used here. In this model
synchrony depends wholly upon relatively long-range excitatory connections
in a continuum field - dendritic lag-summations and relatively rapid axonal
transmission being the essential ingredients - while short-range
excitatory/inhibitory interactions appear crucial only to the occurrence of
oscillation. These characteristics are very similar to those observed in
neural network models with intracortical couplings only, observed by Wilson
and Bower [1991]. The continuum formulation supplements the neural network
approach, by enabling a different insight into the physical nature of
synchrony, since the essential non-linearity of individual elements is
avoided, and the stochastic and essentially linear properties of the
neuronal mass is emphasised. Likewise, these intracortical two dimensional
models contrast with the work of Lumer et al [1997a,b] who studied
conditions for synchrony and oscillation in a neural-network model of the
thalamocortical system. They observed synchrony at many levels, which they
attributed largely to re-entrant activity at multiple levels in the pathway.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the present model reproduction of the physiological experiments required
additional simple assumptions about the signal-to-noise ratio of cortex, and
cross correlation in afferent volleys associated with individual stimulus
objects, as will be described with the methods.
