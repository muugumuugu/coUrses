<b>Announcement</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Paul will present a range of exciting digital environments he has
been involved with that exploit two aspects of our visuals system not
normally engaged by our everyday small screen displays. These are the
depth perception arising from our two horizontally offset eyes and
our peripheral vision that is often attributed to our sense of "being
there". Applications to visualisation, entertainment, simulation,
gaming, and education will be discussed as well as some consideration
of what content developers need to do in order to create imagery for
these environments.
