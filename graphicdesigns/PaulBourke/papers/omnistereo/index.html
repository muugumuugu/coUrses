<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
In the following I discuss and derive the optical requirements for 
stereoscopic projection into hemispherical domes, this is applicable to both 
large scale planetariums and smaller personal domes. It is the development 
of the later smaller domes, referred to as the iDome, that employ a new 
lower cost projection system [Bourke 2005] that has been the motivation 
for this work. Primarily the discussion focuses on how to create optimal 
omni-directional stereoscopic fisheye pairs, that is, stereoscopic 
projections that are largely view direction independent. These have some 
interesting differences and challenges to the usual planar perspective pairs 
encountered in systems comprising of flat display panels.
