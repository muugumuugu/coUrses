<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Physical workload management is a major consideration of elite level coaching. Regrettably this paradigm limits the time a coach has to improve player performance and there is a need to develop training methods which have minimal impact on an athlete's workload. This study aimed to assess a novel zero impact perceptual (ZIP) training program's effectiveness in reducing biomechanical factors associated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during an evasive sidestepping (ES) task.
