<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
In this presentation I will outline some of my Apple based projects from 2010. The common theme is the capture of high resolution images and video along with novel ways of presenting that material. Specific projects include a Unity based application in virtual heritage called EON (Eye of Naguar), an application of high resolution 360 degree video in the iDome based upon cultural events in Turkey, an exploration of the Kinect as a wireless user interface, and finally a gallery installation at the recently opened Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart presenting visualisations of an Egyptian mummy named Pausiris.
