<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
There exist a number of technologies for capturing high resolution digital photography and subsequently presenting it on novel display devices. There are often challenges due to the volume of data involved and the desire for a versatile remapping in real time on innovative display geometries. The issues associated with real time display and visualisation of high resolution imagery are likely to be encountered with image capture in other disciplines as sensors continue to improve. In this presentation the characteristics of some of the photographic capture options and subsequent display devices will be discussed. Examples will be presented in the areas of virtual heritage visualisation, remote operations, survey and capture of geographic data.
