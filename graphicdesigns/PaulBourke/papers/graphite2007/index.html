Planetariums and other hemispherical displays are increasingly embracing the 
exciting possibilities offered by digital fulldome projection. Once the 
domain of high budget operations, there now exist a wider range of projection 
technologies suited to small inflatable domes to multi-projector systems in 
large fixed domes. As a consequence of fulldome projection the opportunities 
for planetariums as an immersive environment is expanding to more than the 
traditional astronomy education, for example, education in other science 
disciplines, pure entertainment, gaming, and artistic endeavours.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This course will introduce and discuss the basics of digital fulldome content 
creation and the various projection options. It will be targeted towards 
those who have recently started working in this area or are contemplating 
doing so. The course will concentrate on the fundamental principles of 
fisheye generation/projection rather than any one particular software 
package or technology. Upon completing the course attendees should feel 
comfortable working and problem solving in the discipline.
