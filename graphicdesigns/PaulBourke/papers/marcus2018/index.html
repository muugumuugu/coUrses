<b>Abstract</b>

<p align="justify">
Increasing knee stability via appropriate muscle activation could reduce 
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk during unplanned sidestepping. 
High-level athletes may activate their knee muscles differently from low-level 
athletes when responding to quasi-game realistic versus non game-realistic stimuli. 
Eleven high-level and 10 low-level soccer players responded to a non 
game-realistic arrow-planned condition (AP), a quasi game-realistic one-defender 
scenario (1DS) and two-defender scenario (2DS), and an arrow-unplanned condition 
(AUNP), that imposed increasing time constraints to sidestep. Activation from 
eight knee muscles during sidestepping was measured during pre-contact and 
weight-acceptance. Knee flexor-extensor co-activation ratios were established. 
Muscle activation levels increased by approximately 27% solely in the 1DS in 
both sidestepping phases. In the 2DS, the shift from a flexor dominant 
co-activation strategy in pre-contact toward extensor dominance in weight-acceptance commenced earlier for the high-level players. Quasi game-realistic information 
allowed for anticipatory increases in knee muscle activation regardless of 
expertise levels but only when the time demands to respond were low (1DS). 
High-level players were better at interpreting complex game- realistic 
information (2DS) to activate their knee extensors earlier in preparation 
for single-leg landing during weight-acceptance.
