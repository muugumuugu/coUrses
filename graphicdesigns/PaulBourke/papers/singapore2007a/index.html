In this seminar I will present the challenges and outcomes of a number of 
visualisation projects I have been involved in over the last few years. 
This will include, but will not limited to, large scale cosmology simulations and 
distributed interactive rendering of high resolution volumetric datasets. Some 
discussion will be given to proposing frameworks that can be used to present the 
results of scientific data visualisation not only to the researchers and 
scientists but to a wider audience (eg: museum exhibits for the general 
public) and in a range of visual styles (eg: publication, posters, exhibition). The 
discussion will additionally touch on some more unusual/exotic forms of 
presentation including rapid prototyping and holography. Finally I will 
propose what I imagine to be some of the challenges and future opportunities for 
visualisation.
