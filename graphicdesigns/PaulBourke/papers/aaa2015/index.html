<b>Abstract</b><br>
<p align="justify">
The wreck site of the Dutch East India Company Batavia (1629) has long been associated with terrestrial archaeological 
sites on the islands adjacent to the site. It is known from the journal of the commander of the ship, Francisco Pelsaert of 
the events that took place on these islands. Numerous people including men women and children were brutally 
murdered by a group of mutineers. In the 1950s, Beacon Island was occupied by people involved in the fishing industry. 
Problems arose between the requirements of maintaining the industry and the management of the archaeology of 
Australia's oldest European habitation site including damage to a mass grave. The WA Museum has responsibility for 
these sites under both State and Federal legislation. As a result of the developing problems on Beacon Island 
negotiations were undertaken to relocate the fishers from the Island. While this was underway the Museum obtained a 
Your Community Heritage grant to start recording the buildings and their heritage significance with the objective that 
when the fishers were relocated the buildings would be demolished and it would be important to record these buildings 
for posterity. In 2013 The University of Western Australia was awarded an Australian Research Council Linkage grant 
called Shipwrecks of the Roaring 40s. The aim of this grant is to investigate new technologies that are available since the 
work of the WA museum in the 1970s and 80s. It was decided to incorporate this heritage project as part of the Roaring 
40s with the idea of producing a digital 3D representation of Beacon Island and the fisher's buildings as a method of 
recording the heritage that existed prior to the demolition. This paper examines the methods and techniques used to 
record a range of digital assets from the island and the resulting opportunities by which these allow the heritage to be 
experienced and conveyed in novel and engaging ways.
