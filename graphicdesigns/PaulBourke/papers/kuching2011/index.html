<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will be the worlds largest
radio telescope that will be at least 50 times more powerful than the current
most powerful radio telescope. It will enable astronomers to see the
formation of the early Universe, including the emergence of the first
stars, galaxies and other structures. While the SKA will not be built
until the 2020 time frame, the Australia SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is
being built now in the outback of Western Australia. In this
presentation the SKA will be introduced followed by recent photography
of the pathfinder dishes in Western Australia where the presenter is
based. Also introduced will be the significant technological
challenges of the project in terms of computing, networking, storage,
and visualisation.

<b>Realm of Light, a brief history of time.</b><br>
The film tells in breathtaking pictures the story of the genesis and
the evolution of the universe and our world - from the big bang until
today. A philosophical approach to the origins of space and our life.

<b>Kaloukahina, the enchanted reef.</b><br>
The vastness of our planet's oceans guards unimaginable secrets. One
of its most precious is "Kaluoka'hina", the enchanted reef whose magic
protects it against humans finding it. Kaluoka'hina's colourful
inhabitants have thus always lived in peace... until the volcano
erupts, and the spell is broken.
Now it's up to the young sawfish Jake and his paranoid pal Shorty to
restore the magic of Kaluoka'hina. Their only lead: the ancient legend
that tells of touching the moon.
But how is a fish supposed to touch the moon? This is just one of the
intriguing puzzles that Jake and Shorty have to solve on their most
exciting adventure ever: the quest to save their beloved reef.
