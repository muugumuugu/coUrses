<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Postural stability or postural sway is a common feature investigated in 
clinical and sports settings. Centre of mass (CoM) and centre of pressure 
(CoP) are the main features available to quantify postural stability, with 
centre of mass being a 3-dimensional movement whereas centre of pressure 
varies in two dimensions. Temporal and 2-dimensional data have been intensively 
studied for both CoM and CoP including fractal analysis. The current study 
applied a 3-dimensional representation of planar and vertical data to 
investigate changes in CoM whilst undertaking a balance test. The box-counting 
fractal analysis method was applied in 3-dimensions and the fractal dimension 
of CoM dispersion determined. Eight participants were recruited to undertake 
the Y-Balance Test, which requires participants to stand on their dominant 
leg and maximally stretch the non-dominant leg in the anterior, medio-lateral 
and medio-posterior direction. Participants were tested with and without 
support taping (static tape, ST) applied to the ankle, lower leg and thigh. 
3-dimensional motion capture data and ground reaction forces were used to 
calculate CoM following kinetic and kinematic assessment of the pelvis and 
lower limb. Static taping significantly decreased complexity of CoM dispersion 
(postural sway) compared to no taping (x̅±SD; 1.29±0.05 & 1.20±0.04; p=0.003). 
Our results indicated that 3-dimension fractal analysis is a robust method to 
investigate postural stability, it provides objective data on the complexity 
of CoM dispersion during a balance test and the effect of taping. The 
3-dimensional analysis provides a more complete indication of complexity 
compared to current 2-dimensional CoM/CoP measures, as too much or too 
little complexity in CoM dispersion indicates instability and vertical 
changes should be taken into account in addition to horizontal sway. 
Future work will include a larger sample size and investigate factors 
that may contribute to increased or decreased complexity and effect of taping.
