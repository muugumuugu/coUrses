Visualising Pausiris @ MONA</h3>
<p align="justify">
<b>Author(s)</b>: Peter Morse, Paul Bourke (iVEC@UWA)<br><b>Description</b>: Volume visualisation (Drishti) of a high resolution CT scan of the Pausiris mummy (Egypt, Ptolemaic to Roman Period, 100 
BCE - CE 100; Human remains encased in stucco plaster with glass eyes, incised and painted decoration).
<br>At what point does the body cease being a 'she'/'he' and become an 'it'? 
This question asks its corollary: how can 'it' be interrogated and resuscitated and 'enlivened'? For Pausiris, it's a question about deixis set up as a denkmal: who was this person? what was his aliveness like? A person like you and I, who lived and breathed in another time and who believed different things; he understood the world in ways we no longer do.
