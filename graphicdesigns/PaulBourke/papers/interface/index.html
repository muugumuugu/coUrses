<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify">
Computer graphics using CAD software is typically good at 
creating representations of man-made objects using primitives 
such as lines, rectangles, polygons, and curves in 2 D or 
boxes and surfaces in 3D. These geometric primitives and 
usual tools for manipulating them typically prove inadequate 
when it comes to  representing most objects found in nature 
such as clouds, trees, veins, waves, and a clump of mud. 
There has been considerable interest recently in chaos theory 
and fractal geometry as we find that many processes in the 
world can be accurately described using that theory. The 
computer graphics industry is rapidly incorporating these 
techniques to generate stunningly beautiful images as well as 
realistic natural looking structures.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In what follows a description of a few of the more commonly 
used techniques will be given along with an example of each. 
It should be appreciated that usually the example is one from 
an image with a large if not infinite variation depending on 
the parameters, scale, and viewing position.
</p>

<h3>Chaotic Systems</h3>
<p align="justify">
The classic Mandelbrot, 
<a href="index.html#figure1">figure 1</a>, has been the image that has 
greatly popularised chaotic and fractal systems. The 
Mandelbrot set is created by a general technique where a 
function of the form 
</p>
<center> z<sub>n+1</sub> = f(z<sub>n</sub>) </center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
is used to create a series of a complex variable. In the case of 
the Mandelbrot, the function is 
</p>
<center>
f(z<sub>n</sub>) = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + z<sub>o</sub>
</center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
This series is generated for every initial point z<sub>o</sub> 
on some partition of the complex 
plane. To draw an image on a computer screen the point under 
consideration is coloured depending on the behaviour of the 
series which will act in one of the following ways:
</p>
(a) decay to 0<br>
(b) tend to infinity<br>
(c) oscillate among a number of states<br>
(d) exhibit no discernible pattern
<p>
<p align="justify">
In <a href="index.html#figure1">figure 1</a>, 
situation (a) occurs in the interior portion, 
(b) in the exterior, (c) and (d) near the boundary. The 
boundary of the set exhibits infinite detail and variation 
(the boundary will never appear smooth irrespective of the 
zoom factors). as well as self-similarity.
</p>
<p align="justify">
An example using the same technique but a different function 
is called  biomorphs  by CA Pickover. It uses the function 
</p>
<center>
f(z<sub>n</sub>) = sin(z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>) + c 
</center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
and gives rise to many biological looking 
creatures depending on the value of the constant c, see 
<a href="index.html#figure2">figure 2</a>. 
Another example resulting in galactic swirls is 
obtained using the function 
</p>
<center>
f(z<sub>n</sub>) =  u z<sub>n</sub>(1 - z<sub>n</sub>). 
</center>
<p>
<a href="index.html#figure3">Figure 3</a> 
shows part of the function with  <p>
<center>u = -0.7 + 0.8i</center>
<p>

<h3>Strange Attractors</h3>
<p align="justify">
A second technique called hopalong is normally used 
to represent the strange attractor of a chaotic system, for 
example, the well known Julia set. In this case each 
coordinate generated by the series is drawn as a small point, 
ie: we hop-along from one point to the next. 
For an image on a 
plane the series is either an equation of a complex variable 
or else there are two interrelated equations, one of the x and 
one for y coordinate. As an example consider the following 
function:
</p>
<center>
x<sub>n+1</sub> = 
y<sub>n</sub> - sign(x<sub>n</sub>)|b x<sub>n</sub> - c|<sup>0.5</sup>
</center>
<p>
<center>
y<sub>n+1</sub> = a - x<sub>n</sub>
</center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
This series of the x,y coordinates is specified by an initial 
point x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub> 
and three constants a, b, and c. As an example 
see <a href="index.html#figure4">figure 4</a> 
where a=0.4, b=1, and  c=0. Interestingly, for 
strange attractors the initial point does not matter (except 
for a few special cases), ie: all initial  coordinates 
x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub> 
result in the same image. In other words, the image shows the 
x,y pairs that can be generated by the series, any initial 
point will generate the same set of points although they will 
generated in a different order.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Another example attributed to Peter de Jong uses the two 
equations:
</p>
<center>
x<sub>n+1</sub> = sin(a y<sub>n</sub>) - cos(b x<sub>n</sub>)<br>
y<sub>n+1</sub> = sin(c x<sub>n</sub>) - cos(d y<sub>n</sub>)
</center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
This gives swirling tendrils that appear three dimensional, 
an example is shown in 
<a href="index.html#figure5">figure 5</a> where a = -2.23, b = -0.65, c 
= 0.43, d = -2.43.
</p>

<h3>Newton Raphson</h3>
<p align="justify">
This technique is based on the Newton Raphson method of 
finding the solution (roots) to a polynomial equation of the 
form
</p>
<center>
f(z) = a<sub>o</sub> + a<sub>1</sub> z + a<sub>2</sub>z<sup>2</sup>
 + ... + a<sub>m</sub> z<sup>m</sup> = 0
</center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
The method generates a series where the n+1'th 
approximation to the solution is given by
</p>
<center>
z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub> - f(z<sub>n</sub>) / f'(z<sub>n</sub>)
</center>
<p>
<p align="justify">
where f'(z<sub>n</sub>) is the slope (first derivative) of f(z) 
evaluated at z<sub>n</sub>. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
To create a 2D image using this technique 
each point in a partition of the plane is used as initial 
guess, z<sub>0</sub>, 
to the solution. The point is  coloured depending 
on which solution is found and/or how long it took to arrive 
at the solution. A simple example is an application of the 
above to find the three roots of the polynomial 
z<sup>3</sup> - 1 = 0. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<a href="index.html#figure6">Figure 6</a> 
shows the appearance of a small portion of the 
positive real and imaginary quadrant of the complex plane. A 
trademark of chaotic systems is that very similar initial 
conditions can give rise to very different behaviour. In the 
image shown there are points very close together, one of 
which converges to the solution very fast and the other 
converges very slowly.
</p>

<h3>Diffusion Limited Aggregation</h3>
<p align="justify">
Many attractive images can be generated using theory from 
areas of chemistry and physics. One such example is diffusion 
limited aggregation or DLA which describes, among other 
things, the diffusion and aggregation of zinc ions in an 
electrolytic solution onto electrodes. Another more colourful 
description involves a city square surrounded by taverns. 
Drunks leave the taverns and stagger randomly around the 
square until they finally trip over one their insensate 
companions at which time lulled by the sounds of peaceful 
snoring they lie down and fall asleep. The tendril like 
structure is an aerial view of the sleeping crowd in the 
morning, see <a href="index.html#figure7">figure 7</a>.
</p>

<h3>L-Systems</h3>
<p align="justify">
Very recently there has been renewed interest in Lindemayer 
or simply L-Systems. This is a set of string rewriting  rules 
which takes an initial string of characters called the axiom 
and on every iteration replaces each of the characters in the 
string by other strings called production rules. For example 
consider the axiom string: F+F+F+F and the single production 
rule F-->F+F-F-FF+F+F-F
</p>
<p align="justify">
Now if some characters are giving geometric meaning then the 
string can be drawn.
Using these geometric meanings for the symbols an example of 
an axiom, production rule, and the resulting string after a 
few iterations, the result is the well known Koch curve which 
has a fractal dimension between 1 and 2. Production rules can 
specify the full range of classical fractal curves (for 
example the van Koch snowflake, space filling curves such as 
the Hilbert and Peano curves, the dragon curve, as well as 
kolam patterns).
</p>
<p align="justify">
Recent usage of L-Systems is for the creation of realistic 
looking objects that occur in nature and in particular the 
branching structure of plants. Three examples of plant 
structures generated from L-Systems are illustrated in  
<a href="index.html#figure8">figure 8</a>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
One of the important characteristics of L-Systems is that 
only a small amount of information is required to represent 
very complex objects. So while the bushed in 
<a href="index.html#figure8">figure 8</a> contains
many thousands of lines, they can be described in a database 
by only a few bytes of data, the actual bushes are only 
 grown  when required for visual presentation. Using suitably 
designed L-System algorithms it is possible to design the 
L-System production rule that will create a particular class of plant.
</p>

<h3>Iterated Function Systems</h3>
<p align="justify">
Instead of working with lines as in L systems, IFS replaces 
polygons by other polygons as described by a generator. On 
every iteration each polygon is replaced by a suitably 
scaled, rotated, and translated version of the polygons in 
the generator.
</p>
<p align="justify">
From this geometric description it is also possible to derive 
a hopalong description which gives the image that would be 
created after iterating the geometric model to infinity. The 
description of this is a set of contractive transformations 
on a plane to the form below each with an assigned probability.
</p>
<center>
<img src= "interface10.gif" >
</center><p>
<p align="justify">
To run the system an 
initial point is chosen and on each iteration one of the 
transformation is chosen randomly accordingly to the assigned 
probabilities, the resulting points 
(x<sub>n</sub>,y<sub>n</sub>) are drawn on the page.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As in the case of L systems, if the IFS code for a desired 
image can be determined (by something called Collage theorem) 
then large data compression ratios can be achieved. Instead 
of storing the geometry of the very complex object, just the 
IFS generator needs to be stored and the image can be 
generated  when required.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p align="justify">
The real application of much of the above has arisen from 
attempts to model natural phenomena in the world we live in. 
Many of the mathematical techniques have found a firm place 
in the computer graphics industry as a means of creating both 
stunning graphical images as well as very natural looking 
structures. As the techniques become more standardised and 
more application areas are found they are likely to be 
incorporated as one of the standard tools in CAD, painting 
and image processing software packages.

For further reading on this topic a highly recommended book 
is the Science of Fractal Images by H.O. Peitgen and D. 
Saupe, published by Springer-Verlag, 1988. All of these 
systems as well as many others are available form the author 
for the Macintosh family of computers.
