<b>Abstract</b>:<br>
This paper introduces a navigable movie player based upon the QuickTime API. 
Navigable does not mean (as in QuickTime VR) that one can only look around within a 
static image, rather one can navigate within a movie. A key application of this is to 
present interactive movie content not just on a flat screen but also within 
immersive displays, in particular, within hemispherical domes. As such the 
player supports a very general method of mapping the source movie projection 
geometry onto the geometry of the presentation hardware. The result is an 
abstraction of the details of the input movie geometry and the output image 
projection, the exact mapping and navigation mode is contained with a data 
file rather than within the movie player software itself. A description of the 
player will be presented along with details of the mapping between source and 
destination geometries, and finally a number of practical examples.
