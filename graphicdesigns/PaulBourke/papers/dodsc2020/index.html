<b>Abstract</b><p>
<p align="justify">
I will present a direct method of capturing high resolution omnidirectional stereoscopic 360 panorama images. The approach is not new but was chosen by the constraints imposed by remote field work and the requirements of the intended large scale immersive projection system. The digital camera rig developed will be compared to an existing film based camera which, perhaps surprisingly, still has some advantages in certain environments over its digital cousin.
