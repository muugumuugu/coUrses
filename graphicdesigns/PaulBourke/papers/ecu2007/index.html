<b>Abstract</b><br>
<p align="justify">
I will present and discuss the relative merits of a number
of technologies that he is involved with that present graphical
information to the human visual system so as to exploit
characteristics not normally engaged by small flat traditional
computer displays. This will include stereoscopic projection and
environments such as VROOM (the Virtual ROOM), a 360 degree
stereoscopic cylindrical display, large scale planetarium domes, and a
small personal hemispherical display. Applications of such
environments include visualisation, engaging spaces for education,
entertainment, and gaming. Some discussion will also be given to what
application and game developers need to do in order to create content
for such environments.
