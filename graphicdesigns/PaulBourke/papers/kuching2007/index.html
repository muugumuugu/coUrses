<h1>Scientific Visualisation for Astronomy Research and Public Outreach</h1>
Presented by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
Kuching Planetarium. June 2007

<p align="justify">
In this talk the outcomes from a number of recent projects will be 
presented where visualisation techniques have been applied to astrophysics 
research as well as being used for public education in astronomy. These 
projects will include, but will not be limited to, observational datasets 
such as large galaxy surveys, particle simulations of galaxy 
interaction/formation, and large scale cosmological simulations 
computed on supercomputers. In addition to the benefits to researchers 
I will demonstrate how the graphical results from visualisation can 
be used for educational purposes to both adults and school children. 
Particular emphasis will be placed on the use of new digital 
technology such as stereoscopic and fulldome projection in order 
to engage the audience. This talk will be highly visual in nature 
and will include a live demonstration of an exciting new fulldome 
digital projection technology presented on the Kuching planetarium dome.
