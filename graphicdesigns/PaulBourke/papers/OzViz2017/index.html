<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
High quality digital representations of objects, place and events are 
key to many data capture applications in archaeology and cultural heritage. 
I will present examples of world leading quality capture of complex 3D 
heritage objects and spaces, including how they may be used as a digital 
record and presented in galleries and museum exhibitions. Also presented 
will be a custom camera rig for acquiring artefact free stereoscopic 360 
degree panoramas and how it can used to acquire and subsequently present 
high resolution experiences of a place.
