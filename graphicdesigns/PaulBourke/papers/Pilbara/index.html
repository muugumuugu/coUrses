<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
Recording techniques such as laser scanning, photogrammetry and photographic 
reconstruction are not new to archaeology. However as technology evolves and 
becomes more readily available such methods are being more regularly employed 
within a cultural heritage management context, often by people with little 
experience in using these technologies for heritage applications. For most cultural 
heritage management practitioners, the awe and lure of technology and the ease with 
which it can bring archaeology to life can distract from the end game of managing the 
site on the ground. This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of laser 
scanning, photogrammetry and photographic reconstruction in recording, managing and 
interpreting rock art sites with an emphasis on its practical applications to the 
field of heritage management. Using a case study from West Angelas in the East Pilbara 
region of Western Australia, we will examine how these technologies assist in the 
practical management of heritage sites, and the significant outputs achieved for 
Aboriginal stakeholder groups in remote access to, and the interpretation of 
indigenous heritage sites.
