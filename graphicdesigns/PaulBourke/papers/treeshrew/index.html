<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
The local-global map hypothesis states that locally organized response properties --- 
such as orientation preference --- result from
visuotopically organized local maps of non-retinotopic response properties. 
In the tree shrew, the lateral extent of horizontal patchy
connections is as much as 80-100% of V1 and is consistent with the length 
summation property. We argue that neural signals can be
transmitted across the entire extent of V1 and this allows the formation of maps at the 
local scale that are visuotopically organized.
We describe mechanisms relevant to the formation of local maps and report modelling 
results showing the same patterns of horizontal
connectivity, and relationships to orientation preference, seen in vivo. The 
structure of the connectivity that emerges in the
simulations reveals a "hub and spoke" organization. 
Singularities form the centers of local maps, and linear zones and saddle-points
arise as smooth border transitions between maps. These findings are used to 
present the case for the local-global map hypothesis for tree shrew V1.
