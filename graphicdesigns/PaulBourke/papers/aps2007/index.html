<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify">
The planetarium industry is embracing fulldome video in order to present their 
traditional astronomy material in an engaging and immersive environment. There are 
many other applications and projection environments that employ fulldome video 
for the same reasons but which the planetarium community may be less familiar with. 
This talk will present some of the more unique projects by the author that employ 
fulldome video. This will include fulldome projection into the largest dome in 
Australia, some recent work with navigable movies that extend the usual concept of 
passive movie viewing and storytelling, a fulldome projection environment designed for 
viewing by animals, and personal single person domes. These will be illustrated with 
content examples from a number of diverse disciplines from scientific visualisation to 
virtual heritage.
