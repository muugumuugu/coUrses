This is the format used for, among other things, the topographic
grid data for the mare terrain databases. The files are plain ASCII
with 6 columns as follows.

<li>Average observed radius

The MOLA IEGDR is in the form of an ASCII table with one row for each
  latitude-longitude bin, from 90 to -90 degrees latitude and from 0 to 
  360 degrees longitude. The binned data include all MOLA nadir 
  observations from the Orbit Insertion phase, plus Mapping Phase nadir 
  observations, plus off-nadir observations of the north pole above 86
  degrees latitude acquired during spring 1998 and of both poles taken
  in July 1999. Orbits 355 and 358 of the Orbit Insertion Phase and 
  orbits 10709 through 10716, inclusive, of the Mapping Phase are 
  excluded because solutions for these orbits are deemed to be poor. 
  (Note: subtract 10000 from MOLA mapping phase orbit number to determine 
  the equivalent MGS Project orbit number.) Also excluded are shots more 
  than 1 degree off-nadir (except as noted above), channel 4 returns, 
  and any returns not classified as ground returns, e.g. clouds or noise, 
  according to the SHOT_CLASSIFICATION_CODE.  Most observations have been 
  crossover-corrected. The polar observations have not been fully 
  corrected and may be revised somewhat, as the pointing of the 
  instrument is not known as accurately as the range measurement.

<p align="justify">
  The IEGDR may be released at various grid resolutions. Examples are 1 
  degree latitude by 1 degree longitude bins, 0.5 by 0.5 degree bins, 
  and 0.25 by 0.25 degree bins. The IEGDR file name is in the form
  IEGnnn_v.TAB, where nnn represents the bin size and v the version.
  For example, the first release of the 0.5 by 0.5 degree IEGDR is named 
  IEG050_A.TAB.

The areocentric coordinate system [DAVIESETAL1994B], more
  generally described as planetocentric, is body-centered, using the
  center-of-mass as the origin.  Areocentric latitude is defined by
  the angle between the equatorial plane and a vector extending from
  the origin of the coordinate system to the relevant point on the
  surface.  Latitude is measured from -90 degrees at the south pole to
  +90 degrees at the north pole.  Longitude extends from 0 to 360
  degrees, with values increasing eastward (i.e., it is a right-handed
  coordinate system) from the prime meridian [DAVIESETAL1994B].  This
  coordinate system is preferred for use in geophysical studies in
  which, for example, estimates of elevation or gravitational
  potential are generated mathematically.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The areographic system (more generally, the planetographic
  system) uses the same center-of-mass origin and coordinate axes as
  the areocentric coordinate system.  Areographic latitudes are
  defined by a vector normal to a reference ellipsoid surface.
  Longitudes are measured from the prime meridian and increase toward
  the west since Mars is a prograde rotator [DAVIESETAL1994B].  This
  system is standard for cartography of Mars and most existing maps
  portray locations of surface features in areographic coordinates.
  For MGS, the following data have been adopted as standard for
  defining the reference spheroid for computing the areographic
  latitudes [DAVIESETAL1994B]:
</p>
          Equatorial radius = 3397 km<br>
          Polar radius      = 3375 km<br>
          Flattening        = 0.0064763<br>
<p align="justify">
  Note that the flattening is computed as one minus the ratio of
  the polar radius to the equatorial radius.  The relationship between
  areographic and areocentric latitudes is approximated as:
</p>
          tan(lc) = (1-f) * (1-f) * tan(lg)
<p>
  where:  f = flattening<br>
       lg = areographic latitude<br>
       lc = areocentric latitude<br>
<p align="justify"> 
  While the official MGS Project coordinate system is the IAU 1994
  convention specified in DAVIESETAL1994B, the MOLA data are located in
  the IAU 1991 system, which differs only in the prime meridian W0 at
  J2000. To convert MOLA east longitude from IAU 1991 to IAU 1994, one
  must subtract 0.033 degrees; i.e.,
  areocentric_longitude_East_94 = areocentric_longitude_East_91 - 0.033.
