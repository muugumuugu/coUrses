<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p align="justify">
      The  Utah  RLE  (Run Length Encoded) format is designed to provide an
    efficient, device  independent  means  of  storing  multi-level  raster
    images.    Images of arbitrary size and depth can be saved.  The design
    of the format is presented, followed by  descriptions  of  the  library
    routines used to create and read RLE format files.
</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
  The Utah RLE (Run Length Encoded) format is designed to provide an efficient,
device independent means of storing multi-level  raster  images.    It  is  not
designed  for  binary  (bitmap) images.  It is built on several basic concepts.
The central concept is that of a channel.  A channel corresponds  to  a  single
color,  thus  there  are  normally  a  red channel, a green channel, and a blue
channel.  Up to 255 color channels  are  available  for  use;  one  channel  is
reserved  for  "alpha"  data.    Although  the format supports arbitrarily deep
channels, the current implementation is restricted to 8 bits per channel.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Image data is stored in an 
RLE file in a scanline form,  with  the  data  for
each  channel of the scanline grouped together.  Runs of identical pixel values
are compressed into a count and a  value.    However,  sequences  of  differing
pixels are also stored efficiently (not as a sequence of single pixel runs).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The  file  header  contains  a  large  amount of information about the image,
including its size, the number of channels  saved,  whether  it  has  an  alpha
channel,  an optional color map, and comments.  The comments may be used to add
arbitrary extra information to the saved image.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  A subroutine interface has been written to allow programs to read  and  write
files  in  the  RLE  format.  Two interfaces are available, one that completely
interprets the RLE file and returns scanline pixel data, and one that returns a
list  of  "raw"  run  and  pixel  data.  The second is more efficient, but more
difficult to use, the first is easy to use, but slower.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The Utah RLE format has been used to save images from many  sources,  and  to
display  saved  images  on  many  different  displays  and  from many different
computers.
</p>

<h3>Description of RLE Format</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
 All data in the RLE file is treated as  a  byte  stream.    Where  quantities
larger than 8 bits occur, they are written in PDP-11 byte order (low order byte
first).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The RLE file consists of two parts, a header followed by scanline data.   The
header contains general information about the image, while the scanline data is
a stream of operations describing the image itself.
</p>

<b>2.1 The Header</b>

<center><img src="http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/urt/header.gif">
<a name="21">
<br>Figure 2-1: RLE file header</center><p></a>

<p align="justify"> 
The header has a fixed part and a variable part.  A diagram of the header  is
shown  in  
<a href="index.html#21">Figure  2-1</a>.    
The magic number identifies the file as an RLE file.
Following this are the coordinates of the lower left corner of  the  image  and
the size of the image in the X and Y directions.  Images are defined in a first
quadrant coordinate system (origin at the  lower  left,  X  increasing  to  the
right, Y increasing up.)  Thus, the image is enclosed in the rectangle
</p>

<p><center>[xpos,xpos+xsize-1]X[ypos,ypos+ysize-1]</center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
The  position  and  size are 16 bit integer quantities; images up to 32K square
may be saved (the sizes should not be negative).
</p>

A flags byte follows.  There are currently four flags defined:
<p>
<table><tr><td valign="top">
ClearFirst</td><td valign="top">
If this flag is set, the image rectangle should first be cleared
               to the background color (q.v.) before reading the scanline data.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
NoBackground</td><td valign="top">
If  this  flag  is set, no background color is supplied, and the
               ClearFirst flag should be ignored.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
Alpha</td><td valign="top">
This flag indicates the presence of an  "alpha"  channel.    The
               alpha channel is used by image compositing software to correctly
               blend anti-aliased edges.  It is stored as channel -1 (255).
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
Comments</td><td valign="top">
If this flag is set, comments are present in the  variable  part
               of the header, immediately following the color map.
</td></tr></table>

<p align="justify"> 
The next byte is treated as an unsigned 8 bit value, and indicates the number
of color channels that were saved.  It  may  have  any  value  from  0  to  254
(channel 255 is reserved for alpha values).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The  pixelbits  byte  gives the number of bits in each pixel.  The only value
currently supported by the software is 8  (in  fact,  this  byte  is  currently
ignored when reading RLE files).  Pixel sizes taking more than one byte will be
packed low order byte first.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The next two bytes describe the size and shape of the color map.    Ncmap  is
the  number  of  color  channels in the color map.  It need not be identical to
ncolors, but interpretation of values of ncmap different from 0, 1, or  ncolors
may  be  ambiguous,  unless  ncolors  is  1.  If ncmap is zero, no color map is
saved.  Cmaplen is the log base 2 of the length of each channel  of  the  color
map.  Thus, a value for cmaplen of 8 indicates a color map with 256 entries per
channel.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Immediately following the fixed header is  the  variable  part  of  the  file
header.  It starts with the background color.  The background color has ncolors
entries; if necessary, it is filled out to an odd number of bytes with a filler
byte  on  the  end  (since  the  fixed header is an odd number bytes long, this
returns to a 16 bit boundary).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Following the background color is the color  map,  if  present.    Color  map
values  are  stored as 16 bit quantities, left justified in the word.  Software
interpreting the color map must apply a shift appropriate to the application or
to  the  hardware  being  used.    This convention permits use of the color map
without knowing the original output precision.  The channels  of  the  map  are
stored  in  increasing  numerical  order  (starting  with  channel 0), with the
entries of each channel stored also in increasing order  (starting  with  entry
0).  The color map entries for each channel are stored contiguously.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Comments,  if  present,  follow  the color map.  A 16 bit quantity giving the
length of the comment block comes first.  If the length is odd, a  filler  byte
will  be  present  at the end, restoring the 16 bit alignment (but this byte is
not part  of  the  comments).    The  comment  block  contains  any  number  of
null-terminated text strings.  These strings will conventionally be of the form
"name=value", allowing for easy retrieval of specific  information.    However,
there  is  no restriction that a given name appear only once, and a comment may
contain an arbitrary string.  The intent of  the  comment  block  is  to  allow
information to be attached to the file that is not specifically provided for in
the RLE format.
</p>

<b>2.2 Scanline data</b><br>

<center><p><img src="http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/urt/opcode.gif"><br>
<a name="22">
Figure 2-2:   RLE file operand formats</center></a><p>

<p align="justify"> 
Each  operation  is  identified  by an 8 bit opcode, and may have one or more
operands.  Single operand operations fit into a  single  16  bit  word  if  the
operand  value is less than 256.  So that operand values are not limited to the
range 0..255, each operation has a long variant, in which  the  byte  following
the  opcode  is  ignored  and the following word is taken as a 16 bit quantity.
The long variant of an opcode is indicated by  setting  the  bit  0x40  in  the
opcode (this allows for 64 opcodes, of which 6 have been used so far.)  The two
single operand formats are shown pictorially in 
<a href="index.html#22">Figure 2-2</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The individual operations will now be discussed in detail.  The  descriptions
are  phrased  in  terms  of the actions necessary to interpret the file.  Three
indices are necessary: the current channel, the scanline number, and the  pixel
index.  The current channel is the channel to which data operations apply.  The
scanline number is just the Y position of the scanline in the image.  The pixel
index is the X position of the pixel within the scanline.  The operations are:
</p>

<table><tr><td valign="top">
SkipLines</td><td valign="justify">
    Increment  the  scanline  number  by  the  operand  value.  This
               operation terminates the current  scanline.    The  pixel  index
               should be reset to the xpos value from the header.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
SetColor</td><td valign="justify">
     Set  the  current  channel to the operand value.  This operation
               does not have a long variant.  Note that an operand value of 255
               will  be interpreted as a -1, indicating the alpha channel.  All
               other operand values are positive.  The pixel index is reset  to
               the xpos value.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
SkipPixels</td><td valign="justify">
   Skip over pixels in the current scanline.  Increment pixel index
               by the operand value.   Pixels  skipped  will  be  left  in  the
               background color.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
PixelData</td><td valign="justify">
    Following this opcode is a sequence of pixel values.  The length
               of the sequence is given by the operand value.  If the length of
               the  sequence  is  odd, a filler byte is appended.  Pixel values
               are inserted into the scanline in increasing X order.  The pixel
               index is incremented by the sequence length.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
Run </td><td valign="justify">
    This  is  the only two operand opcode.  The first operand is the
               length (N) of the run.  The second operand is the  pixel  value,
               followed  by  a  filler  byte  if necessary(E.g., a 16 bit pixel
               value would not need a filler byte.).  The next N pixels in  the
               scanline  are  set to the given pixel value.  The pixel index is
               incremented by N, to point to the pixel following the run.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
EOF  </td><td valign="justify">
  This opcode has no operand, and indicates the  end  of  the  RLE
               file.    It  is  provided  so that RLE files may be concatenated
               together  and  still  be  correctly  interpreted.    It  is  not
               required,  a  physical end of file will also indicate the end of
               the RLE data.
</td></tr></table>

<b>2.3 Subroutine Interface</b><br>

<p align="justify"> 
  Two similar subroutine interfaces are provided for reading and writing  files
in  the  RLE format.  Both read or write a scanline worth of data at a time.  A
simple "row" interface communicates in terms of arrays of pixel values.  It  is
simple  to  use,  but  slower  than  the  "raw" interface, which uses a list of
"opcode" values as its communication medium.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  In both cases, the interface must be initialized by calling a set-up function.
The two types of calls may be interleaved; for example, in a rendering program,
the background could be written using  the  "raw"  interface,  while  scanlines
containing image data could be converted with the "row" interface.  The package
allows multiple RLE streams to be open simultaneously, as is necessary for  use
in  a  compositing  tool,  for  example.  All data relevant to a particular RLE
stream is contained in a "globals" structure.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The globals structure echoes the format of the RLE header.   The  fields  are
described below:
</p>

<table><tr><td valign="top">
  dispatch</td><td valign="top">
     The  RLE  creation routines are capable of writing various types
               of output files in addition to RLE.  This value is an index into
               a dispatch table.  This value is initialized by sv_setup.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  ncolors </td><td valign="top">  The  number  of  color  channels in the output file.  Up to this
               many color channels will be saved, depending on  the  values  in
               the channel bitmap (see below).
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  bg_color </td><td valign="top">
 A  pointer  to  an  array  of  ncolors  integers  containing the
               background color.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  alpha </td><td valign="top">
   If this is non-zero, an  alpha  channel  will  be  saved.    The
               presence  or  absence  of  an alpha channel has no effect on the
               value in ncolors.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  background</td><td valign="top">
Indicates how to treat background pixels.  It has the  following
               values:
<pre>
               0    Save all pixels, the background color is ignored.
               1    Save  only  non-background pixels, but don't set the "clear
                    screen" bit.  This indicates "overlay" mode, a  cheap  form
                    of compositing (but see note below about this.)
               2    Save  only  non-background  pixels, clear the screen to the
                    background color before restoring the image.
</pre>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax</td><td valign="top">
               Inclusive bounds of the image region being saved.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  ncmap </td><td valign="top">  Number of channels of color map to be saved.  The color map will
               not be saved if this is 0.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  cmaplen </td><td valign="top">
 Log base 2 of the number of entries in each channel of the color
               map.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  cmap </td><td valign="top">
  Pointer  to an array containing the color map.  The map is saved
               in "channel major" order.  Each entry in the map  is  a  16  bit
               value  with the color value left justified in the word.  If this
               pointer is NULL, no color map will be saved.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  comments </td><td valign="top">
Pointer to an array of  pointers  to  strings.    The  array  is
               terminated  by  a  NULL  pointer  (like  argv or envp).  If this
               pointer is NULL or if the first pointer it points  to  is  NULL,
               comments will not be saved.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  fd </td><td valign="top">     File  (FILE *) pointer to be used for writing or reading the RLE
               file.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
  bits </td><td valign="top">
A bitmap containing 256 bits.   A  channel  will  be  saved  (or
               retrieved)  only  if the corresponding bit is set in the bitmap.
               The alpha channel corresponds to bit 255.  The bitmap allows  an
               application   to  easily  ignore  color  channel  data  that  is
               irrelevant to it.
</td></tr></table>

<p align="justify"> 
  The globals structure also contains private data for use by the  RLE  reading
and  writing  routines;  data  that  must be maintained between calls, but that
applies to each stream separately.
</p>

<b>2.4. Writing RLE files</b><br>

<p align="justify"> 
To create  a  run-length  encoded  file,  one  first  initializes  a  globals
structure  with  the relevant information about the image, including the output
file descriptor.  The output file should be open and empty.    Then  one  calls
sv_setup:
</p>

<pre>
    sv_setup( RUN_DISPATCH, &globals );
</pre>

<p align="justify"> 
This  writes the file header and initializes the private portions of the global
data structure for use by the RLE file writing routines.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The image data must be available or expressible in a scanline order (with the
origin  at  the  bottom of the screen).  After each scanline is computed, it is
written to the output file by calling one of sv_putrow  or  sv_putraw.    If  a
vertical  interval  of  the  image  has  no  data, it may be skipped by calling
sv_skiprow:
</p>

<pre>
    /* Skip nrow scanlines */
    sv_skiprow( &globals, nrow );
</pre>

<p align="justify"> 
  If the image data for a scanline is available as an array  of  pixel  values,
sv_putrow  should be used to write the data to the output file.  As an example,
let us assume that we have a 512 pixel long scanline, with three color channels
and no alpha data.  We could call sv_putrow as follows:
</p>

<pre>
    rle_pixel scandata[3][512], *rows[3];
    int i;

    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++ )
        rows[i] = scandata[i];
    sv_putrow( rows, 512, &globals );
</pre>

<p align="justify"> 
Note  that sv_putrow is passed an array of pointers to vectors of pixels.  This
makes it easy to pass  arbitrarily  many,  and  to  specify  values  of  rowlen
different from the size of (e.g.) the scandata array.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The  first element of each row of pixels is the pixel at the xmin location in
the scanline.  Therefore, when saving only  part  of  an  image,  one  must  be
careful to set the rows pointers to point to the correct pixel in the scanline.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  If  an  alpha  channel  is  specified  to  be saved, things get a little more
complex.  Here is the same example, but now with an alpha channel being saved.
</p>

<pre>
    rle_pixel scandata[3][512],
              alpha[512], *rows[4];
    int i;

    rows[0] = alpha;
    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++ )
        rows[i+1] = scandata[i];
    sv_putrow( rows+1, 512, &globals );
</pre>

<p align="justify"> 
The sv_putrow routine expects to find the pointer to the alpha channel  at  the
-1  position in the rows array.  Thus, we pass a pointer to rows[1] and put the
pointer to the alpha channel in rows[0].
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Finally, after all scanlines have been written, we call sv_puteof to write an
EOF opcode into the file.  This is not strictly necessary, since a physical end
of file also indicates the end of the RLE data, but it is a good idea.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Here is a skeleton of an application that uses sv_putrow to save an image  is
shown  in  
<a href="index.html#23">Figure  2-3</a>.    
This example uses the default values supplied in the
globals variable sv_globals, modifying it to indicate the presence of an  alpha
channel.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Using  sv_putraw is more complicated, as it takes arrays of rle_op structures
instead of just pixels.  If the data is already available in something close to
this  form,  however,  sv_putraw will run much more quickly than sv_putrow.  An
rle_op is a structure with the following contents:
</p>

<pre>
  opcode       The type of data.  One of ByteData or RunData.

  xloc         The X location within the scanline at which this data begins.

  length       The length of the data.  This is either  the  number  of  pixels
               that  are  the  same  color,  for a run, or the number of pixels
               provided as byte data.

  pixels       A pointer to an array of pixel values.  This field is used  only
               for the ByteData opcode.

  run_val      The pixel value for a RunData opcode.
</pre>

<pre>
#include &gt;svfb_global.h&gt;

    main()
    {
            rle_pixel scanline[3][512], alpha[512], *rows[4];
            int y, i;

            /* Most of the default values in sv_globals are ok */
            /* We do have an alpha channel, though */
            sv_globals.sv_alpha = 1;
            SV_SET_BIT( sv_globals, SV_ALPHA );

            rows[0] = alpha;
            for ( i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++ )
                    rows[i+1] = scanline[i];

            sv_setup( RUN_DISPATCH, &sv_globals );

            /* Create output for 512 x 480 (default size) display */
            for ( y = 0; y ^lt; 480; y++ )
            {
                    mk_scanline( y, scanline, alpha );
                    sv_putrow( rows, 512, &sv_globals );
            }
            sv_puteof( &sv_globals );
    }
</pre>
<center><a name="23">
Figure 2-3:   Example of use of sv_putrow</center><p></a>

<p align="justify"> 
  Since  there  is  no guarantee that the different color channels will require
the same set of rle_ops to describe  their  data,  a  separate  count  must  be
provided for each channel.  Here is a sample call to sv_putraw:
</p>

<pre>
    int nraw[3];    /* Length of each row */
    rle_op *rows[3];/* Data pointers */
    sv_putraw( rows, nraw, &globals );
</pre>

<p align="justify"> 
A  more  complete  example  of the use of sv_putraw will be given in connection
with the description of rle_getraw, below.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Calls to sv_putrow and sv_putraw may be freely intermixed, as required by the
application.
</p>

<b>2.5. Reading RLE Files</b><p>

<p align="justify"> 
Reading  an  RLE  file  is much like writing one.  An initial call to a setup
routine reads the file header and fills in the  globals  structure.    Then,  a
scanline at a time is read by calling rle_getrow or rle_getraw.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The  calling  program  is  responsible for opening the input file.  A call to
rle_get_setup will then read the header information and fill  in  the  supplied
globals  structure.   The return code from rle_get_setup indicates a variety of
errors, such as the input file not being an RLE file, or  encountering  an  EOF
while reading the header.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  Each time rle_getrow is called, it fills in the supplied scanline buffer with
one scanline of image data and returns the Y position of  the  scanline  (which
will  be  one  greater than the previous time it was called).  Depending on the
setting of the background flag, the scanline buffer may or may not  be  cleared
to the background color on each call.  If it is not (background is 0 or 1), and
if the caller does not clear the buffer between scanlines,  then  a  "smearing"
effect will be seen, if some pixels from previous scanlines are not overwritten
by pixels on the current scanline.  Note that  if  background  is  0,  then  no
background  color  was  supplied,  and  setting  background  to 2 to try to get
automatic  buffer  clearing  will  usually  cause  a  segmentation  fault  when
rle_getrow tries to get the background color through the bg_color pointer.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
<a href="index.html#24">Figure  2-4</a>  
shows  an  example  of  the use of rle_getrow.  Note the dynamic
allocation of scanline storage space, and compensation for presence of an alpha
channel.    A subroutine, rle_row_alloc, is available that performs the storage
allocation automatically.  It is described below.  If the  alpha  channel  were
irrelevant,  the  macro  SV_CLR_BIT could be used to inhibit reading it, and no
storage space would be needed for it.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The function rle_getraw is the inverse of sv_putraw.  When called,  it  fills
in  the  supplied  buffer  with raw data for a single scanline.  It returns the
scanline y position, or 2   to indicate end of file.  It  is  assumed  that  no
image  will  have  more  than  2  -1 scanlines.  A complete program (except for
error checking) that reads an RLE file  from  standard  input  and  produces  a
negative image on standard output is shown in 
<a href="index.html#25">Figure 2-5</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  The  functions  rle_row_alloc and rle_raw_alloc simplify allocation of buffer
space for use by the rle routines.  Both use a supplied  globals  structure  to
determine how many and which channels need buffer space, as well as the size of
the buffer for each scanline.  The returned buffer pointers  will  be  adjusted
for the presence of an alpha channel, if it is present.  Buffer space for pixel
or rle_op data will be allocate only for those channels that have bits  set  in
the  channel  bitmap.  The buffer space may be freed by calling rle_row_free or
rle_raw_free, respectively.

<b>3. Comments, issues, and directions</b><br>

<p align="justify">
Some comments on the file format and current subroutine implementation:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
    The background color for the alpha channel is always 0.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
    All channels must have the same number of bits.    This  could  be  a
     problem  when  saving,  e.g.,  Z  values,  or  if more than 8 bits of
     precision were desired for the alpha channel.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
    Pixels are skipped (by sv_putrow) only if all channel values  of  the
     pixel are equal to the corresponding background color values.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
    The current Implementation of sv_putrow skips pixels only if at least
     2 adjacent pixels are  equal  to  the  background.    The  SkipPixels
     operation   is   intended   for  efficiency,  not  to  provide  cheap
     compositing.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
    Nothing forces the image data to lie within the  bounds  declared  in
     the header.  However, rle_getrow will not write outside these bounds,
     to prevent core dumps.  No such protection is provided by rle_getraw.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
    Images saved in RLE are usually about 1/3 their original size (for an
     "average"  image).   Highly complex images may end up slightly larger
     than they would have been if saved by the trivial method.
</ul>

<p align="justify">
  We have not yet decided how pixels with other than 8 bits  should  be  packed
into  the file.  To keep the file size down, one would like to pack ByteData as
tightly as possible.  However, for interpretation speed, it would  probably  be
better to save one value in each (pixelbits+7)/8 bytes.
</p>

  Some proposed enhancements include:
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
A "ramp" opcode.  This specifies that pixel values should be linearly
     ramped between two values  for  a  given  number  of  pixels  in  the
     scanline.   This opcode would be difficult to generate from an image,
     but if an application knew it was generating a ramp, it could produce
     significant file size savings (e.g.  in Gouraud shaded images).
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
Opcodes  indicating  that  the  current  scanline is identical to the
     previous, or that it differs only slightly  (presumably  followed  by
     standard  opcodes indicating the difference).  Detection of identical
     scanlines is easy, deciding that a scanline differs  slightly  enough
     to  warrant a differential description could be difficult.  In images
     with  large  areas  with  little  change,  this  could  produce  size
     savings(This  suggestion  was  inspired  by  a description of the RLE
     format used at Ohio State University.)
</p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
  The subroutine library is still missing some useful functions.  Some proposed
additions are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
Conversion from "raw" to "row" format, and back.  One could then view
     sv_putrow as being a "raw" to "row" conversion followed by a call  to
     sv_putraw,  and  rle_getrow as a call to rle_getraw followed by "row"
     to "raw" conversion.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
A function to merge several channels of  "raw"  data  into  a  single
     channel.   For example, this would take separate red, green, and blue
     channels and combine them into a single RGB channel.  This  would  be
     useful  for  RLE interpretation on devices that do not easily support
     the separate channel paradigm, while preserving the efficiency of the
     "raw" interface.  It could also be used to increase the efficiency of
     a compositing program.
</p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
  The Utah RLE format has developed and matured over  a  period  of  about  six
years,  and  has  proven  to  be  versatile  and  useful  for a wide variety of
applications that require  image  transmittal  and  storage.    It  provides  a
compact,  efficiently  interpreted  image storage capability.  We expect to see
continued development of capabilities  and  utility,  but  expect  very  little
change in the basic format.
