The MDL file format has been used for
several rendering projects at Cornell University and Indiana University.
It is a low-tech format that defines a
syntax for storing simple data in text and binary files
which are arranged into nested ``chunks.''
It also defines several standard types of data chunks.
We have written a standard I/O library in C++
that reads and writes MDL files at the syntactic level
and deals with some common chunk types.
<p>

When we invented the mdl file format,
our goal was to have a simple, practical way
of storing models that was fast to read and write,
very easy to use in programs, and reasonably space-efficient.
We also wanted a somewhat human-readable (well, programmer-readable)
text format that would be convenient for small files,
and we wanted it to be easy for programs
that didn't understand some of the data in a file to skip it.
We expected the primary application of the format to be
storing models for realistic rendering,
including complicated materials and large polygon meshes.
<p>

These pages describe the syntax rules of the MDL format,
the MDL chunks that we have defined.
Several example MDL files are also provided.
