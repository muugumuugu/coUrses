The polyhedron's number is also the name of its
description file.

<p align="justify">
The description file consists of a number of fields.
A field header is a line with an initial ":", 
the remainder of the line is the field name.
Fields start with a field header line and are terminated 
by the next field header line or by end of file.
A polyhedron's description is terminated by the field "EOF". 
The fields include, but are not limited to the 
following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>number</b><br>
The polyhedron's number written and read with the
C language %d printf/scanf format.
<p>

<li><b>name</b><br>
The polyhedron's name is less than 128 characters long 
and is not capitalized.
<p>

<li><b>symbol</b><br>
The eqn input for two symbols separated by a tab; the 
Johnson symbol, and the Schla symbol.
<p>

<li><b>dual</b><br>
The name of the dual polyhedron optionally followed 
by a horizontal tab and the number of the dual.
<p>

<li><b>vertices</b><br>
The first line contains the number of vertices. 
The vertices are arranged one per line as an
(x,y,z) coordinate of white-space separated values.
The vertices are implicitly numbered starting at zero.
<p>

<li><b>net</b><br>
The first line contains the number of faces and the 
maximum number of vertices in a face. The remaining 
lines are the faces in the planar net. Each face has a 
vertex count followed by the vertex numbers. The vertices 
are listed in counter-clockwise order as viewed from 
outside the polyhedron.
<p>

<li><b>hinges</b><br>
The first line contains the number of hinges in the 
planar net. The remaining lines are hinge connections. 
The format is
"face1 side1 face2 side2 value". 
Sides are numbered from zero. Depending on the dihedral 
value it may be a reflex or re-entrant hinge.
<p>

<li><b>solid</b><br>
The first line contains the number of faces and the 
maximum number of vertices in a face. The remaining 
lines are the faces in the 3D polyhedron. Each face has 
a vertex count followed by the vertex numbers. The 
vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order as viewed 
from outside the polyhedron.
<p>

<li><b>dihedral</b><br>
The first line contains the number of distinct dihedrals.
Each dihedral starts on a new line and has a count and 
a value.
If the count is non-zero, then that many
"face edge" pairs (one per line) follow the 
dihedral value.
<p>

<li><b>EOF</b><br>
The end of the polyhedron's description.
<p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
A value consists of a floating point number optionally 
followed by a expression enclosed by square brackets "[]".
The expression is the exact value represented in code.
The code may include assignments but does not include white space.
