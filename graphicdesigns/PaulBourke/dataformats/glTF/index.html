glTF is managed by the Khronos Group 3D Formats Working Group, it is a file format
for 3D models, materials and animation (limited) based upon the JSON language.
The format was first proposed in 2012, first implementations in 2013 and version 1.0
formally released in 2015. glTF version 2.0 was announced in 2017.
While glTF is human readable text, parts are encode as a base64 octet stream.
There is also a binary version with extension glb.
