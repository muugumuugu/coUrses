<p align="justify">
The MilkShape 3D format (ms3d) is a binary file with byte ordering and
numerical conventions as per a Windows based computer. The documentation
for the format comes from the header file by Mete Ciragan, this file
for version 1.4 (also holds for version 1.3) is given 
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ms3d/ms3dspec.h">here</a>. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The format consists of a number of sections: a header, list of vertices,
list of triangles with texture coordinates, group lists, list of
materials, and finally joints. Each section is preceded with the
number of items in that section so one can readily jump around the
file reading just the bits of interest.
