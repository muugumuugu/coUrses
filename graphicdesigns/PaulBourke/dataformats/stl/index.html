<h1>STL format</h1>

<p align="justify">
The STL (STereo Lithography) format was developed primarily by
Albert Consulting Group and is perhaps the main standard for rapid
prototyping systems.
The format is specified as both an ASCII (printable character) format
as well as a binary format.
</p>

<b>ASCII</b><p>
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/stl/sample.stl">Sample ascii stl file</a><br>
<p align="justify">
The first line is a description line that must start with the word
"solid" in lower case, 
it then normally contains the file name, author, date etc.
The last line should be the keyword "endsolid".
The lines between the above contain descriptions of 3 vertex facets including
their normals, the ordering of the vertices should comply with the right
hand rule.
As an example consider the following except from a STL file
</p>

<pre>
solid
   :
   :
   facet normal 0.0 0.0 1.0 
   outer loop 
      vertex  1.0  1.0  0.0 
      vertex -1.0  1.0  0.0 
      vertex  0.0 -1.0  0.0 
   endloop
   endfacet
   :
   :
endsolid
</pre>

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign="top">
<p align="justify">
Often the normals need not be provided and they will be generated by
the parsing software/system. The main restriction placed upon the
facets in STL files is that all adjacent facets must share two
common vertices.

</td></tr></table><p>

<b>Binary</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Binary STL files consist of a 80 byte header line that can be interpreted
as a comment string. The following 4 bytes interpreted as a long integer give
the total number of facets.
What follows is a normal and 3 vertices for each facet, each coordinate
represented as a 4 byte floating point number (12 bytes in all).
There is a 2 byte spacer between each facet.
The result is that each facet is represented by 50 bytes, 12 for the
normal, 36 for the 3 vertices, and 2 for the spacer.
