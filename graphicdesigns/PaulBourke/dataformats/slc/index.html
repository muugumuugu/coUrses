<h1>SLC - SLiCe format</h3>
</center>
<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
This is a 2 1/2 dimension file describing slices (contours) through a 
solid model typically for rapid prototyping applications such as
stereo-lithography. It was created by "3D systems" around 1994.
</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The SLC file format is a &quot;21/2D&quot; contour representation of 
        a CAD model.&nbsp; It consists of successive cross-sections taken at ascending 
        Z intervals in which solid material is represented by interior and exterior 
        boundary polylines. SLC data can be generated from various sources, either 
        by conversion from CAD solid or surface models or more directly from systems 
        that produce data arranged in layers, such as CT-scanners.</p>
      <h3>Definition of Terms</h3>
      <h4>Segment</h4>
      <p>A segment is a straight line connecting two X/Y vertices points.</p>
      <h4>Polyline</h4>
      <p>A Polyline is an ordered list of X/Y vertices points connected continuously 
        by each successive line segment.&nbsp; The polyline must be closed whereby 
        the last point must equal the first point in the vertices list.</p>
      <h4>Contour Boundary</h4>
      <p>A boundary is a closed polyline representing interior or exterior solid 
        material.&nbsp; An exterior boundary has its polyline list in counter-clockwise 
        order.&nbsp;The solid material is inside the polyline. An interior boundary 
        has its polyline list in clockwise order and solid material is outside 
        the polyline.</p>
      <h4>Contour Layer</h4>
      <p>A contour layer is a list of exterior and interior boundaries representing 
        the solid material at a specified Z cross-section of the CAD model. The 
        cross-section slice is taken parallel to the X/Y plane and has a specified 
        layer thickness.</p>
      <h3>Data Formats</h3>
      <p>Byte 8 bits<br>
        Character 1 Byte<br>
        Unsigned Integer 4 Bytes<br>
        Float 4 Bytes<br>
        IEEE Format</p>
      <p>Most significant byte of FLOAT is specified in the highest addressed 
        byte.&nbsp; The byte ordering follows the Intel PC Little Indian/Big Indian 
        scheme.</p>
      <p>Address 0 1 2<br>
        3<br>
        Low Word<br>
        High Word<br>
        LSB MSB LSB MSB<br>
        <br>
        Most UNIX RISC Workstations are Big Indian/Little Indian, therefore they 
        need to byte swap all Unsigned Integers and Floats before outputting to 
        the SLC file.</p>
      <h3>Overview of the SLC File Structure</h3>
      <p>The SLC file is divided into a header section, a 3D reserved section, 
        a sample table section, and the contour data section.</p>
      <h4>Header Section</h4>
      <p>The Header section is an ASCII character string containing global information 
        about the part and how it was prepared.<br>
        The header is terminated by a carriage return, line feed and control-Z 
        character (0x0d,0x0a,0x1a) and can be a maximum of 2048 bytes including 
        the termination characters.</p>
      <p>The syntax of the header section is a keyword followed by its appropriate 
        parameter.</p>
      <h3>Header Keywords</h3>
      <h4>&quot;-SLCVER &lt;X.X&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the SLC file format version number.&nbsp; The version number 
        of this specification is 2.0.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-UNIT &lt;INCH/MM&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>indicates which units the SLC data is represented in.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-TYPE &lt;PART/SUPPORT/WEB&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the CAD model type.&nbsp; PART and SUPPORT must be closed contours.&nbsp; 
        WEB types can be open polylines or line segments.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-PACKAGE &lt;vendor specific&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>identifies the vendor package and version number that produced the SLC 
        file.&nbsp; A maximum of 32 bytes.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-EXTENTS &lt;minx,maxx miny,maxy minz,maxz&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>describes the X, Y, and Z extents of the CAD model.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-CHORDDEV &lt;value&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the cordal deviation, if used, to generate the SLC data.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-ARCRES &lt;value in degrees&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the arc resolution, if used, to generate the SLC data.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-SURFTOL &lt;value&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the surface tolerance, if used, to generate the SLC data.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-GAPTOL &lt;value&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the gap tolerance, if used, to generate the SLC data.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-MAXGAPFOUND &lt;value&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies the maximum gap size found when generating the SLC data.</p>
      <h4>&quot;-EXTLWC &lt;value&gt;&quot;</h4>
      <p>specifies if any line width compensation has been applied to the SLC 
        data by the CAD vendor.</p>
      <h4>3D Reserved Section</h4>
      <p>This 256-byte section is reserved for future use.</p>
      <h4>Sampling Table Section</h4>
      <p>The sample table describes the sampling thickness (layer thickness or 
        slice thickness) of the part.&nbsp; There can be up to 256 entries in 
        the table.&nbsp; Each entry describes the Z start, the slice thickness, 
        and what line width compensation is desired for that sampling range.</p>
      <p>Sampling Table Size<br>
        1 Byte<br>
        Sampling Table Entry<br>
        4 Floats<br>
        <br>
        Minimum Z Level<br>
        1 Float<br>
        Layer Thickness<br>
        1 Float<br>
        Line Width Compensation<br>
        1 Float<br>
        Reserved<br>
        1 Float</p>
      <p>The first sampling table entry Z start value must be the very first Z 
        contour layer. For example, if the cross-sections were produced with a 
        single thickness of 0.006 inches and the first Z level of the part is 
        0.4 inches and a line width compensation value of 0.005 is desired, then 
        the sampling table will look like the following:</p>
      <p>Sample Table Size<br>
        1<br>
        Sample Table Entry<br>
        0.4&nbsp; 0.006&nbsp; 0.005&nbsp; 0.0<br>
        <br>
        If for example, the part was sliced with 2 different layer thickness the 
        Sample Table could look like the following:</p>
      <p>Sample Table Size<br>
        2<br>
        Sample Table Entry 1<br>
        0.4&nbsp; 0.005&nbsp; 0.004&nbsp; 0.0<br>
        Sample Table Entry 2<br>
        2.0&nbsp; 0.010&nbsp; 0.005&nbsp; 0.0<br>
        <br>
        Slice thickness must be even multiples of one other to avoid processing 
        problems.</p>
      <h4>Contour Data Section</h4>
      <p>The contour data section is a series of successive ascending Z cross-sections 
        or layers with the accompanying contour data.&nbsp; Each Contour Layer 
        contains the minimum Z layer value, number of boundaries followed by the 
        list of individual boundary data. The boundary data contains the number 
        of x,y vertices for that boundary, the number of gaps, and finally the 
        list of floating point vertices points.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The location of a gap can be determined when a vertice point repeats itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        illustrate, given the contour layer in section 2.4 the contour section 
        could be as follows:</p>
      <p>Z Layer<br>
        0.4<br>
        Number of Boundaries<br>
        2<br>
        Number of Vertices for the 1st<br>
        Boundary 5<br>
        Number of Gaps for the 1st<br>
        Boundary 0<br>
        Vertex List for 1st Boundary<br>
        0.0, 0.0<br>
        <br>
        1.0, 0.0<br>
        <br>
        1.0, 1.0<br>
        <br>
        0.0, 1.0<br>
        <br>
        0.0, 0.0<br>
        <br>
        * Notice the direction of the vertice list is counter-clockwise indicating 
        the solid material is inside the polylist.&nbsp; Also, notice that the 
        polylist is closed because the last vertice is equal to the first vertice.</p>
      <p>Number of Vertices for the 2nd<br>
        Boundary 5<br>
        Number of Gaps for the 2nd<br>
        Boundary 0<br>
        Vertex List for 2nd Boundary<br>
        0.2, 0.2<br>
        <br>
        0.2, 0.8<br>
        <br>
        0.8, 0.8<br>
        <br>
        0.8, 0.2<br>
        <br>
        0.2, 0.2<br>
        <br>
        * Notice the direction of the vertice list is clockwise indicating the 
        solid material is outside the polylist. Also, notice that the polylist 
        is closed because the last vertice is equal to the first vertice.</p>
      <p>The Contour Layers are stacked in ascending order until the top of the 
        part.&nbsp; The last layer, or the top of the part, is indicated by the 
        Z level and a termination unsigned integer (0xFFFFFFFF).<br>
        <br>
        Contour Layer Section Description<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contour Layer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimum Z Level<br>
        Float<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of Boundaries<br>
        Unsigned Integer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of<br>
        Vertices Unsigned Integer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of Gaps<br>
        Unsigned Integer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vertices List<br>
        (X/Y) Number of Vertices * 2 Float<br>
        <br>
        Repeat Number of Boundaries<br>
        1<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat Contour Layer until Top of<br>
        Part<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Top of Part<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum Z Level<br>
        1 Float<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination Value<br>
        Unsigned Integer (0xFFFFFFFF)<br>
        Minimum Z Level for a given Contour Layer<br>
        <br>
        Note that a one-inch cube based at the origin 0,0,0 can be represented 
        simply by only one contour layer and the Top of Part Layer data.</p>
      <p>Suppose the cube was to be imaged in 0.010 layers. The sample table would 
        have a single entry with its starting Z level at 0.0 and layer thickness 
        at 0.01.&nbsp; The contour layer data section could be as follows:<br>
        <br>
        Z Layer<br>
        0.0<br>
        Number of Boundaries<br>
        1<br>
        Number of Vertices for the 1st<br>
        Boundary 5<br>
        Number of Gaps for the 1st<br>
        Boundary 0<br>
        Vertex List for 1st Boundary<br>
        0.0, 0.0<br>
        <br>
        1.0, 0.0<br>
        <br>
        1.0, 1.0<br>
        <br>
        0.0, 1.0<br>
        <br>
        0.0, 0.0<br>
        Z Layer<br>
        1.0<br>
        Termination Value<br>
        0xFFFFFFFF<br>
        <br>
        Notice that only one contour was necessary to describe the entire part.&nbsp; 
        The initial contour will be imaged until the next minimum contour layer 
        or the top of the part at the specified layer thickness described in the 
        sampling table.&nbsp; This part could have had 100 identical contour layers, 
        but that would have been redundant.&nbsp; This is why the contour Z value 
        is referred to as the minimum Z value.&nbsp;&nbsp; It gets repeated until 
        the next contour or top of the part.</p>
