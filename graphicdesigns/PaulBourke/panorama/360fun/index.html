<p align="justify">
So, you've purchased yourself a 360 video camera and you have done some of the 
<a href="../360video/index.html">usual
things</a> ... placed it on top of the car, put it on the table during a dinner party,
walked around the streets or conducted an interview, and
so on. What else can you do?
</p><br><p>

<b>Drone</b><br>
<p align="justify">
While hardly "new" these days, suspending a 360 camera 
from a drone certainly gives an interesting
perspective, especially when viewed within a head mounted display where you experience
weird sensation of being suspended in the air.
The interesting thing technically is how to replace the sky with a synthetic or
photographic replacement, removing all evidence of the drone or the rotor blades.

<b>Looping</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Most 360 video footage is stored as equirectangular panoramas, these are spatially
circular both horizontally and vertically (longitude and latitude). 
One can also make 360 videos that are circular in time.
They loop indefinitely.
"<i>The never ending life of a roundabout</i>".
Video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SN83O6E604">YouTube</a>.

<b>Car tire view</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Can you predict what the camera mounted like this would be like. 
"<i>The life of a car tire</i>". 
The 360 video as an equirectangular can be found on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7lmaIrtYGQ">YouTube</a>.
I won't upload the navigable version ... not a pleasant VR experience,
your disembodied head attached to a car tire.

<b>Train tracks</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Ever wondered what it would be like to be run over by a train?
3.5 minutes in the life of train tracks. Most exciting part of the 
trains track day occurs in this 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItySODsvkXg">YouTube video</a> 
at 2 minutes 50 seconds.
