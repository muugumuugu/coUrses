This document is the user manual for a program on the Macintosh for exploring 4
dimensional geometry. Here we will introduce the concepts of 4D geometry,
describe the use of the application, and present some examples.
</p>

<b>Introduction</b><p>

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
<p align="justify">
One dimensional space consists of the points along a line, only one number is
required to uniquely describe any position in a 1D world. 
</p>
</td><td width="80" align="right">
<IMG width="59" height="20" SRC="hyperspace1.gif">
</td></tr></table><p>

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
<p align="justify">
Two dimensional space consists of all the points on a plane, two numbers are
required to uniquely describe any position in a 2D world. The two numbers used
to describe any point can be considered to be positions on two noncolinear one
dimensional axes, the particular axis system from all the possible combinations
is usually chosen to be the one where the two axes are perpendicular to each
other.
</p>
</td><td width="80" align="right">
<IMG width="61" height="62" SRC="hyperspace2.gif">
</td></tr></table><p>

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
<p align="justify">
For three dimensional space we add another axis perpendicular to the two used
for the two dimensional space. This is what we use to represent the universe we
live in, three numbers uniquely describe any point in our 3D universe and they
are usually given the symbols x,y, and z.
</p>
</td><td width="80" align="right">

</td></tr></table><p>

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
<p align="justify">
In four dimensions we "simply" need to add another coordinate axis that is
perpendicular to the three axes used for 3D space. Most people have difficulty
visualizing this but there is no problem mathematically and we can approach
higher dimensions in the same way (although we won't do so here). We will use
the symbol w to represent the coordinate axis of this 4th dimension. Any point
then in four dimensional space can be represented by the four numbers w,x,y,
and z.

<b>Hyperdimensional objects</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The geometry of familiar objects in higher dimensions is well established
mathematically but is generally outside our everyday experience. A mathematical
approach will not be attempted here but rather the intuitive description of 4D
geometric objects.
</p>

<b>Generation by intuition</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The creation of 4D geometric objects by intuition relies on being able to
determine an progressive description of the equivalent object in 3D and how it
was created from its 2D equivalent. If we "know" how the 3D object is created
from 2D and maybe how the 2D object was created from 1D then the rules can be
applied to the 3D object to form the 4D equivalent.<br> 
In what follows the rules for progressing each geometric primitive from 1 to 2
and then to 3 dimensions is explained. All the geometries below are implemented
in the HyperSpace program, they can be explored there.
</p>

<b>Cube</b><p>

<p align="justify">
A one dimensional cube is a line segment. To create a 2D cube, a square. we
"extrude" the line (1D cube) along the newly introduced axis. To form the 3D
cube we again extrude the square (2D cube) along the newly introduced axis. So
the general technique for generating a n+1 dimensional cube is take the n
dimensional cube and extrude it along the new n+1 dimension.
</p>

<center><IMG width="456" height="260" SRC="hyperspace5.gif"></center><p>

<b>Tetrahedron</b><p>

<p align="justify">
1D tetrahedron is a line. 2D tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle. The n+1
dimension tetrahedron is created by taking the midpoint of the n dimensional
tetrahedron and pulling it into the n+1 dimension.
</p>

<center><IMG width="407" height="189" SRC="hyperspace6.gif"></center><p>

<b>Octahedron</b><p>

<p align="justify">
1D octahedron is a line. 2D octahedron is a square. To form a n+1 dimensional
octahedron take the midpoint of the n dimensional octahedron and pull it along
the positive and negative axis of the n+1 dimension.
</p>

<center><IMG width="398" height="205" SRC="hyperspace7.gif"></center><p>

<b>Pyramid</b><p>

<p align="justify">
To create a n+1 dimensional square based pyramid take the n dimensional cube
and pull the midpoint into the n+1 dimension.
</p>

<center><IMG width="456" height="191" SRC="hyperspace8.gif"></center><p>

<b>Prism</b><p>

<p align="justify">
A n+1 dimensional prism is the n dimensional cube with two opposite midpoints
pulled into the n+1 dimension.
</p>

<center><IMG width="456" height="248" SRC="hyperspace9.gif"></center><p>

<b>Display techniques</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The main visualization problem associated with 3D modelling is how to represent
a 3D scene on a medium with one fewer dimensions, ie: a computer screen or
piece of paper. This problem is made much more difficult for HyperSpace since
now we need to represent 4D objects on a medium with two fewer dimensions.
HyperSpace employs four fundamental techniques to solve this problem, they are
discussed below.
</p>

<b>Parallel Projections</b><p>

<p align="justify">
In order to visualize 3D objects on a 2D medium it is common to simply ignore
one coordinate. For example: ignore the z coordinate and draw the x and y
coordinates. Such a technique gives what are called parallel projections and
isometric projections of 3D objects. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
This technique can be used to represent 4D objects on a 2D medium, however in
this case we have to ignore two coordinates. For example: ignore the w and y
coordinates and draw only the x and z coordinates. This is what the xy
projection menu item in the view menu does.
One should be very wary about trying to visualize the geometry of a 4D object
by this technique. It is analogous to trying to visualize the geometry of a 3D
cube by projections of it onto a line.
</p>


<b>HyperCube examples</b><p>

<center><IMG width="457" height="154" SRC="hyperspace10.gif"></center><p>

<b>Elevations and plans</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Another technique employed to represent 3D objects on a 2D medium is to project
the object onto each coordinate plane, xy, xz, and yz.
</p>

<center><IMG width="127" height="118" SRC="hyperspace11.gif"></center><p>

<p align="justify">
This gives the common top/bottom (plan), front/back (elevation) and left/right
views of a 3D object. For example a simple 3D structure is shown below with the
projections onto the three coordinate planes.
</p>

<center><IMG width="430" height="248" SRC="hyperspace12.gif"></center><p>

<p align="justify">
This technique can be used for 4D objects except that there are six 2D
projection planes, namely wx, wy, wz, xy, xz, and yz. Each of these can be
displayed in the six views window shown below 
</p>

<center><IMG width="457" height="318" SRC="hyperspace13.gif"></center><p>

<p align="justify">
Note that the axes labels are placed in the top-left and bottom-right of each
view portion. The three view portions in the top left corner correspond to the
top, front, and side views in 3D.
For an unrotated HyperCube the six axis views are quite boring, they are all
squares. The following shows the 6 axis views if the HyperCube is rotated on
all planes.
</p>

<center><img width="443" height="442" src="hyperspace14.gif"></center><p>

<b>Slices</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The third technique used to represent 3D objects on a 2D medium is to contour
the object, effectively cutting slices along one coordinate axis. It is usual
in 3D to take the contours along the z axis but any axis will do. An arbitrary
slicing plane may also be used or alternatively the contours can always be with
respect to one axis and the object rotated in order to obtain arbitrary slicing
planes. 
This process essentially removes one dimension, so slicing a 3D object results
in a series of 2D curves. the contour lines.
To contour 4D objects we will choose to always slice along the w axis. Removing
one dimension from 4D objects results in a series of 3D objects which can be
projected by any of the classical techniques.
</p>

The window for 9 slices is shown below<p>

<center><IMG width="457" height="318" SRC="hyperspace15.gif"></center><p>

<p align="justify">
The window for different numbers of slices simply partitions the window into
smaller view portions. The axes labels are shown, the w axes is the one along
which the slices are taken, the y axes is ignored (projected onto the x-z
plane).
Nine slices of the HyperCube are shown below. It doesn't seem that difficult to
imagine each of the solids below.....the problem comes when you need to stack
them up together in the 4th dimension.
</p>

<center><IMG width="443" height="441" SRC="hyperspace16.gif"></center><p>

<b>Depth Cue</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The last technique which can be used in conjunction the others is to shade the
edges according to the value of one coordinate. In the HyperSpace application,
points with a large y coordinate may be shaded red, points with a small y may
be shaded blue and all points in between are coloured with the appropriate
intermediate hue.
</p>

<center><IMG width="442" height="442" SRC="hyperspace17.gif">
<p>
<IMG width="442" height="443" SRC="hyperspace18.gif"></center><p>

<b>Rotating the object</b><p>

<p align="justify">
When viewing an object using a computer aided design package there are two
operations which can be useful. They are: rotate the camera about the object or
rotate the object about its centre. There are subtle differences between the
two approaches,  the HyperSpace application implements rotation of object about
any one of the coordinate axis.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Considering the situation in 3D, there are three axes, x,y, and z about which
an object can be rotated. Alternatively there can be considered to be three
planes through which an object may be rotated. The two descriptions are
identical, the only difference is in how they are described. So, for example,
rotation about the x axis is the same as rotation in the y-z plane, rotation
about the y axis is rotation in the x-z plane and rotation about the z axis is
rotation in the x-y plane. The rotation plane is the terminology used here.
</p>

<table width=100% cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign="top">
In 4D there are six planes though which an object can be rotated. The amount of
rotation in each plane is specified with the rotate controls window shown below.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Each of the six sliders ranges from -180 degrees at the top to 180 degrees at
the bottom. By clicking on the arrows the angle varies by one degree intervals,
by clicking in the grey region the angle varies in 10 degree steps. If the
slider reaches the bottom of the scale it will wrap around to the top and
similarly when the slider reaches the top it will wrap around to the bottom,
ie: -190 degree rotation = 180 degree rotation.
With dimension set to 3 the first three sliders are disabled.

<b>Reading models from a file</b><p>

<p align="justify">
It is possible to use HyperSpace to view other 4 dimensional objects. To do
this a specially formatted text file must be created describing the geometry.
This file is opened with the read menu item in the file menu. The format will
be described below but it should be stressed that the format must be closely
adhered to if HyperSpace is to correctly read the object geometry.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The text file consists of three sections, they are: the vertex description, the
edge description, and finally the face description. Each section starts with
the number of elements in that section, for example, the vertex section starts
with the number of vertices that will follow, the edge section starts with the
number of edges to follow, similarly for the faces.
<p>

<p align="justify">
Vertices: Each vertex appears on a line by itself and consists of four floating
point numbers representing the w,x,y,z coordinates.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Edges: Each line of the edge description contains two numbers representing the
vertex numbers of the endpoints of the edge.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Faces: Each line of the face description consists of five numbers. The first is
the number of vertices in the face, it may be either 3 or 4. The remaining
numbers are the vertex numbers making up the face. All four vertex numbers must
be specified even if they are not used, the unused vertex number could be 0, it
will be ignored in any case.
<p>

<p align="justify">
The vertices and edges must be present for any object description but the faces
information is optional. If the faces are not specified then the number of
faces must be set to 0. Note however that without faces the slicing method of
visualization will not work.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This format is the one generated when the save menu item is used in the file
menu.
An example of a correctly formatted file is shown below<p>
<pre>5
-1 -1 -1 1

3 4 1 2 0
3 4 1 3 0
3 4 0 2 0
3 4 0 3 0</pre>

<p align="justify">
This object contains 5 vertices, 10 edges, and 10 faces. Note from the edge
list that the vertex numbers start from 0 not 1, so the vertex numbers in the
edge and face list range from 0 to 4 not from 1 to 5. The face list consists of
only 3 point faces, the fourth column must be present but it is only considered
for 4 point faces.
</p>

<p align="justify">
While all the numbers above are integers floating point numbers are equally
valid. The separators between each number can be any "white" character, most
commonly spaces or tabs would be used. This makes it possible to create these
files with basic programs, spreadsheets, word processors, etc.

Regular polytopes or platonic solids are convex solids (closed)
where all the building blocks (vertices, edges, faces, hyperfaces)
have the same characteristics. That is, vertices have the same number
of neighbours, edges are all the same length, polygons are all the
same shape and area, and hyperfaces have the same volume.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In <b>2 dimensions</b> there an infinity of regular polytopes. For example, a
circle can be approximated by polygons with 2 edges (line), 3 edges (triangle), 
4 edges (square), 5 edges, 6 edges ..... indeed any number of edges.
In 2 dimensions, every regular polytope is its own <a href="index.html#dual">dual</a>.
</p>

<p align=justify">
In <b>3 dimensions</b> there are just 5, these are typically known as the

In 3 dimensions, the tetrahedron is <a href="index.html#self-dual">self-dual</a>. 
The dual of the cube is
the octahedron. And the dual of the dodecahedron is the icosahedron.

example, all the regular polytopes in 2 dimensions. In 3 dimensions the
tetrahedron is self-dual.
Obviously for a polytope to be self-dual it must have the same number
of cells as vertices.

These files are formatted as follows, hopefully the description below
along with an example from above will give all the information needed to
translate the geometry into other formats. For more information see
<a href="../../dataformats/vef/index.html">VEF format</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>The first line contains the number of vertices<br>
<li>The next lines (one for each vertex) contain 4 numbers, each consists
	of the 4 floating point numbers being the w,x,y,z coordinate of that 
	vertex. The line number (counting from 0) is the vertex ID.<br>
<li>The next line contains the number of edges<br>
<li>The subsequent lines describe each edge, each consists of two
   vertex IDs making up that edge.<br>
<li>The next line contain the number of faces<br>
<li>The subsequent lines describe each face. The first number of each line 
	is the number of vertices in the face. The rest of the line contains
	a list of vertex IDs making up that face.
</ul>
