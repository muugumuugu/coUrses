<h1>Uniform vector on sphere given rotation angles</h1>

The following is a quick note on the random rotation of a vector in 3D such that 
the distribution on the surface of a sphere is uniform.
The coordinate system for this document is right handed as shown below, we will
start with a vector along the z axis and wish to find rotation angles and axes
that give the uniform distribution on the sphere of the resulting vector.

A naive way may be to imagine just choosing three angles, one for each axis and each
ranging from 0 to 2&pi;. However this leads to a higher density of points along the
equator.

One might then realise that rotating by all three axes is not necessary, one can cover
the sphere with just a rotation about 2 axes. For example, a rotation about the x axis
by a uniformly distributed random angle between 0 and pi, and a rotation about the z axis by 
a uniformly distributed random angle from 0 to 2&pi;
However, this leads to a higher density of point at the two poles.

The solution is to modify the first rotation about the x axis, specifically as follows,
where u is uniform random distribution on the range 0 to 1.
