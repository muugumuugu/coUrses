The following will discuss and illustrate various solids that result
from the intersection of cylinders. By no means will all cases be
covered but some Povray code will be provided (see later) that will
allow for personal exploration.
</p>

<b>Plus</b> (Two cylinders)<p>
Two perpendicular cylinders.

This is known as a Steinmetz solid, the surface area
is 16r<sup>2</sup> and the volume is 16r<sup>3</sup>/3. This result was known as
far back as 500BC by the Chinese astronomer and mathematician Tsu Ch'ung Chi
who also calculated pi to 6 decimal places, namely 355/113.
The PovRay scene file that generated the above is:
<a href="scene.pov">scene.pov</a> and <a href="scene.ini">scene.ini</a>.

<b>Tetrahedron</b> (4 cylinders)<p>
Cylinders through each vertex and the opposite face.<br>
This is the same as cylinders through the opposite vertices of a cube.<br>
Please note that in these and subsequent images
the left and right images don't necessarily have the same 
viewing position, the exact views have been chosen based upon their highest illustrative
value.

<b>Povray files</b><br>

The following Povray model file will allow the reader to experiment with these
volumes: <a href="cylinder.pov">cylinder.pov</a> and 
<a href="cylinder.ini">cylinder.ini</a>. It will be left as an exercise for the
reader to work out how I achieved the face outlines with Povray :-).

<b>Random cylinders</b><p>
As the number of cylinders increases the result is increasingly spherical, the
following is the result from 100 randomly orientated (and randomly coloured) cylinders.

The "lines" that seem to run around the sphere (great circle lines) arise when
two of the randomly placed cylinders are almost coincident.

<h1>Steinmetz solid</h1>

<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
The solid that results from the intersection of two cylinders (circular
cross section) of the same radius and at right angles to each other
is known as the Steinmetz solid.
</p>
<center><img src="steinmetz1.jpg" width=423 height=311></center><p>

The intersection is as follows<p>
<center><img src="steinmetz2.jpg" width=446 height=399></center><p>

<p align="justify">
The surface area is 16 r<sup>2</sup> where r is the cylinder radius.
The volume is 16 r<sup>3</sup> / 3.

<h1>What object is a circle in plan, front and side views? </h1>
<h3>(Besides a sphere)</h3>
</a>
or
<b>What is the resulting geometry from the intersection of three cylinders?</b>
<p>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>

<p><br><p>

<b>Question. 
Is a 3D object uniquely described by a plan, front and side view? <br>
Answer: No!</b> <p>

<p align="justify">
The object described here has the same plan, front and side view as a sphere.
Both the sphere and this object have circles as projections in these 
three views.

The following image was generated using the RayShade rendering package. 
It is of three semitransparent orthogonal intersecting cylinders coloured red,
green, and blue.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="planelev.2.gif"></center><p>

<p align="justify">
The following shows the intersection solid of these three cylinders in plan,
and two elevations as well as an isometric view.

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The volume of the intersection is 8 (2 - sqrt(2)) r<sup>3</sup>, where
r is the radius of the cylinder. What is the volume of the whole object?
Knowing the volume of a cylinder (pi r<sup>2</sup> l) and the volume
of the Steinmetz solid (16 r<sup>3 </sup>/ 3)) then the volume can
be calculated using the three dimensional version of the inclusion-exclusion
principle, namely that:
</p>
<center>
Vol[union(A,B,C)] = Vol[A] + Vol[B] + Vol[C] -
Vol[intersection(A,B)] - Vol[intersection(A,C)] - Vol[intersection(B,C)]
 + Vol[intersection(A,B,C)]
</center><p>
<p align="justify">
So the volume is 3 pi r<sup>2</sup> l - 8 sqrt(2) r<sup>3</sup> where l
is the length of the cylinders.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I've had one of these made by carefully lathing a block of wood
three times. The result is an interesting object to hold, it contains
8 "corners" and yet if you put it on a slope it will roll!

Credit to the staff in the workshop at the Auckland University
School of Architecture, Property, and Planning for building this
model for me.
I originally designed this object because Architecture students would
ask me why the computer couldn't scan their plans and elevations and
automatically build a 3D model. This was the simplest demonstration
I could come up that there isn't enough information about a 3D object
in its plane projections.
