<h1>Polygonal tilings</h1>

<p align="justify">
The following presents polygonal tilings created for simulations requiring partitions
of a surface for research into connectivity in brain science. They are presented here
separately to document the way they were achieved which may be applicable to other
areas, and because they seem to give natural looking formations.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The basic algorithm outline starts with a regular connectivity of either a triangular,
square, or hexagonal (others are possible) mesh. These are represented as nodes, edges 
in terms of node ids, and polygons as list of edge ids. A user specified number of edges
are randomly removed, this of course generates polygons with a higher number of boundary
edges. The user may specify a maximum number of allowed polygon edges, additionally some
polygon lengths may be explicitly excluded. For example in the original application pentagons
were not allowed. The resulting mesh network is allowed to relax under the physical system
where nodes are modelled as electrically charged points
(they repelled each other) and edges are modelled as springs
which both repelled or attracted depending on the rest length of the spring.
The result is a network where edge lengths attempt to be constant length and
nodes attempt to be evenly separated (avoiding crossovers that would otherwise occur).
</p>

<p align="justify">
The three starting mesh types are presented below along with two frames, one immediately
after the edges are removed and one after the relaxation. In all these 3 cases only 500 edges are
removed and the removal is such that polygon lengths will not exceed 10 edges. 
Note that in the case of hexagons, the double height odd column offset arrangement
for the initial conditions is equivalent in the connectivity sense
to the more traditionally laid out hexagonal mesh.

<p align="justify">
It should be noted that not all possible polygon lengths are possible. For example, starting with
squares initially one can never form any polygon without first forming hexagons (by removing one
shared edge). Starting with hexagons one can only initially create 10 sided polygons. Other such
limitations on desired polygon length distributions will be left up to the reader to consider.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are a number of other issues that can arise from the straightforward random
deletion of edges. One of many examples is shown below, starting with a square grid and
removing random edges one can end up with so called "dangling edges", that is, edges not
Associated in a meaningful way with any polygon. In the current implementation these are
deleted after the edge removal stage, they could equally be precluded in the edge 
remove stage.

<b>Further examples</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Various examples are provided below varying the starting grid topology, the number of
deleted edges, and the maximum allowed polygon edge length. In the cases indicated by
"exhaustive edges removed", this indicates where edges are removed until no more can
be removed due to the maximum allowed polygon edge length.
