<h1>Conic Sections</h1>

<p align="justify">
If a cylinder is sliced by a plane a number of curves arise depending
on the angle of the plane with respect to the cylinder axis, these
are called conic sections. 
Conic sections were studied extensively by the Greeks as early as
350 BC in an attempt to solve the great geometric problems of the day,
namely, squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting an
angle. They were also studied extensively in relation to Keplers
laws of planetary motion by Descartes and Fermat.
There are
four different classes of curve (circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola)
and they are illustrated below.

<p align="justify">
The equations for each of the curves types (centered at the origin) 
are given on the right.
Note that the equations for the circle and ellipse are not dependent on
the axis, the parabola and hyperbola come in two variants depending
on whether they are aligned vertically or horizontally. 
</p>

<b>Nappes</b>
<p align="justify">
If the cone is imagined to extend until it goes to a point and then
enlarges again then the two cones are known as "nappes". A plane that
intersects just one nappe is either an ellipse or parabola, if it
intersects both nappes then it is a hyperbola.
</p>

<b>Focus</b>
<p align="justify">
The solid dots
on the right indicate the focus of each curve. For the ellipse the focus
distance is a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> and for the hyperbola it is
a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>.
</p>

<b>General equation</b>
<p align="justify">
The general equation of a conic section is given below.
</p>
<center>
A x<sup>2</sup> +
B x y +
C y<sup>2</sup> +
D x +
E y +
F = 0
</center>
<p align="justify">
The type of curve is dictated by the quantity B<sup>2</sup> - 4 A C.
If it is less than 0 the curve is an ellipse or circle.
If equal to 0 then a parabola, if greater than 0 then a hyperbola.
</p>

<!-- Doesn't seem to be true.
<b>Stretching</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Note that in general if a conic section is stretched along an axis
other than a principle axis then the resulting curve is no longer a
conic section. For example if an ellipse is rotated in the plane
and then stretched along the x axis the resulting curve can no longer
be described by the equation of another (rotated) ellipse.
