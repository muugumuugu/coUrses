I will define the dürehedron here
as a specific configuration of a more general 3D polyhedra
created as the bounding volume between 6 angled planes and a further two planes performing a
cut at the top and bottom. The 6 angled planes are two in groups, an upper and lower
group, the lower group being the mirror image of the upper group and rotated by 60
degrees. Each of the groups consist of three planes orientated at some angle to the
vertical (typically around 30 degrees) and rotated about the vertical axis by 
intervals of 120 degrees. The result is a solid with 6 five sided "kite-like" faces
(rhombi) and two triangular faces, one at each of the vertical extreme.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The dürehedron can be characterised by two values, the cutoff height and the angle of the
inclined planes to the vertical. The two poles shown along the vertical are determined by
where the inclined planes intersect.

Also variously known as a truncated triangular trapezohedron or truncated rhombohedron.
The general form is representative of a calcite crystal.
Also referred by a Joachim Camerarius, a contemporary, of Dürer as a
quadratum saxum.
</p>

<p align="justify">
An interesting feature of the solid is that irrespective of the values of cut distance
and tilt angle, the sum of the internal angles of the 5 sided faces is always 540 degrees.
The top and bottom caps are, from symmetry, equilateral triangles with internal angles
of 60 degrees.

Historically Dürers solid (1471-1528) is from the representation in
an engraving by Albrecht Dürer titled Melancholia I., hence the use of his name in
the naming of the more general shape here. The exact proportions of the solid
in the engraving is not documented, neither is it obvious.

<p align="justify">
In trying to determine the exact proportions of this early engraving researchers
have focused on the angle of the acute corner of the rhombus. Various suggestions
have been proposed, the most common being one of 54, 60, 72, 80 and even 90 degrees.
In the case of 90 degrees the shape degenerates to a cube truncated by planes
perpendicular to the long diagonal, certainly the simplest explanation.
While the solid in the engraving does not appear cubic, it has been suggested
that it has simply been stretched in the vertical axis. That is, a trigonal trapezohedron
truncated by planes perpendicular to the long axis.

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
Note that only specifying 
the angle at the acute rhombus corner does not uniquely define the solid,
another parameter is needed to define the height of the top and bottom cutting plane.
Some researchers have used the height from the acute angle of the rhombus to the
midpoint of the opposite edge as this second parameter.
</p>

<p align="justify">
An acute rhombus angle of 54 degrees is quoted by some as special, and a characteristic
of the "philosophers stone".
In this case the other rhombus angles are 126 and 117 degrees exactly.

   <font size=-1>54 degree angle at acute rhombus corner, plane angle 17.1 degrees</font>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
There is another special case when the acute angle is 72 degrees,
the other rhombus angles are 108 and 126 degrees exactly.

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
It has been proposed by some that the solid in the etching has all the vertices lying on
the surface of a sphere. This is not a unique situation and one example is illustrated
below with a cutting height of 0.811 and plane angle of 23.774 degrees.
