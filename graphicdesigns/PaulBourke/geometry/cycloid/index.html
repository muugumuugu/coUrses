<h1>Cycloid Curve</h1>

Everyone has witnessed a rolling wheel or tyre, have you ever stopped to
wonder what curve is traced out by a point on the rim of the wheel?
Such a curve is called a cycloid. Consider the circle below of radius "r".

The equation for the curve traced out is given by:
</p>
<center>
<table><tr><td>
x = r (theta - sin(theta))<br>
y = r (1 - cos(theta))
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
This can is derived by noting that the distance between a and b is the
arc (r theta). So x = distance a -&gt; b, minus distance c -&gt; b.
This second term is r sin(theta). The height y = r - r cos(theta).
