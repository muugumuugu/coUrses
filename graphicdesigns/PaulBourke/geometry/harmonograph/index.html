The two pendulum <b>harmonograph</b> draws attractive patterns that arise
from drawing the relative path traversed by two swinging masses as their
motion is slowly damped.
The resulting figures are called <b>harmonograms</b> or sometimes a
<b>Lissajous curve</b>.

The harmongraph was pioneered by the French physicist, Jules Antoine 
Lissajous in 1857. The first harmonograph actually used a light beam on a 
screen instead of the pens on paper that are used today. Following the 
invention of the harmonograph it became a very popular device and was 
found in many homes. After the early 1900s it decreased in popularity 
and is rarely seen today.

Another device also called an harmonograph since it produces the same
essential motion is based upon a platform suspended by  each corner.
The platform can be swung and twisted and a stationary pen draws a trace
on some paper attached to the platform. Weights are often located at
various positions on the table to produce different oscillatory 
patterns.
One of the largest harmonographs of this kind can be found in the 
Science Centre and Planetarium, Wollongong, Australia.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Andrew Purdam has produced equations that allow one to explore the
beauty of the harmongraph without building one....not that building one
is any less satisfying. His equations are:
</p>
<center>
x(t) = A<sub>x</sub>(t) sin(w<sub>x</sub> t + p<sub>x</sub>)
     + A<sub>s</sub>(t) sin(w<sub>s</sub> t + p<sub>s</sub>)
</center>
<p>
<center>
y(t) = A<sub>y</sub>(t) sin(w<sub>y</sub> t + p<sub>y</sub>)
</center>
<p align="justify">
All initial amplitudes, 
frequencies (w) and phases (p) should be different and not integer
multiples for the most complicated (interesting) patterns.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In order for the amplitude to decay (not necessary but occurs in the
real harmonograph) the amplitudes can decay as follows, where d is typically
a suitable small positive number. This gives an exponential decay function.
</p>
<center>
A(t) = A(t-1) (1 - d)

The results can be seen in the photos.  (I was even inspired by
the old-looking wooden case, with "Harmonograph" stencilled on the lid, in
the background of one of Paul's photos, and built a similar case for ours.
We've made several refinements since the first iteration;  you'll notice in
one of the photos, we're using barbell weights for the pendulums.  (or is it
pendulii?)  The barbell weights worked fine as far as the weight went,
however, their diameter was too large, and in some cases would strike the
legs, when the pendulum was swung too vigorously.  We subsequently cast lead
weights from waste tire balance weights.  We also have experimented with
different lengths of pipe for the top and bottom halves of the pendulum
shafts.

My son, Richard, became interested in harmonographs about 3 or 4 years ago.
I found him in the basement one evening, attempting to suspend a piece of
plywood on 4 strings attached to the floor joists above. He'd seen a diagram
or photo of a harmonograph that worked in that manner on the internet.   I
didn't really understand what he was trying to do, but a friend who was
visiting had seen a harmonograph when he was a child, and was enthusiastic.
The board-on-a-string attempt fizzled, and harmonographs were kind of
forgotten.   Some time later, Richard found a photo of a museum's
harmonograph on a web site and showed it to me, along with some patterns
traced by mathematical harmonograph models (Lissajous curves).  The
photograph he showed me was the "board-on-a-string" type, but I think he had
seen Paul Bourke's web site photos, and attempted to describe it to me.  He
could not find the site again, however.  But the patterns looked interesting
to me, and convinced me he was seriously interested in harmonographs--it was
not just a passing fancy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I began looking around the internet, but found little of practical interest.
I looked on Amazon.com for books about harmonographs.  I found virtually
nothing.  Then one day, I found Paul Bourke's web site, and the photographs
that I suspect are the only ones of their type on the internet.  I liked the
"old-fashioned", mechanical nature of that instrument, and e-mailed Mr.
Bourke about it.  Unfortunately, he no longer had access to the
harmonograph, so my questions about measurements, materials, and so forth
could not be answered.  He generously provided what information he could,
and that got me started.  At first, I thought I could "cheat", and make a
simple gimbal.  I sawed a section of 1-1/2 inch square steel thin-wall
tubing, used some thin sheet metal to make supports for this gimbal. 
It didn't work very well at all, for a number of reasons.
</p>

<a href="rick2.html">

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
So I decided to scale the photograph in Mr. Bourke's web site as best I
could, to get some measurements for building the thing.  I printed a large
photo of the harmonograph, and using the basic measurement of the pen I
intended to use for our harmonograph, scaled the entire instrument
photograph to the pen's measurements.  I was not trying for a perfect
replication, merely a functional one.  I used mahogany for the body, and as
much brass hardware as I could, to make it look old and Victorian, and as
attractive as possible.  I'd love to use brass rods for the pendulum shafts,
brass billets for the weights, and brass turnings for the gimbals and base
rings, but have to draw the line somewhere!  Brass stock is
expensive around here.  And, of course, who wants to keep all that brass
polished up?
</p>

<p align="justify">
I had most of the instrument completed for Richard's 18th birthday, and I
think he was surprised and pleased with his gift.  He and I worked together
to complete the instrument.

<b>Contribution by Ed Mattson</b><p>
<p align="justify">
I was captivated as a child by a harmonograph at the old Oregon Museum of 
Science and Industry. It was a simple affair consisting of two giant 
pendulums hanging from the ceiling. I remember being frustrated 
because it was so popular I had to queue for ages to use it and not have 
time to see many of the other exhibits.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Later, as an adult, I made a similar device that hung from the floor 
joists in my basement. As I was making my living as a woodworker at the 
time, I realised there was probably a market for such a fascinating 
device and a chance to wed it with some fancy woodworking. The 
problem was that I needed to think of a way to make something that 
did not have to be hung from a wall or ceiling because of the 
liability for a smashed foot if it were improperly installed.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I finally thought of a way to make it entirely free-standing and 
portable. My first prototypes used crude home-made gimbals made from 
large washers with drilled dimples which rested on hardened screw 
points. With a little out-of-box thinking I realised the gimbals 
need not be at the top of the pendulums but could be in the middle, 
causing the drawing modules at the top to move in opposite direction 
from the weights at the bottom. Placing the pen arm and paper tray at the 
top also put the "business end" at an ideal height closer to the user.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the initial prototypes, the main problem to overcome was the forces 
generated by the heavy, swinging weights in the pendulums. Each had 
about 23kg of lead (which I melted down from shot) plus the weight of the 
pendulum structure and heavy wooden boxes that sealed the lead from the 
outside world. This led me to replace gimbals with captured automotive 
u-joints, which were far more stable and were inexpensive. They added a 
slightly greater decay factor, but the pendulum weight was sufficient to 
make this negligible.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The other problem to overcome was the twisting and stress on the whole 
frame structure. I wanted to make it knock-down for portability but also 
easy to assemble without the use of a lot of tools. This required a certain 
mass in the various parts, but I avoided too much mass by coming up with a 
system of strong friction joints that were held together with knock-in 
wedges. The whole thing can be completely assembled and disassembled with 
just a mallet.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The joints loosen slightly and slowly with use, but require just a tap on the 
wedges every couple weeks or so to tighten things back up. Also, there was 
just enough flexibility in the frame to have an unexpected effect. The 
energy of each pendulum transfers through the frame just enough to effect the 
other pendulum (both dampening and amplifying) and alter the pattern of the 
drawn curves.
</p>

<center>
   <img src="mattson.jpg" border=1 width=500 height=347>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
For visual effect, I wanted all these joints to have a sort of exposed, 
complex, high-tech look and the wood itself also had to be attractive but 
strong. I used some high quality, figured walnut which is plentiful in 
Oregon. I worked hard on an overall visual effect to complement the 
actual function of the machine.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I demonstrated the harmonograph at two of the annual shows put on by the 
Guild of Oregon Woodworkers but was not prepared for the response! It 
drew huge crowds and gasps of wonder as it did its magical thing. Much 
time was spent with crowd control and device protection - especially 
from the excited kids! I lost count of the number of reams of paper of 
finished drawings given out. It was not just the drawing itself but the 
harmonious and mesmerising interaction of the parts of the machine that 
fascinated people as it swung away and drew the curves. The crowds were 
literally and unconsciously swaying in unison as they stood watching.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I got a real chuckle as I overheard two elderly guys down on their 
knees inspecting and discussing the mechanics. They were saying things 
like, "The gyroscopes have to be in the boxes here but I just can't 
figure out how he's hidden the electronics." I just bit my tongue and 
pretended not to hear. Why deprive them of the mystery?
