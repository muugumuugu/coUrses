<h1>World Wide Telescope:<br>Fisheye and spherical mirror projection</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>

<p align="justify">
The following is a discussion from tests of the WWT (World Wide Telescope) software
and in particular its handling of projection using a fisheye lens or
<a href="../index.html">spherical mirror</a> and the
warp maps that describe how to distort fisheye images for this projection
technique. This is not an endorsement of the product for its intended
users but simply a test/evaluation of the fisheye generation and optional warping.

The most positive aspect is that it employs the standard warp maps as used
by the <a href="../warpplayer/index.html">warp-on-the-fly movie player</a>, supported by the custom mesh 
generator, and (hopefully) becoming a defacto standard for software in this area. 
This means that sites who have gone through the process of creating a 
<a href="../meshmapper/index.html">precise warp mesh</a> for their configuration can use that directly
with this software. It should also be noted that warp maps can also be used to
create modified fisheye images for truncated fisheye lens systems and to correct for
radial distortion in other fisheye lens products.

The tests performed here are in an 
<a href="../iDome/index.html">upright dome</a> called the iDome a very differently orientated
dome to a planetarium.
In a way this shows the power of the use of warp maps, that is, the application
doesn't need to know anything about the projection hardware, that information is all embodied
in the mesh warp configuration file.

With a graphics card with two graphics connectors there are two ways of running
the software. One is to simply mirror the displays but this requires frequent
entering and exiting of fullscreen mode (f11) to toggle between a view of the
menus and fullscreen which is when the content is correct on the dome. The other
mode is to use both displays and employ the "Detach main view to second monitor".
This later options would seem the best approach.

As with all projection environments and particularly with dome projection it is
critical to perform a colour calibration. The key component of which is to
counteract the high gamma values of most digital data projectors.
<p>

<b>Notes and Issues</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
Slightly disappointing that there is no Mac version since that is the
traditional computer used with the iDome. Of course this is coming out of
MicroSoft Research, so fair enough.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
There is still some work to be done with polygon flashes which seem to be
related to the warping mesh rather than other content based textures.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The version at the date of testing was not entirely bug free. The main
consequence of problems was an unresponsive mouse/keyboard. It was also
clear that changing display characteristics while the program is running
is likely to fail.
