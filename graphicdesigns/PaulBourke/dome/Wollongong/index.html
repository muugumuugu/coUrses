<h3>Wollongong Science Centre iDome Exhibit</h3>
in conjunction with the
<h3>ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science</h3>
Filming/Visualisation/Production by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
July 2009<p>
Tour Guides: Simon Moulton (ACES), Willo Grosse (ACES), Gordon Wallace (ACES)<br>
Animation: Mats Bjorklund, Magipics (VIC)<br>
Molecular simulations: Mike Kuiper (VPAC)<br>
Directors: David Officer (ACES), Toni Campbell (ACES)

<p>

<p align="justify">
The following documents a project and interactive iDome installation at the Wollongong
Science Centre, supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science. 
It involves computer animation (by Mats Bjorklund, Magipics), 
computer simulations of molecular structures (by Mike Kuiper, VPAC),
molecular visualisation and LadyBug-3 filmed footage (by Paul Bourke, UWA). 
The exhibit is intended to convey, to the general public, a
sense of the research at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Material Science
(University of Wollongong). 
</p>

There are 8 sequences in total,
<dd>
1. A welcome to the centre.<br>
2. Nanostructured electromaterials.<br>
3. Carbon nanotubes.<br>
4. Graphene.<br>
5. Conducting polymers.<br>
6. Fibre spinning.<br>
7. Looking at the nanostructured world.<br>
8. An invitation to visit the centre.<br>

	User Interface.<p>
</center>

<p align="justify">
Except for the one animation sequence (Nanostructured electromaterials) by Mats Bjorklund, 
all the footage is created as full spherical
panoramic images. In the case of the filmed footage from the LadyBug-3 camera
the image only extends down to about -50 degrees, this conveniently matches
the truncated nature of the <a href="../iDome/index.html">iDome</a>.
While the video plays the user is able to look around the laboratory, in many
cases there are additional visualisations of the structures being discussed
composited into other portions of the spherical image.

<b>Technical information</b>
<p align="justify">
The entire experience is controlled with a large trackball and managed with
a Quartz Composer composition. The user navigates the menu interface (above),
selects a topic and watches and notionally navigates within 
the resulting movie or animation, at the end of
which the menu environment is returned to. At the highest resolution each
movie sequence is 4096x2048 pixels, for iDome environments with lower
resolution projectors 75% or 50% reduced versions may be more appropriate.

<p align="justify">
Depending on the exact geometry of the dome environment and the projector
being used the spherical image needs to be warped appropriately. This warping
is described by a mesh onto which the spherical projection is mapped, the
mesh is created in just the right way so that the image on the iDome surface
appears undistorted and natural to the viewer. This warping is performed in
realtime using the Quartz Composer "pbmesh" patch.
