<h1>Software Bisque and spherical mirror projection: A review</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
January 2009
<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
The following is the result of an exploration of the "Software Bisque" fulldome
products and their handling of projection using a 
<a href="../index.html">spherical mirror</a> and the
warp maps that describe how to distort fisheye images for this projection
technique. This is not an endorsement of the products for their intended
users but simply a test/evaluation of the fisheye warping.
The discussion here relates to capabilities in the "Theatre edition".
</p>

<p align="justify">
The most positive aspect is that they use the standard warp maps as used
by the <a href="../warpplayer/index.html">warp-on-the-fly movie player</a> and supported by the custom mesh 
generator. This means that sites who have gone through the process of
creating a 
<a href="../meshmapper/index.html">precise warp mesh</a> for their configuration can use that directly
with both Seeker and SkyX. The tests performed here are in an 
<a href="../iDome/index.html">upright dome</a>, not necessarily the natural choice for astronomy content, but in
a way this shows the power of the use of warp maps, that is, the application
doesn't need to know anything about the projection hardware and all tools
use the same mesh warp configuration file.

The selection of the warp map could not be simpler, see image below. In the tests
performed here an HD (1920x1080) projector is used and the dome and screen display
are in mirror mode.

<b>SkyX</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Unlike Seeker, SkyX was operated with distinct displays (not mirrored). The control
panels on the LCD display and the content fullscreen on the secondary display attached
to the projector.

<b>Notes and Issues</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
The selection of the warp map files expects an extension of ".map". This was
an early convention by the author but for various reasons 
they are now generally called ".data" files. No big deal
since the file can easily be duplicated and renamed but perhaps any text file
text file should qualify.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The distribution provides a truncated fisheye option, of course that and other
specialist configurations can also be dealt with warp maps.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
At the time of writing there seem to be some issues with the particular ATI
card being used. This resulted in stars being drawn incorrectly. The problem
was not exhibited with the same version of the software 
on a machine with an nVidia card. The seriousness of this
problem is unknown, users may choose to check the status of compatibility with
their particular graphics card.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
I repeat that the upright dome is not necessarily an ideal environment for astronomy
content, but one way to address some of the spatial issues is to rotate the horizon
by 90 degrees. Unfortunately it seems SkyX only presents one hemisphere, so doing
the rotation while possible results in no graphics on the lower half of the iDome.
Not an issue for a "standard" planetarium dome, could be an issue for a tilted dome.
