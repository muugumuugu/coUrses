<i>
The exhibition is the culmination of years of work by Traditional Owners of the Ngintaka Tjukurpa who collaborated with archaeologists, anthropologists, film-makers and Museum staff to create a remarkable storytelling experience for the public.

The exhibition tells the story of the giant Wati Ngintaka, the Perentie Lizard man, who travels across the APY Lands creating landforms and food sources in his epic quest for a superior grindstone. In 1988 Traditional Owners decided to share the open version of this story with a wider non-Indigenous audience.

In 1994 they invited Traditional Owners from across the APY Lands to an Inma Festival, a celebration of dance and song, where they professionally recorded the Ngintaka Inma and story. The Anangu Elders aim was to record the Songline for their children and grandchildren to listen to after they passed on, and enable the wider non-Indigenous community to gain a greater understanding of Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara culture.
