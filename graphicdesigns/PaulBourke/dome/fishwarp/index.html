<b>Short history and older software by the author</b><p>
<p align="justify">
In 2003 the author developed the idea of using a spherical mirror for fulldome projection
instead of the much more expensive fisheye lens options. Initially fisheye movies were
pre-warped but it was quickly realised that was not a sensible approach, rather the fisheye
movie should be warped during playback.
Fortunately this is something that is straightforward
for the graphics cards of the time and now.
In 2005 the <a href="../warpplayer/index.html">warpplayer</a> software was developed
to do exactly that, for Apple Macs. Later in 2013, a modified version of
<a href="../VLCwarp/index.html">VLC</a> was created
that supports real-time warping and was available for Mac and Windows.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Unfortunately the above two solutions are showing their age and the realities of the
technology they were built on means they are difficult to maintain. On the Mac at least,
the following is an attempt to bring things up to date and base the solution on a more
stable and future-proof (as far as one can) footing.
</p>


<b>Before purchasing</b><p>
<p align="justify">
All the playback solutions below have demonstration versions, PLEASE download and test these before
purchasing.
If for some reason the demo version does not work for you please contact the author.
Please be advised that some of the downloads are rather large, this
is due to the inclusion of short fisheye movies for testing purposes.
</p>

<b>Licensing</b><p>

<ul>
<li>Purchasing one of the solutions below entitles you to the whole set and the meshmapper application.<br>
<li>The license is for a single computer, please respect this.<br>
<li>Please contact the author for a quotation if you require licenses for multiple machines or clients.<br>

<b>Fisheye Movie Player</b>
</td></tr></table><p>

<b>Introduction</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The following documents a new (2019) Apple Mac
fisheye movie playback solution for planetariums
using a spherical mirror projection system.
It is intended to replace the older, and less featured, 
<a href="../warpplayer/index.html">WarpPlayer</a> application.
It includes a simple control pane to select between different user installed fisheye movies,
volume control, fisheye positioning, pause/play button and a preview on the operator console.
And of course it allows one to supply a custom warp mesh for precise warping.
</p>

<b>Display settings</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The software expects two displays, the primary display identified by having the Apple
menu bar along the top, and a secondary display attached to the data projector. These displays
should not be mirrored, the settings accessed from the system preferences are shown below.
</p>
<center>
	<a href="fisheyemovie1.png">
	<img src="fisheyemovie1_s.png" width=800 height=391 border=0></a>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
Note that in general the two displays will not be the same size. The secondary display will
typically be either 1920x1080 or 1920x1200, the primary display will be whatever the
laptop or iMac screen resolution is.
</p>

<b>Player controls</b><p>
<p align="justify">
When the player application is run, two windows will be created. 
One window will be on the secondary
display, it will be full screen and it is where the warped movie will play (on the data projector).
The other window will appear on the primary display, it will not be full screen, it contains
the movie controls and will appear as follows although the movie name and preview rectangle
will obviously reflect other movies than the two examples shown here.
</p>

<center>
   <a href="fisheyemovie2.png">
	<img src="fisheyemovie2.png" width=600 height=599 border=1></a>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The meaning of the items on this window should be obvious. 
The fisheye movie is previewed in the lower rectangle,
the image on the secondary display is the warped version of this. The sound volume slider
shown is a multiplier on the system sound levels, so when the slider is all the way
to the right then the system sound level will be in effect.
When the slider is all the way to the left then there will be no audio.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In this example, the image on the secondary display will appear as follows, namely the
warped version of the fisheye movie.
</p>
<center>
   <a href="fisheyemovie3.png">
	<img src="fisheyemovie3_s.png" width=800 height=449 border=1></a>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
This approach of using the secondary display facilitates seamless presentations. That is,
one can launch the different tools independently without the audience seeing anything
strange occuring between them, for example: menus bars, other windows, etc.
The control pane on the operators screen would normally be invisible to the audience.
</p>

<b>Warp Mesh</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Any projection using a spherical mirror requires a description of how the fisheye is
warped, such that after passing through the optical system (projector and mirror) the
result on the dome looks correct. This is described by a mesh (vertices and texture
coordinates) and stored in a so called <a href="../../dataformats/meshwarp/index.html">warpmesh file</a>.
Ideally a warp mesh is created specifically for each installation since the warping
required will depend on the exact geometry/optics. A tool for calibrating a particular 
installation is <a href="../meshmapper/index.html">meshmapper</a> and is provided with this application. 
Some installations find they can
use a generic warpmesh and adjust the geometry/optics to match.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Correct warping depends not on the resolution of the projector but only on the aspect
ratio, the ratio of the width to height in pixels. 
Two versions of this software are supplied for the two most common aspect ratios suited
to spherical mirror projection, namely 16x9 and 16x10. 16x9 is suitable for projectors of
resolution 1920x1080 and 1280x720, although the later is not recommended by the author.
The most common 16x10 aspect ratio is for projectors with a resolution of 1920x1200
(UXGA+) and 2560x1600 (WQXGA). 
Other common data projection aspect ratios are 4x3 and 5x4, but these are not recommended
for spherical mirror projection due to low pixel efficiency.
Readers are asked to contact the author if they require
 a version of the software for a different aspect ratio, or for higher resolution projectors
such as WQXGA, 4K, and UHD.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In order to use a site specific
specific warping the warp mesh file should be named "warpmap.data" and
placed in the package contents for the app. This is achieved by right mouse clicking
(or control-click on laptop touch panels) on the
application icon and choosing "Show Package Contents" from the pop-up menu, see below.
</p>

<center>
	<img src="fisheyemovie4.png" width=369 height=531 border=1>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The result, after expanding the Contents and Resources folders will look like the following,
simply replace the warpmap.data file with the one designed for your particular set-up by
the company you purchased the system from, or as a result of running the meshmapper
calibration.
</p>

<center>
	<img src="fisheyemovie5.png" width=548 height=450 border=1>
</center><p>

<b>Movies</b>
<p align="justify">
This fisheye movie player allows one to play any one of a number of movies. The movies that
appear upon clicking the "Previous movie" and "Next movie" button are the ones found
in the movies directory, also located in the Contents and Resources folder. To create your own
playlist simply copy the movies you wish to play into that directory, as an example two
short fisheye movies are supplied, see below.
</p>
<center>
	<img src="fisheyemovie6.png" width=548 height=450 border=1>
</center><p>

<b>Navigation</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
On occasion it is useful to be able to rotate the fisheye on the dome, this can be accomplished
by holding the shift key down and moving the mouse left and right.
<p>
<li><p align="justify">
If you decide you want to play a movie (or two) on the spur of the moment
and you haven't already copied it into the movies directory, you can simply drag/drop
the movie onto the control pane. That movie or movies will then appear at the end of
the movie list.
</p>
</ul><p>

<b>Test before buying</b><p>
<p align="justify">
To test before buying please download one of the following demonstration versions.
These are full featured except the  movie is converted to greyscale the words "Demo version" are added.
Please report problems with the demonstration version to the author.

<b>360 Movie Player</b>
</td></tr></table><p>

<p align="justify">
The following operates essentially the same as the above except in this case it accepts
a 360 movie, as typically captured from one of the <a href="../../panorama/360video/index.html">360 movie</a> 
cameras on the market. The
format of the image is expected to an equirectangular projection, 360 degrees of longitude
and 180 degrees of latitude. The image should have a 2:1 aspect ratio, for example
</p>
<center>
   <img src="360movie1.jpg" width=800 height=400 border=1>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
This movie player assumes a spherical mirror based projection system.
If you have a fisheye lens projection system then the author is happy to produce a version for
you, but additional information is required such as the pixel radius of the fisheye projection.
Please contact the author for a version in this case, there is no additional cost for this customisation.
</p>

<b>Instructions</b>

<p align="justify">
The following assumes the reader is familiar with the documentation above for the fisheye
case, only the differences will be presented.
The expected display settings are the same as for the above. Namely two displays, the secondary connected
to the data projector.
The player controls are very similar, except now the preview shows the full equirectangular
frame instead of a fisheye.
</p>

<center>
   <a href="360movie2.png">
	<img src="360movie2_s.png" width=600 height=600 border=0></a>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The 360 movie is previewed in the lower rectangle,
the image on the secondary display is the warped version 
of an extracted fisheye view. See below for a description of how to interactively
move this fisheye selection.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In this example, the image on the secondary display will appear as follows.
</p>
<center>
   <a href="360movie3.png">
	<img src="360movie3_s.png" width=800 height=450 border=0></a>
</center><p>

<p align="justify">
Movies are added to the play list by adding them to the "360video" directory, again located in the 
Package Contents for the application. Alternatively to temporarily add movies to the playlist they
can be dragged onto the player controls window.
</p>
<center>
   <a href="360movie4.png">
	<img src="360movie4_s.png" width=400 height=338 border=1></a>
</center><p>

<b>Navigation</b><p>
<p align="justify">
There are an infinite number of fisheyes that can be extracted from an equirectangular. The best
can depend on the content and the orientation of the dome and/or seating. The arrow keys can be
used to shift the fisheye view, the left and right arrows change the longitude, the up and down arrows
change the latitude. Auto repeat is also supported for continuous movement. 
Alternatively one can shift the
fisheye by holding the shift key and moving the mouse while the player control window is active.
Note that fast movement can be disorientating, smooth gradual movement is recommended.
</p>

<b>Warning</b><p>
<p align="justify">
360 movies can be much more compute/graphics demanding than fisheye movies. For one thing,
for the same resolution they are twice the size. In addition to the warping required,
which is the same as for the fisheye player, in this case the fisheye needs to be first
extracted. As such, the computer power required for smooth playback may be more demanding.

The following is in the same style as the two players above except this expects to
play a standard (non-fisheye) movie on a section of the dome. Conceptually the movie
is playing on a plane that is tangential to the  hemispherical dome surface, it is tilted
at some angle and a certain distance away.

<b>Fisheye movie pre-warp (EXPERIMENTAL)</b>
</td></tr></table><p>

<p align="justify">
The following tool allows one to create a prewarped version of a fisheye movie, suitable say, for playing
from a low end device such as a media player. Note that in general the author does strongly recommends not
creating prewarped versions of fisheye movies for other purposes, much better to 
<a href="#fisheye">warp live on the fly</a>.
One reason for discouraging 
this is that a pre-warped movie only really suits a specific geometric/optical setup and
as such cannot result in a correct warp across different dome installations.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Unlike the previous <a href="../tgawarp/">pipeline</a> by the author
this tool does the movie conversion without the need to extract the movie frames, warp them individually
and then reassemble the movie. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The operation of the tool is quite straightforward. A movie should be drag-dropped onto the conversion
application window, shown below. The start button should be pressed at which stage the conversion process will
start, the application will quit when complete. The converted movie will have the same name as the original
movie except with the word "_warped" appended.  This warped movie will be saved to the Desktop.
The movie will be either H.264 (the default) or H.265 if that
option is chosen, the movie will use the .mov container and extension.

The tool is supplied with sample warp mesh files for
the two most common aspect ratios for spherical mirror projection. The instructions for using a custom
warp mesh is described for the other players listed above.

<b>Note on MOV</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The tool above has been created primarily for Apple Macs, hence the choice of MOV as the movie
container. It is accepted that this is not always the container of choice for Windows machines.
It is quite easy to convert from MOV to mp4 (for example) in a lossless way by using the free
ffmpeg software (there are lots of other ways as well but many/most will involve an undesirable
recompression.

<b>Customisation</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The author is prepared to consider customised versions of the tools here, or new features.
If you have feature requests feel free to send them by email. If multiple people ask for the same
feature then it may be implemented in the future. Alternatively you may wish to commission
a new feature or other customisation. The cost of any customisation will depend on the degree
of difficulty and whether you require exclusive rights or if it can be shared with the
community.
