<h1>EON - Eye of Nagaur</h1>
Conceived by Sarah Kenderdine and Jeffrey Shaw<br>

<p align="justify">
The following documents the development of an application used
in an interactive digital installation 
called the "Eye of Nagaur", conceived by Sarah Kenderdine and 
Jeffrey Shaw. The application developed is a 3D interface to 16 very high
resolution spherical panoramic images from the 
Ahhichatragarh Fort at Nagaur in Rajasthan. Each panorama is additionally
augmented with traditional music created with a range of local instruments.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The user is presented with an aerial view of the fort complex and the 16
spherical panoramic images arranged as a circular "pearl necklace". One can
navigate to any of the panorama nodes by rotating the necklace and clicking
on the highlighted pearl.

<p align="justify">
Upon selecting a particular panoramic image one flies into the pearl where the
full resolution image is presented. One can then pan and zoom around at that
position within the fort.

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The entire application is created in the Unity3D game engine. When on the outside
of the pearl low resolution versions of the panoramic images are wrapped onto a 
sphere. Upon entering a sphere a high resolution version of the panoramic image
is faded in. This approach is necessary since a 16Kx8K image require 512K of texture memory,
clearly most graphics cards would not support 16 of these in texture memory at once.

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
Upon entering a pearl the camera is surrounded by a cube map, each face of the cube
consists of a 4x4 array of textured meshes. Each individual mesh is textured with a
1Kx1K texture, so a total of 4K per face, and 16K (horizontally) per cube. The scripting in Unity
is used to enable/disable the appropriate cubes as the camera enters/leaves the
pearls.

<p align="justify">
The native resolution of each panorama is on average 16000 pixels providing the
range of zoom illustrated below.
