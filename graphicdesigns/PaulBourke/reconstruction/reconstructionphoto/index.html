<h1>Guiding notes for photographing for 3D reconstruction</h1>

<p align="justify">
The following gives some guiding principles on photography for 3D reconstruction
purposes, that is, automatically reconstructing a textured 3D model from photographs.
The software upon which these principles have been tested are: Bundler based, 123D Catch,
and PhotoScan. There is no substitute for experimenting and gaining a feel for the best
approach, but hopefully the following will provide a short-cut.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
Use a fixed focal lens, otherwise known as a "prime lens" for an SLR camera. Most point-and-shoot cameras have a fixed focal lens. Note, this is generally not advice, but a requirement.
<p>
<li><p align="justify">
Never take two photographs from the same location.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
One will never reconstruct parts of the object that are not captured in a photograph.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
Generally move around the object in approximately 10 degree steps, example 1 below.
Repeat at one or more levels if the object is concave vertically, example 2 below.
<p>
<li><p align="justify">
2.5D objects, for example engravings and height fields, are significantly easier and usually
require fewer images, example 3 below.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The examples shown here are for self contained objects, generally try to keep
the object filling each frame.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The guidelines become more difficult and more software dependent for linearly scanned objects where
the object in question does not fill the photograph frame. At least 50% overlap is suggested, more if the texture is subtle. See example 4.
</p>
</ul>

<b>Example 1: Rocks outside Geology building, UWA</b><p>

Cameras (blue rectangles) circle the central rock in approximately 20 degree steps.
</center><p>

<b>Example 2: Lion statue, Hong Kong Dragon Gardens</b><p>
<center>
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/reconstructionphoto/example2.jpg"><img src="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/reconstructionphoto/example2.jpg" width=800 height=528 border=1></a><br>
More complicated object requires photographs (red)
at different heights to capture internal convolutions.
</center><p>

<b>Example 3: Temple fa√ßade, Gommateswara, India</b><p>
<center>
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/reconstructionphoto/example3.jpg"><img src="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/reconstructionphoto/example3.jpg" width=800 height=481 border=1></a><br>
2.5D panels require the fewest photographs. Shown here in a circular arc but a linear sweep would be just as good.
</center><p>

<b>Example 4: Dragon staircase, Hong Kong</b><p>
<center>
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/reconstructionphoto/example4.jpg"><img src="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/reconstructionphoto/example4.jpg" width=800 height=727 border=1></a><br>
2.5D example but illustrating overlapping linear photographic track.
Each shot only has a portion of the object in view.
