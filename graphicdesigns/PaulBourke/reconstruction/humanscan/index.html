The following presents the results of an experiment to reconstruct a largely
naked human. Unlike most scanning processes for humans, there was no need for
a textured model. The application was only interested in the geometry of the
body in question. The challenge is that for the smooth healthy skin of the
young subjects there would be very few feature points, as such the reconstructed
models would generally be low quality. In order to test the pipeline under
multiple camera scenarios a mannequin was chosen, this had the additional
characteristic of being even smoother and glossier than human skin.

There are a number of solutions to the lack of feature points, one is to use a data projector to
project a pattern onto the model. This is most applicable for subjects that cannot
otherwise be interfered with. In this case it was decided to paint the subject
with standard body paint. This washes off easily and given the painting pattern
used creates a very high resolution random pattern that seemed to be ideally
suited to the feature point process.
Basically the paint was "dabbed" on by hitting the skin with the end of the bristles, which
then randomly flay sideways giving the pattern shown.

Prior to applying the paint as described various tests per performed on a piece of PVC
piping. This included streaks of paint, it performed much worse than the stipple pattern.
Multiple colours were also tested but they seemed to offer no improvement.

Final reconstructed model is shown below. While the geometric detail is hard to judge
from these, it should be noted that the gaps in the waist and arm seams have been
resolved and they are on the scale of 1mm. 
As expected the most challenging areas were under the arms and between the legs. There are
three factors contributing to this: those regions have the fewest overlapping images,
they are generally darker, and the photographs are generally taken at shearing angles.
