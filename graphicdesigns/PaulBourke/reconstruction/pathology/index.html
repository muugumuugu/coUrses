<h3>Report on the 3D reconstruction of preserved organs within glass containers</h3>
<a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
November 2013
</center>

<p align="justify">
The automatic reconstruction of 3D digital models of real world objects 
based solely upon photographs is coming of age. The author has been exploring the various
algorithms and implementations (both freeware and commercial) for a number of years with
encouraging results. One application area has been the capture of heritage objects, typically
made of highly textured solids (wood and stone) which is known to be favoured by the 
algorithms. Still other types of object surface are known to generally fail, such as
highly reflective surface. The challenge here is to reconstruction objects (organs) 
contained within rectangular glass vessels and submerged in preserving fluids.
Two initial test samples follow.

The above two images are one of a sequence captured for each specimen. Due to refraction
effects as one passes the corners, no attempt was made to photograph and reconstruct the
360 model, something readily possible for unobstructed objects in air. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The equipment consists of a Canon 5D MkIII and an L-series Canon 100mm prime lens
(fixed focal length). The reconstruction software chosen was PhotoScan due mainly to
it's stability and high quality results we have obtained when
reconstructing objects from other disciplines.

<b>Movies and 3D models</b><p>
<p align="justify">
Small movies are provided of the reconstructed model being rotated +-60 degrees:
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/pathology/a_small.mov">sample a</a> and <a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/pathology/b_small.mov">sample b</a>. While these
only rotate horizontally, one could also rotate vertically. This could be explored 
interactively using software such as MeshLab, OBJ modes are provided:
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/pathology/a_obj.zip">sample a OBJ archive</a> and
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/reconstruction/pathology/b_obj.zip">sample b OBJ archive</a>.
