Photogrammetry is the name given to a range of techniques by which 3D properties of an 
object are derived from 2D images. It is most often associated with the derivation of 
topology from aerial photographs, this is now more commonly referred to as a 2.5D 
reconstruction since the surfaces are generally convex. The automated creation of full 
3D models from a series of photographs has been an active area of research for many 
years in computer science and vision research, often referred to as SfM (Structure from 
Motion) [1]. The techniques would appear to be maturing, this is reflected in a number of 
stable software tools being released from research laboratories both as commercial 
products but also in the public domain.

<p align="justify">
This poster presents some recent exploration in this area. A number of applications at 
UWA for automatic 3D reconstruction from photographs have been identified, these include the 
population of game engines with accurate models (as opposed to manually created models 
involving artistic interpretation), creation of virtual worlds 
with realistic models [2] without the need for time consuming manual modelling, and 
generating databases of 3D models for research 
and documentation in archaeology [3] and virtual heritage.
