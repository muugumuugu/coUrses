<div align="justify"><font size=+0>

I gave this presentation as a special program at Grand Canyon National Park in the Shrine 

of the Ages on Friday 31 December 2004 and Saturday 1 January 2005.  The slide show 

and notes are now accessible from the web for viewing by individuals and/or use by teachers in classrooms.  What I 

ask in return is that no changes be made to the materials.  Suggestions will be 

appreciated and changes made if deemed appropriate.  

</a>

<br><br>

Using the slides as slates for your own markings by highlighting similarity in the images 
may provide a richer viewing experience.  (Instructions for doing this in 
PowerPoint are available on every slide.)  Let this be an active experience.  Play with it.  
The marks are only there while the slide is up. 

<br><br>

Every slide 

is shown below in thumbnail form with its respective notes.  The thumbnails have very 

low resolution.  The images in the presentation, 

however, have fairly good resolution, hopefully they will be projector quality (set the projector 

for 800x600 image size).

          "Natural Fractals" is hyperlinked to the Earth Monitoring System website's  
          Nonlinear Geoscience    Fractals page. This site provides easy to read information 
          about fractal systems in nature, focusing on geology. I think it is an appropriate 
          introductory link for a 
   presentation about natural fractals in the Grand Canyon!  It is a friendly site to explore. The 
          link was originally to the main page of the Yale Fractal Geometry website, 
          the most comprehensive web source that I know of for technical information 
          about fractals. 
          Many links to Yale's pages are scattered throughout the presentation, plus, 
   the Snow section is taken verbatim from their site.

          Although all images in this presentation were taken at Grand Canyon, 
          the presentation focuses on similarity in nature generally, i.e., not 
          just at Grand Canyon. I often use the term similarity instead of self-similarity. 
          Natural fractals have self-similar properties. Keep in mind, however, 
          that the exact self-similarity in geometric fractals and the approximate 
          self-similarity in natural fractals are not identical. Even though not 
          identical, they share significant properties that include scale-invariance 
          and similar shapes that repeat on different scales. <br>
          <br>

          The first link on this slide is terrific for kids. It goes to Cynthia 
          Lanius     main fractals page. If you use the search term     fractals     in 
          Google, Cynthia's page is the first hit, it is the number one fractals 
          page, is very friendly and upbeat    is geared toward children    and the 
          information presented is credible. <br>
          <br>
          The second link is to Paul Bourke's     Self Similarity     page. Paul's site 
          is diverse in content, and is technologically advanced. It is a high-end 
          site geared toward adults. It has to be one of the most fun sites to 
          explore, if you like math and the sciences. On this page, he does a 
          great job of showing similarity on different scales, and scale-invariance 
          (aka scale independence). This is a fine page for beginners to the subject 
          from both a words and visual standpoint. <br>
          <br>
              What shape the parts are depends entirely on the object.     This cannot 
          be overstated. Let me breeze ahead to Slide 56 in the presentation, 
          the first slide where a Sierpinski tetrahedron is sitting in an image. 
          If you see a Sierpinski tetrahedron in one of my pictures, it doesn't 
          imply that nature is filled with triangles and/or tetrahedra or any 
          like thing. Repeated experiences around people while out taking photographs 
   with the structures over the past three 
          years have shown me that this is a common assumption to jump to, and, 
          once jumped to it is very hard for people    adults and children alike    to 
          undo. Nature has its own shapes that are typically completely different 
          from familiar shapes in Euclidean geometry, although we will see some 
          intersections of nature with Euclidean shapes in the Canyon section. 
          In the Canyon, we will be looking for shapes like lines and boxes, blocks, 
          and rectangles. The Canyon has a lot of rectilinear structure. </p>

          This slide provides links to information about scale-invariance, 
   the magnification symmetry of fractals, connections between 
   fractals and chaos, and some perspective 
          about what is fractal and what is not. 
   <br><br>

   Usually when we're walking around, 
          there are objects around to indicate how big something is. We can see 
          a lot of scaling in tree limbs, for instance, several stages of substructure 
          are present. Tree limbs are scale-invariant even when there is no question about 
          the size of the limbs. The point is that if there were no frame of reference, 
          a tiny section of tree could be magnified and passed off as a bigger section: 
          <i>symmetry of magnification</i>. 
   <br><br>
   The EMS page gives a good description of 
   chaotic processes.  One example of things fractal but not chaotic<b>:</b> geometric 
   fractals    because they are completely deterministic.  There is nothing uncertain 
   about the way they are going to grow or the shape they will become at infinity. 
   An example of something chaotic but not fractal<b>:</b> frenzied ocean waves, and highly 
   turbulent water generally.  Apparently, similar substructure isn't present once a 
        certain level of turbulence is reached    when the process gets too wild, randomness 
   may completely take over (I'm only trying to give a sense of the situation, am not speaking 
   with authority about this).  
   <br><br>
   I have 
          also included a link to Yale's page about "things that look like fractals 
          but aren't", to reinforce that everything isn't fractal, 
          and to give a sense about what is fractal and what is not. Now, 
          some of the examples on the page don't connect with me personally, I 
          would prefer some examples that are more concrete, but hopefully the 
          page will add some perspective to your experience. </p> <br>

              Clouds are not fractal     and makes the point that although fractal geometry 
          describes certain aspects of clouds (including complexity, and general 
          shape), there are many aspects of clouds and cloud behaviour that fractal 
          geometry doesn't explain at all. </p> <br>

          Trees are the topic. The link goes to a site with some fractal trees 
          and bushes. The branches in trees and bushes are almost always fractal, 
          whereas their outer foliage rarely is. There is good reason for this, 
          referenced in slides 78 and 86. </p> <br>

          "Boundaries" links to a set of fractal games from an NSF-funded program 
          that I attended for several summers out of Florida Atlantic University 
          (FAU) in Boca Raton. "Coastlines" is the fractal boundaries game. It 
          is very easy to play, and it is fun to change the parameters to arrive 
          at different coastline appearances. <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> these games 
          were created using Java language. Windows no longer comes with the ability 
          to run Java. If your computer is fairly new, you might have to download 
          the necessary software to run these games and other Java programs, available 
          at no charge, at: http://java.sun.com. I am told it is a fairly time-consuming 
          download. </p> <br>

          Rocks. I have linked to some general information about geology and fractals. 
          It is good from a perspective standpoint and fits in well with my presentation. 
          I disagree with one thing said on the page. It is stated that the detail 
          in (natural) fractals goes on ad infinitum. In nature, however, this 
          really isn't the case. Greater detail that goes on forever is the idea 
          behind fractals, yes, but in nature this idea can    t play out all the 
          way. For instance, you can    t keep breaking a rock into smaller rocks, 
          forever, eg., the fractal structure of a natural object doesn't go all 
          the way to its atomic structure. Whatever the specific similarity aspect 
          you are observing in a natural object, that object will have pre-fractal 
          states where the shape-similarity aspect is not present. </p> <br>

          Libbrecht also makes snowflakes using an electric needle of some sort. 
          It is a fabulous site to explore. His focus is not on fractals, you 
          won    t hear him even say the word fractal, even though he says much of 
          the same things. The section on snow in my presentation, however    it 
          is taken verbatim from the Yale Fractal Geometry website    is presented 
          from a fractals perspective and uses all the proper lingo. I have included

              Look for the same shape on different scales.     I    ve used arrows to point 
          out some shapes that remind me of scallops, also outlined one of them. 
          On slide 14, I outlined a smaller scallop from the edge of the bigger 
          scallop. If we could zoom in, we would probably also notice scallops 
          on the smaller scallop. Slide 15 shows the image with no words. This 
          provides an opportunity to examine the image without animations present. 
          The different masses of land shadow each other. They are all in the 
          same vicinity, probably have about the same rock content, have been 
          exposed to approximately the same weather conditions over a long period

          I've included this image because the two dogleg sections in the foreground 
          of the Canyon stand out like beacons. They look a lot alike, and there 
          are probably dogleg extensions at their edges. </p> <br>

          This is the first slide showing the main pattern theme that I have chosen 
          to address in this section. It is a pattern of mutually orthogonal joints 
          that run throughout the Canyon, pointed out to me by a geology professor 
          at ASU. The joints are present on a massive number of scales. The rock 
          is permeated with them, but we only see them after they have been exposed 
          to weathering. They were caused by rock uplift and expansion. It has 
          to do with the way rock releases pressure. The joints begin forming 
          way underground while the rock is uplifting, and expansion continues 
          above ground until all pressure is released. The first release is in 
          the direction of uplift, the second release is mutually orthogonal to 
          the first, and the third and final direction is mutually orthogonal 
          to both the first and second releases of pressure. But pressure is releasing 
          in concert, in an interconnected way, <i>as opposed to</i>: 1) all one 
          direction, 2) all the next direction, and 3) all the final direction. 
          The professor who revealed this to me is introduced in the next slide. 
          For the moment, in this slide, start looking for the pattern highlighted 
          in this image. </p> <br>

          Slide 20 shows Paul Knauth, Professor of Geology at ASU, pictured with 
          his granddaughter. He has been observing this joint pattern for about 
          30 years. <br>

          <br>
          Once you learn to recognize the joints in their different forms, looking 
          at them both in images and in person at the Canyon is very easy. You 
          can see them from anywhere, but they stand out (as a thematic pattern) 
          more clearly from a distance. The joints in the top half of the Canyon 
          are at the same orientation. (All information I am providing is from 
          what Knauth relayed to me, a brief synopsis follows.) <br>
          <br>
          <u><i>In the bottom half of the Canyon</i></u>: several sets of joints 
          are present at different orientations. Whole sets of joints are superimposed 
          on other whole sets of joints. This has happened because the Canyon bobs up and down 
          like a cork. Lower sections have recompressed and have later been uplifted 
          again, reintroducing the entire expansion process, and sometimes the 
          uplift hasn't been straight up, the rock is uplifted from an angle. 
          From a joints standpoint, the geology from the half-point down is far 
          more complex than the geology from the half-point to the top, so I decided 
          to stick with the top half. Plus, I have never even been to the bottom 
          of the Canyon to see these more complex patterns. Apparently, if you 
          hike to the bottom, you are going to see a different, more complex picture 
          than is shown in any of my images. <br>

          You don't have to look only for blocks, you can look for lines. There 
          are horizontal lines in the form of ridges or cracks, vertical lines 
          in the form of ridges or cracks, and blunt faces. Blunt faces are outermost 
          sections of Canyon, behind or underneath which are many cracks. Imagine 
          looking at a loaf of bread head on. While you can only see the heel, 
          you know there are a lot of slices behind it. This is how it is with 
          blunt faces in the Canyon. </p> <br>

          A typical wide, vertical crack is seen here at the rim. Notice the soft 
          edges of the horizontal ridges that run throughout the image along the 
          rim. Slide 32 (Canyon 21) shows a place Knauth pointed out where this 
          section will almost surely break away. We have already noticed that 
          the walls of the Canyon tend toward bluntness. The piece of rock immediately 
          below this section has already released, and the topmost section will 
          someday follow. It will be a terrible thing if someone happens to be 
          standing on it when it falls. Slide 33 shows the image with no words 
          or animation. Notice the shadowing in the rear of the image, and the common 
   ridges shared throughout this area of the Canyon. We are looking at 
          sections of Canyon in the same vicinity that probably have a highly 
          similar rock concentration that have been exposed to similar weather 
          conditions over a long period of time. Is it any wonder that the Canyon 
          looks the same in localized regions? </p> <br>

          This image begins a Canyon Rim focus on the joints, to make a connection 
          between the rim and walls of the Canyon. I find it to be an amazing 
          image because the blocks in the foreground have such a     regular     appearance. 
          It was taken in the Mather Point area. It looks to me like someone actually 
          carved the blocks, but it is nature    s own carvings that we see here. 
          The rim will recede with time, as more and more joints are weathered 
          and fall, new joints are revealed and weathered, and more blocks fall 
          from the Rim into the Canyon. </p> <br>

          This image, like the previous image, is from Mather Point. I have outlined 
          some exposed, weathered cracks on the rim. They continue further along in hairline 
          cracks that are at the surface but are not yet weathered. I am highlighting 
          barely enough to bring a few patterns out visually. There is a great 
          deal more to glean from these images than the little bit I highlight. 
          For instance, look at the section leading out into the Canyon in the 
          center of the image: the lines, the blocks, the weathering. We can look 
          at the images and see where blocks are, but often times, we can also 
          see where blocks were and are no longer. Broken extensions of Canyon 
          used to be sections of solid rock with Canyon joints running through 
          them. </p> <br>

          This is another instance of what is shown in the previous few images. 
          At this point, try to bring to mind the previous slides. Look at the 
          horizontal and vertical cracks and ridges. Look at the bluntness of 
          the Canyon walls overall, and the myriad individual blunt pieces that 
          make them up. Focusing now on the closest Canyon wall in this image, 
          it is a big, blunt face that is made of blunt faces that is made of 
          blunt faces. There is, furthermore, much more detail than we can see, 
          even if we were scaling the wall with our nose to it. At any given point 
          in time, we can only see what has been weathered. The rest is hidden 
          to our eyes. </p> <br>

          This image is from Desert View Drive. It shows a weathered section of 
          rim with lots of joints. The cracks highlighted in yellow, while orthogonal 
          to each other, are off-orientation to the other localized cracks. Everywhere 
          you look, there are exceptions of one kind or another to prominent patterns. 
          But now look at the lines in the background sections of Canyon. There

          Even after Knauth told me about the joints, I got lost in big views 
          of the Canyon, there is so much information to take in, so many ways 
          to look at the Canyon and experience it. Originally, this image was 
          meant to point out the falling block highlighted in Slide 45 (Canyon 
          34). I had accidentally placed a line around the text box, but left 
          it there, because the line bordering the box appealed to me. It looked 
          so "right." It took a long time to realize that the rectangular outline 
          on the box looked good because the image is itself filled with rectangular 
          shapes. I later added a slide [Slide 44 (Canyon 33)] to highlight some 
          of the rectangular shapes in the image. <br>
          <br>
          Forget about the joints for a moment, just enjoy the rectangles, or 
          whatever it is you see. Perhaps instead of rectangles, you noticed the 
          pyramid-like shapes below the rectangles, pyramidal shapes, by the way, 
          that are made of smaller pyramidal shapes made of yet smaller pyramidal

          I have turned the focus to falling blocks. The block in this image has 
          started its way down the Canyon. Winter 2005 has brought a lot of rain 
          and snow to the high country in Arizona that will help blocks like this

          The joint pattern isn't as obvious in this image, camouflaged by lots 
          of things going on in the rock. One particular spot in the image is 
          reminiscent of the previous image, but without a tell-tale block, a clear 
          space left by a fallen block that is no longer around. </p> <br>

          This shows a heavily weathered section with a lot of fallen blocks. 
          Look at the section in the far background, too, where only a piece of 
          the (now) topmost section remains. Some areas of Canyon stay together 
          better than others. I wonder, is it because localized areas have seen 
          harsher weather over time, or the rock in this area is more susceptible 
          to weathering? Whatever the reasons are, this section of Canyon looks 
          like it is falling away faster than some neighbouring sections. As blocks 
          fall, joints at their surface weather. Big blocks weather into smaller 
          blocks, and by the time they arrive in the lower part of the Canyon, 
          many are tiny rectilinear rocks. I asked Knauth: if these blocks are 
          all falling down into the Canyon, won't the Canyon eventually fill up 
          with blocks? He said many arrive at the bottom in little pieces and 
          are carried away by the river, that the river acts as a big conveyor 
          belt that transports the remains of fallen blocks out of the Canyon. </p>

          I have called this image <i>field of fallen blocks</i> because of all 
          the blocks that have built up on that single ridge, as if the plateau 
          is holding on to them and won    t let them follow their 'bigger' path. 
          Also notice how flat yet knarled the closest section of Canyon wall 
          is. In an up-close view, the joint pattern would hardly be visible, if at all, 
          present as it is in concert with so many other processes. </p> <br>

          boundary inside the little oval and then look at the boundary inside

          The images used thus far in this presentation have had a frame of reference 
          present, like the skyline, or trees, something that has revealed the 
          relative size of the landmasses in the images. This image has no external 
          frame of reference. It is difficult to determine the size of what we 
          are seeing. We could isolate a smaller section of the image and pass 
          it off as a more massive section of Canyon or a smaller piece than it actually is. This 
          is an example of scale-independence, or scale-invariance. <br>
          <br>
          Scale-invariance is crucial to being fractal, no matter the type of 
          fractal structure. I    m isolating on natural and geometric fractals in 
          this presentation, but there are a lot of types. Scale-invariance is 
          an inherent property of all types of fractals. </p> <br>

          Taken the same day as the previous image, at the East Rim, this image 
          is here because I like it, and it seemed like a nice ending place for 
          the Canyon section. The next sections are shorter. The joints demanded 
          a lot of attention, first of all, to look at them in different ways 
          (looking for blocks versus looking for lines, far away views versus 
          underfoot views on the Canyon rim), and secondly, to consider effects 
          from joints (like falling blocks). This was put together for presentation 
          at Grand Canyon National Park. The Interpretive Education Division of 
          the GCNPS expected that every image and all content should focus on 
          Grand Canyon, so it made sense to have the biggest section be on the 
          Canyon itself. Paul Knauth made the Canyon section worth looking at 
          by telling me about the joint pattern, and taking time out of his busy 
          schedule to answer many questions. </p> <br>

          Clouds. How big is a given cloud? You can    t know unless there is some 
          external frame of reference in the scene. If you break a cloud into 
          smaller and smaller pieces, at some point you will have something that 
          isn't a cloud. I'm not sure at what point that occurs, but self-similar 
          detail doesn't go on forever in nature. It has a lower limit. What is 
          the upper limit of a cloud, i.e., is there a limit to how big a cloud 
          can get? Limits are assumed to exist with nature, however, a reasonable 
          question to ask might be: how big could the biggest cloud possibly be? 
          Is there such a thing as the biggest possible cloud? There are some 
          huge versions in space made of dust and interstellar gas. A vapour cloud 
          on earth would probably be limited in size by the boundary of our atmosphere. 
          But I don't know, am making no claims about it, am rather throwing this 
          out as a question. <br>

          Slide 57 (Clouds 2) briefly addresses the appearance of the Sierpinski

          tetrahedron page; the second is to an explanation about geometric fractals 
          on the Arcytech website; the third is to a section on L-systems on the 
          Archytech website, it is a really great site to learn about fractals 
          (the applets are written in Java, and Windows no longer comes with the 
          ability to run it; either the images will come up, or if they don't, 
          a link is on the image to download necessary software). An important 
          thing is to realize that we are not looking for triangles and tetrahedrons 
          in nature. Nature has its own, very different shapes that repeat on 
          different scales and are scale independent. The tetrahedron is in the 
          image 1) because it looks beautiful there, and 2) to highlight and draw 
          attention to the mathematical structure of nature. </p> <br>

          This image is a great complement to some artificial landscape slides

          I have a copy of the slides to use for in-person presentations, but 
          cannot use them in the web version. His artificial slides look like 
          a re-creation of a section of this real-world image. Voss created an 
          artificial mountain/canyon landscape, and by changing the lighting, 
          made it into clouds, from the same file, the same Iterated Function 
          System. I haven    t said much about clouds, but the point is to look at 
          them and realize that if a piece of a cloud breaks away, it becomes 
          a whole cloud in its own right. The parts are similar to the whole. </p>

          This is the second largest section of the presentation. It might better 
          be called     Branching    , except that it focuses on the branching in trees. 
          It is a large section because I wanted to consider trees with bare branches, 
          and also trees with leaves on them. It can be difficult to see the fractal 
          structure of tree branches when they are covered by leaves. To add to 
          the confusion, leaves are typically not fractal. You have to separate 
          them in your mind from the fractal structure of the tree <i>while looking 
          at the tree</i>, and this can be hard when almost all you see is leaves. 
          They do have fractal properties, however. The veins that run through 
          them are fractal, and there are times when their edges have a fractal 
          boundary, but leaves are generally not made up of little leaves that look 
          just like them. </p> <br>

          This is the easy way to look at trees, is when they have bare branches. 
          I believe one of the Interpretative Rangers said this tree is a Juniper, 
          seen frequently in the Canyon. <br>
          <br>
          From tree to tree, there are different 
          characteristics between the limbs, such as the shapes 
          of the intersections, from wide U shapes to sharp V's and everything 
          in-between. Pretty much, whatever the shape at an intersection in a 
          given tree, that shape will hold in the intersections throughout the 
          entire tree. The tree in this image also has curly branches. Notice 
          that there isn't just an isolated branch or two with a curly limb, this 
          is a characteristic pattern of the limbs throughout the tree. </p> <br>

          In both the tree and the (Sierpinski) tetrahedron there is fractal structure: 
          scale invariance, small parts that look like big parts, and exponential 
          growth    an overall fractal pattern. In spite of commonalities, there 
          are differences between the way these two objects grow that are representative 
          of differences between geometric fractals and natural fractals generally. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Some differences include that the Sierpinski tetrahedron uses an exact 
          shape (a regular tetrahedron), the growth pattern between stages is 
          exact, and the growth can feasibly go on forever. Contrast this with 
          the tree, where both the similarity between the shape of the limbs and 
          the growth pattern between stages is approximate rather than exact, 
          plus, the tree has a limited number of stages of growth. It "tips out". 
          The tree shows approximate, or statistical self-similarity. Geometric 
          fractals, on the other hand, show exact self-similarity. One qualification: 
          self-similarity only really happens in the limit, i.e., at infinity. 
          Somewhere, at infinity, the Sierpinski tetrahedron will achieve self-similarity, 
          where every little part will be identical to the whole structure. It 
          is a kind of "out-there" thought! </p> <br>

            This step begins the process of following a connected path through 
            4 stages of growth of a Sierpinski tetrahedron. There is a single 
            opening highlighted in this slide, the one and only biggest opening. 
            At any given stage of growth, there is a single biggest opening. Notice 
            there are a few choices for the second biggest opening, 4 to be exact. 
            Whatever path is chosen, much detail and growth of the structure will 
            be left behind along the way, and the numbers will exponentially explode 
            as growth progresses. <br>

            to what is happening. It might also be the case that Yale's building 
            method (using envelopes to make the tetrahedrons) would work great 
            for grades as low as 2nd or 3rd, I just don't know. </p>

            Following what appears to be a small path    only 4 stages of growth 
            so far    we have already left behind 3+15+63=81 openings total. Beyond 
            this image, the next stage    the stage-5    has 128 openings to choose 
            from, with (as always with Sierpinski's tetrahedron) 4 openings touching 
            a connected path. <br>

            <br>
            Sierpinski's tetrahedron grows in an identical form from stage to 
            stage. The shape is a regular tetrahedron, and it always grows in 
            powers of 4. Each stage is 4 of the previous stage set tip-to-tip. 
            The edge-length either doubles at each stage, or the lengths of the 
            individual tetrahedra are halved at each stage, depending on the growth 
            method chosen.

            Now we've switched from the tetrahedron to the tree. We're following 
            a connected path through the tree. <br>

            <br>
            Five massive branches lead off the trunk at the first intersection 
            (one branch is hidden from view by the front most branch). Each intersection 
            along the path is marked by a yellow oval, called a node. The possible 
            paths leading off the node are highlighted, where only one limb is 
            followed to the next node. With the first path choice, 4/5    s of the 
            tree is left behind. The next intersection has 4 branches leading 
            off it, one path is taken, leaving (4/5)x(3/4) of tree behind. At 
            the 3rd intersection, there are only three limbs. One limb is chosen, 
            the other two abandoned, leaving (4/5)x(3/4)x(2/3)    s behind. Next 
            intersection, there are only 2 limbs, leaving a total so far of (4/5)x(3/4)x(2/3)x(1/2)=~80% 
            of the detail of the tree behind. When stages 5 ane 6 are included, 
            plus two additional stages that were too small to highlight on the 
            slide, each with two branches to choose from in this way-oversimplified 
            example, approximately 99% of the tree is left behind. <br>

            <br>
            Notice that the tree isn't growing in exactly the same way from stage 
            to stage. Although the number of limbs is growing exponentially, the 
            rate of growth between stages is decreasing, growth is surging forward 
            <i>with limits</i>, probably because nature is efficient. The limbs 
            have to fit into a real-world space that includes constraints of size 
            and proportion. Leaves have to fit on its many branches. If 4 or 5 
            limbs had branched off at every single intersection along the way, 
            there wouldn't be room for all the limbs much less any leaves! Assuming 
            that similar growth is taking place throughout the tree, at stage 
            8 this tree will have 5x4x3x2x2x2x2x2 limbs, or approximately 2,000 
            limbs (found by multiplying the number of limbs at each stage along 
            the path, and including the two stages at the top that were too small 
            to highlight). <br>

            <br>
            I can't tell, there may be an intersection of branches hidden behind 
            the tetrahedron, a 3-branch node. If this is correct and the number 
            of intersections is really 9, then the number of limbs increases to 
            somewhere around 5,000-6,000 in the real tree in this image. Suppose 
            the tree had grown at a consistent rate exponentially, like the tetrahedron. 
            At the first node there were 5 branches. If it had continued at a 
            rate of 5 branches per intersection, the number of limbs at stage 
            8 would be 5^8 = 5x5x5x5x5x5x5 = 390,625 limbs! And if there are really 
            9 stages to this tree, 5^9 = 5x5x5x5x5x5x5x5x5 would be 1,953,125 
            limbs! It simply couldn't be. So real trees in nature show exponential 
            growth, yes, but it shows up in a different way than in the Sierpinski 
            tetrahedron, and geometric fractals in general. This doesn't invalidate 
            the fractal structure that they share. A small piece of a tree closely 
            resembles a bigger piece of the same tree. Both Sierpinski    s tetrahedron 
            and the tree look very much like the parts that make them up, even 
            though they reveal different patterns of fractal growth. <br>
            <br>
            It should be noted that some biological systems, bacteria growth is 
            one example, model classic exponential growth, but when that happens, 
            to whatever degree it happens, it is because the natural system can 
            handle it. Otherwise, nature would make adjustments, similar to the 
            tree in this example. </p>

          "When leaves hide branches." When tree branches have leaf coverage, 
          it can be difficult to examine the shapes of the branches. You have 
          to look for little sections of tree that resemble each other, and sections 
          within sections that resemble each other. You also need to satisfy yourself 
          that this is true not because of the leaves but because of the branches 
          underneath them that the leaves are growing on. This was a sticking 
          point for me. For at least two years after learning about fractals, 
          I had terrible difficulties with leafed trees. It is due to this long 
          personal difficulty that I am including this section. If it was a stumbling 
          block for me, it might be a stumbling block for other people, too. </p>

   The words in parenthesis on this slide are from Root Gorelick, a faculty 
   research associate with the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University.  
   There was nothing about terminal organs in this presentation until he 
   pointed out the connection.  
   <br><br>
          These slides show a tree with brushy features where the branches underneath 
          are almost not visible. The slides for this image 1) reinforce the message 
          of the slides from the previous two images, and 2) focus on leaves not 
          typically being fractal. They are at the tips of the tree. Leaves are 
          terminal organs and as such do not reproduce little copies of themselves. 
          On the other hand, the vein structure in leaves reveal fractal branching 
          patterns, and some leaves have fractal boundaries, meaning the the edge 
          might reveal the same shape at smaller and smaller scales of detail. 
          There are so many distinctions to make, or so it seems to me. The point 
          here is that leaves are generally not made up of little leaves that 
          look just like them. The fern,
          however, is a big, leafy plant with leaves that are made of leaves that 
          are made of leaves that have the same shape. This holds with the 
          asparagus fern too, although the pattern is much harder to see. 
          You could think of an asparagus fern as a plant made of winding wide-bristled 
          brushes made of smaller winding, wide-bristled brushes made of smaller 
          winding wide-bristled brushes. The brushes and bristles circle like 
          a helix around whatever stem they are coming off of. The fern family, 
          though, is an exception. I've included links to images of them since 
          they are not part of the Canyon decor (that I have seen) and are therefore 
          not seen in the presentation, I bring them up only in these notes. Leaves 
          are generally not reproductive. It may be the case that ferns are not 
          technically "leaves." </p> <br>

          Nothing new is introduced in this slide. It serves to support the previous 
          slides. The image was taken in the school yard of the Grand Canyon on-site 
          school. To me, these branches resemble a boot, and I    ve followed the 
          boot shape through some smaller sections of branches. The huge branch 
          is made up of little branches that have a similar appearance, that when 
          put together, form a bigger shape that resembles the smaller shapes. 
          The branches are pretty much hidden by leaves that clothe them. People 
          wear clothes every day. We don't have to see people without their clothes 
          on in order to recognize them, and we don't have to see trees without 
          leaves on them to recognize the fractal branching of the limbs underneath! </p>

          This set of slides is important. It follows the theme of leaves being 
          terminal organs and not fractal. The really important part of this group 
          of slides is that the image shows a fractal structure in a male cone 
          containing bracts with only one level of substructure. The male cone 
          reproduces copies of itself on one scale in the form of bracts that 
          the terminal organs (the needles on the tree) grow out of. It is frequently 
          said that nature shows a limited number of similar scales. Here is the 
          bottom rung, the least you can have, one stage of similarity. The pattern 
          of mutually orthogonal joints running throughout Grand Canyon, on the 
          other hand, is present on a magnificent, uncountable number of scales 
          (it is finite, but it is a huge number). We have natural systems like 
          clouds and the Canyon with a magnificent number of scales, systems like 
          trees and bushes with a nice handful of scales, and here are these male 
          cones with only a single scale of similar substructure. (I should point 
          out that some people might take issue with whether or not one stage 
          of similarity in this male cone is enough to say it is fractal. There 
          will probably be dissenting views.) </p> <br>

          I    ve included lightning because it    s enigmatic to look at and exciting 
          to children. In my in-person (i.e., not a web version) presentation, 
          I have an image of lightning striking the North Rim of Grand Canyon 
          taken by professional photographer Mike McFadden. Slide 91 (Lightning 
          1) links to the image on McFadden    s web page. The structure of lightning 
          is self-similar. As you zoom into it, what you see is more lightning. 
          As an aside, lightning strikes produce beautiful branching patterns. 
          Peter Ledlie took the picture shown on these slides. Ledlie    s url at 
          the bottom of Slide 91 (Lightning 1) shows pictures of him using equipment 
          to produce lightning strikes in his laboratory. </p> <br>

          This is one of my favourite images, and it is only seen in this one slide. 
          I like the way the Rim boundary stretches into the distance. Fractal 
          boundaries is a terrific topic for Grand Canyon. It is the topic that 
          the Rangers seemed to identify with the most, especially relating to 
          hiking and maps in the bottom of the Canyon. I hope to include some 
          of their perspectives and experiences as they apply to fractal geometry. 
          I haven    t even been to the bottom of the Canyon, have only seen it from 
          the top, aside from a couple of very short walks in. This section shows 
          the greatest potential for expansion. </p> <br>

          An extended fractal boundary has been created along the Canyon rim by 
          a block that is getting ready to fall. The block has separated and tilted 
          forward, and I have followed the big crack it has made with an imaginary 
          measuring stick. In Slide 97 (Boundaries 3), the measuring stick is 
          halved, and more detail is captured. In Slide 98 (Boundaries 4), the 
          measuring stick is halved again, and now we are beginning to closely 
          follow the path of this separation. If the measuring stick were shortened 
          again, and again, we would continue to follow the path more closely. 
          As a rough path is increasingly "hugged", the distance around it gets 
          longer, as more detail is captured. The rim boundary of Grand Canyon 
          is constantly changing. <br>

          <br>
          On another note, look at the saw-tooth edge of the dark section of Canyon 
          in the background. The pattern is tiered: in smaller scale above, in 
          larger scale below. </p> <br>

          to it. Look at the numbers on Slide 101 (Boundaries 6) that compare 
          the measuring stick to coastline length. They tell a compelling story.

          Tree trunks are fractal boundaries, where the fractal dimension is dependent 
          upon the roughness of the trunk. A rougher trunk has a higher fractal 
          dimension. This looks like a trunk with considerable roughness. The 
          pattern of the trunk itself, the shape of the pieces that make it up, 
          also shows statistical self-similarity, in that small sections of bark 
          resemble larger sections of bark. The link on the slide goes to a website 
          at the University of Manitoba called <i>Fractals in the Biological Sciences</i>. 
          Tree trunks are mentioned in their section 1.3. The link, however, goes 
          to section 5 where habitats are discussed. There is a lot of space for 
          tiny bugs on this trunk that bigger bugs can    t even get to. Tree trunks 
          play an important role in supporting biological diversity. I recommend 
          reading two of their sections entirely: sections 1 and 5, just skim 
          through the many fractal applications in biology that are briefly described. </p>

          Geometry web pages, my advice is to go to Google (www.google.com), and 
          in the search box, type the desired term and then add: + Yale + fractals. 
          This way, Google will bring up results on their website first. It    s 
          what I do most of the time. </p> <br>

          Hopefully at this point, an overall sense has been developed about fractals 
          in nature. If you have looked at the entire presentation and have visited 
          the links provided, perhaps a precursory, comparative understanding 
          has formed with regard to geometric fractals as well. It    s a huge topic. 
          My wish for viewers is that the journey be enjoyable while perspective 
          is acquired. </p> <br>

          In order of sequence of events: <br>
          <br>
          Summer 2003    <b>Heinz-Otto Peiten</b> and <b>Richard F. Voss</b>, mathematics 
          professors at Florida Atlantic University (Peitgen is also with the 
          University of Bremen) held a two-week NSF <i>Technology in the Classroom</i> 
          summer institute on working with PowerPoint, which I attended. <br>

          <br>
          Spring 2003 through November 2004    knowing ahead of time that I would 
          learn to use PowerPoint at the above-referenced NSF institute over the 
          summer, I began thinking about introducing a presentation about natural 
          fractals into a national park, to make a case for bringing math education 
          about fractals into what I think is a very appropriate environment for 
          it, from multiple angles. Not until Winter 2004 did I approach the Grand 
          Canyon National Park Service about it. Their response was non-committal 
          yet open-ended. Preparatory conversations with the Division of Interpretative 
          and Resource Education ensued, and it was decided that I would give 
          a trial run presentation at their on-site school. <br>
          <br>
          Spring 2004    <b>Marilyn Carlson</b>, mathematics professor and Director 
          of CRESMET at ASU, provided the loan of a laptop. <br>
          <br>
          Spring 2004    <b>Richard Voss</b> loaned me the use of his <i>making clouds 
          of of mountains</i> images for in-person presentations. His images aren't 
          in the web version, but they were an important contribution to the project 
          overall and helped it go forward, making connections between artificial 
          and real-world fractals in such a beautiful way. Whatever is on the 
          internet is unfortunately out there for the taking and there would be 
          no way to keep his images safe. <br>

          <br>
          May 2004    I gave the trial run fractals in nature presentation at the 
          Grand Canyon on-site school. It was very different from this one. At 
          that time I didn't even know about the joints. The decision was made 
          to go forward on something totally canyon-focused. <br>
          <br>
          Summer 2004    <b>Paul Knauth</b>, geology professor at ASU, told me about 
          the Canyon joints in a series of meetings, after which I began putting 
          the presentation together. He took time out of his schedule more than 
          once when he was wildly busy with grant writing and other pressing projects. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Fall 2004    <b>Don Jones</b>, mathematics professor and Chair of Undergraduate 
          Studies with the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at ASU, went 
          through the initial draft and offered several content-related suggestions, 
          all of which were incorporated. <br>

          <br>
          October 2004    <b>Charles Wahler</b>, Acting Assistant Chief of Interpretative 
          and Resource Education with the GCNPS, offered suggestions, all incorporated. 
          <br>
          <br>
          November 2004    I gave a trial run presentation at the <b>Mathematics 
          and Cognition Seminar</b>, where it was critiqued by professors from 
          mathematics, psychology, biology, human and family studies, and philosophy. 
          Many good suggestions were offered, and considerable changes ensued. 
          One example in particular: the insight offered about terminal organs 
          on slides 80 and 86-90 came from <b>Root Gorelick</b>, a faculty research 
          associate with the School of Life Sciences. <br>
          <br>

          December 2004    The presentation was given as a special program at Grand 
          Canyon National Park on New Years Eve 2004 and New Year's Day 2005. 
          Several <b>interpretive rangers</b> had interesting comments related 
          to their experiences with the Canyon which I plan to follow up on and 
          incorporate at a later time. <br>
          <br>
          February-March 2005    Considerations for placing this on the web were 
          size of download, providing slide notes, and generally trying to put 
          it up in such a way that people unfamiliar with the subject matter could 
          navigate it alone and choose to project it in a classroom if so desired. 
          <br>
          <br>
          March 2005    <b>Reimund Albers</b> from the University of Bremen offered 
          suggestions for the web version related to animations on some slides 
          and incorporating higher quality images. It was around 7MB's at that 
          time, and Reimund found that it didn't project well, so I replaced 480x640 
          medium quality images with 600x800 high quality images, increasing the 
          file size to 15MB's. Striking a balance between file download size and 
          viewing quality has been a struggle. Photography student and co-worker 
          <b>Brian Radspinner</b> has helped all along, but even more than usual 
          with the web version, answering questions about images and html code. 
          <br>

          <br>
          March 2005    <b>Paul Bourke</b>, Visualization Research Fellow with the 
          Swinburne Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, looked it over 
          and most of his suggestions focused on my animations and the appearance 
          of the text. All of his suggestions were incorporated, after which both 
          of us made the presentation available from our websites: in PowerPoint, 
          and a Keynote version for people with Macs. It is being readied for 
          pdf right now. If the presentation were accessible only from my website, 
          it would stay relatively obscure for a long time. By putting it on Paul's 
          site, too, it it went straight to the top of some big search terms in 
          Google. Plus, it is accessible from Paul's fractals page which comes 
          up at or near the top of a great many searches. The difference is like 
          being in a row boat in a lake with no breeze versus white-water rafting 
          on the Zambesi. <br>
          <br>
          by mid-April 2005    it should be up in pdf form. <b>Renate Mittelmann</b>, 
          Computer Research Specialist with Mathematics and Statistics at ASU 
          said anyone should be able to view a pdf version. Different versions 
          have different benefits. There are some sacrifices with pdf, but people 
          running Linux will at least be able to view it in this form, and others 
          may even prefer it. Renate and <b>Jialong He</b>, Information Technology 
          Specialist, always find time to answer questions even while everyone 
          is bombarding them with requests. <br>
          <br>

          If <b>you the viewer</b> find that something doesn't make sense, please 
          feel free to offer suggestions. If changes need to be made, I need to 
          know about it and make them. If your suggestion generates a content-based 
          or appearance-based change, your name will be added to this list along 
          with everyone else's. Feel free to email me with comments: gayla.chandler(at)asu.edu. 
          The subject line should read "Grand Canyon presentation". </p> <br>
