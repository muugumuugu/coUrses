<h1>Decision procedure for "oneness"</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>

Listen (<a href="oneness.mov">mov</a> or <a href="oneness.mid">midi</a>) 
to the oneness for the first 300 integers

A surprising source of chaos in number theory arises from
the so called "oneness" of any positive number. Consider iteratively
performing the following procedure starting with any positive number, if the 
number is even then divide it by 2, if odd then multiply it by 3 and
add 1. The number of steps before this series reaches 1 will be called
the oneness of the original number. For example the oneness of 3 is 7,
the sequence is 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

A graph showing the oneness of the first 1000 integers is given below<p>

<p align="justify">
Note that two neighbouring numbers can have vastly different oneness
values. for example, the oneness of 47 is 104 but the oneness of 48
in only 11. The oneness of 737 is 139 while the oneness of 738 is 20.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It turns out that there is no decision procedure to determine what the
oneness is! The only way to find out is to run the sequence which may be
infinite. (?)
