<h1>Interlinked square tori</h1>
Written and visualisations by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a>. Inspiration, algorithm and geometry generated by John Shier<br>
January 2014<p>

<p align="justify">
The following is a continuation of the work by John Shier on so called
"statistical geometry fractals" introduced 
<a href="../randomtile/index.html">here</a> in one, two, and three
dimensions and published in (<a href="index.html#refs">1</a>). 
The work presented here was inspired by a previously studied example in three dimensions
using randomly orientated tori, of interest was the interlocking of the tori which was a 
natural consequence of the space filling process.

<p align="justify">
In what follows, the tori are square and always axis aligned, this makes the intersection
test between two square tori faster and it is imagined increases the chances of linkages.
They are defined by a centroid, the plane they reside on (xy, yz, zx), their size, and the
relative thickness of the tori cross-section. The cross-sectional relative thickness is constant 
during the space filling process. One effect of reducing the relative thickness of the tori
cross section is that it increases the chance of linkages.
Note there are equal numbers of tori on each plane, they are added to the space filling
process in equal order.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As a means of verifying the process the results were visualised in PovRay, this allowed
visual confirmation that the space filling process was occurring as expected. When studying
the linkages the same visualisation techniques could be used to verify tori that were
supposed to be in a linked set were indeed all linked.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the following rendering the tori have a different material depending on the
plane they are aligned to. The space filling process can be implemented with contained
boundary conditions or periodic boundary conditions, the later is used here.

</center>

<p align="justify">
The structure can be easier to interpret if the tori are drawn with circular cross-sections,
this provides more shading information and due to the extra gaps allows one to see further
into the interior. Note that this is purely a visual technique, the space filling was still
performed as if the tori had the square profile.

<p align="justify">
The periodic boundary conditions means that the filled cube can tile space, a 3x3x1
tiling is illustrated below.

In addition to the space filling process this work looked at the linkages between
tori and additionally identifying large collections of linked tori. In the set
shown above the following is the largest single set of linked tori, 835 in total.
In case it isn't clear, this is a single connected object ... if it were a 
physical object then no individual tori could be separated from the group without
a breakage.

Another interesting way of visualising the results is to print a physical version
of an interlinked set. This not only allows one to explore the object/data in the  same
way as we normally explore objects in real life (using our hands and eyes) but also
confirms the set is a connected set by noticing that no tori "drop out".

The physical object is strangely engaging due, it is proposed, to the mixture between
order (the central tori that are constrained due to their density) and the messy disorder
of the loose exterior strands the hang away from the main structure.

As a small technical note on the 3D printing process, the current state of the 
technology has various constraints relating to colour fidelity, resolution, and the
smallest structures that can be realised. The 3D prints shown here were performed
on the ObJet printers since they, at the time of writing, were able to resolve the
fine structures required for the smallest tori in the dataset. Unfortunately that
printer does not support other than a single colour.
