unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is

it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without

<h3>What is a fractal?</h3>

<p align="justify">
B. Mandelbrot<br>
A rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of
which is (at least approximately) a reduced/size copy of the whole.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Mathematical<br>
A set of points whose fractal dimension exceeds its topological dimension.
</p>

<h3>Chaotic Systems</h3>

<p align="justify">
The classic Mandelbrot below has been the image that has greatly popularised
chaotic and fractal systems. The Mandelbrot set is created 
by a general technique where a function of the form 
z<sub>n+1</sub> = f(z<sub>n</sub>) 
is used to create a series of a complex variable. In the case
of the Mandelbrot the function is 
f(z<sub>n</sub>) = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + z<sub>o</sub>. This series in
generated for every initial point 
z<sub>o</sub> on some partition of the complex plane. To
draw an image on a computer screen the point under consideration is coloured
depending on the behaviour of the series which will act in one of the following
ways:
</p>
(a) decay to 0<br>
(b) tend to infinity<br>
(c) oscillate among a number of states<br>
(d) exhibits no discernible pattern<p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro1.gif" width=432 height=432></center><p>

<p align="justify">
In the figure above, situation (a) occurs in the interior portion, (b) in the
exterior, (c) and (d) near the boundary. The boundary of the set exhibits
infinite detail and variation (the boundary will never appear smooth
irrespective of the zoom factor), as well as self similarity.

An example using the same technique but a different function is called
"biomorphs" by C.A.Pickover. It uses the function 
f(z<sub>n</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;sin(z<sub>n</sub>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;e<sup>z</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;c
and gives rise to many biological looking creatures depending on the value of
the constant "c".

<h3>Strange Attractors</h3>

<p align="justify">
A second technique, often called "hopalong" after an article in Scientific
American in 1986 by Barry Martin, is normally used to represent the
strange attractor of a chaotic system, for example, the well known Julia set.
In this case each coordinate generated by the series is drawn as a small point,
ie: we hop-along from one point to the next. For an image on a plane the series
is either an equation of a complex variable or else there are two interrelated
equations, one for the x and one for the y coordinate. As an example consider
the following function:
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro3.gif" width=215 height=37></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
This series of x,y coordinates is specified by an initial point 
x<sub>o</sub>,y<sub>o</sub> and three
constants a,b, and c. The following is an example where a=0.4, b=1, and c=0.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro4.gif" width=441 height=441></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
Interestingly for strange attractors the initial point does not matter (except
for a few special cases), ie: all initial coordinates 
x<sub>o</sub>,y<sub>o</sub> result in the same
image. In other words, the image shows the x,y pairs that can be generated by
the series, any initial point will generate the same set of points although
they will be generated in a different order.
Another example attributed to Peter de Jong uses the two equations
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro5.gif" width=179 height=38></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
This gives swirling tendrils that appear three dimensional, an example is shown
below where a = -2.24, b = -0.65, c = 0.43, d = -2.43.

<h3>Newton Raphson</h3>
</a>

<p align="justify"> 
This technique is based on the Newton Raphson method of finding the solution
(roots) to a polynomial equation of the form
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro7.gif" width=253 height=20></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
The method generates a series where the n+1'th approximation to the solution is
given by
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro8.gif" width=118 height=35></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
where f'(z<sub>n</sub>) 
is the slope (first derivative) of f(z) evaluated at 
z<sub>n</sub>. To create
a 2D image using this technique each point in a partition of the plane is used
as initial guess, 
z<sub>o</sub>, to the solution. The point is coloured depending on which
solution is found and/or how long it took to arrive at the solution. A simple
example is an application of the above to find the three roots of the
polynomial z*z*z - 1 = 0. The following shows the appearance of a small portion
of the positive real and imaginary quadrant of the complex plane. A trademark
of chaotic systems is that very similar initial conditions can give rise to
very different behaviour. In the image shown there are points very close
together one of which converges to the solution very fast and the other
converges very slowly.

<h3>DLA - Diffusion Limited Aggregation</h3>

<table cellspacng=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign="top">
<p align="justify"> 
"The most useful fractals involve chance ... both their regularities and 
their irregularities are statistical." - Benoit B. Mandelbrot.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Many attractive images can be generated using theory from areas of Chemistry
and Physics. One such example is diffusion limited aggregation or DLA which
describes, among other things, the diffusion and aggregation of zinc ions in an
electrolytic solution onto electrodes. Another more colourful description
involves a city square surrounded by taverns. Drunks leave the taverns and
stagger randomly around the square until they finally trip over one of their
insensate companions at which time lulled by the sounds of peaceful snoring
they lie down and fall asleep. The tendril like structure is an aerial view of
the sleeping crowd in the morning.

<h3>Fractal Geometry</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
Almost all geometric forms used for building man made objects belong to
Euclidean geometry, they are comprised of lines, planes, rectangular volumes,
arcs, cylinders, spheres, etc. These elements can be classified as belonging to
an integer dimension, either 1, 2, or 3. This concept of dimension can be
described both intuitively and mathematically.
Intuitively we say that a line is one dimensional because it only takes 1
number to uniquely define any point on it. That one number could be the
distance from the start of the line. This applies equally well to the
circumference of a circle, a curve, or the boundary of any object.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro11.gif" width=453 height=59></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
A plane is two dimensional since in order to uniquely define any point on its
surface we require two numbers. There are many ways to arrange the definition
of these two numbers but we normally create an orthogonal coordinate system.
Other examples of two dimensional objects are the surface of a sphere or an
arbitrary twisted plane.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro12.gif" width=453 height=151></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
The volume of some solid object is 3 dimensional on the same basis as above, it
takes three numbers to uniquely define any point within the object.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro13.gif" width=442 height=179></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
A more mathematical description of dimension is based on how the "size" of an
object behaves as the linear dimension increases.
In one dimension consider a line segment. If the linear dimension of the line
segment is doubled then obviously the length (characteristic size) of the line
has doubled.
In two dimensions, ff the linear dimensions of a rectangle for example is
doubled then the characteristic size, the area, increases by a factor of 4.
In three dimensions if the linear dimension of a box are doubled then the
volume increases by a factor of 8.
This relationship between dimension D, linear scaling L and the resulting
increase in size S can be generalised and written as
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro14.gif" width=49 height=20></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
This is just telling us mathematically what we know from everyday experience.
If we scale a two dimensional object for example then the area increases by the
square of the scaling. If we scale a three dimensional object the volume
increases by the cube of the scale factor. 
Rearranging the above gives an expression for dimension depending on how the
size changes as a function of linear scaling, namely
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro15.gif" width=75 height=34></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
In the examples above the value of D is an integer, either 1, 2, or 3,
depending on the dimension of the geometry. This relationship holds for all
Euclidean shapes.
There are however many shapes which do not conform to the integer based idea of
dimension given above in both the intuitive and mathematical descriptions. That
is, there are objects which appear to be curves for example but which a point
on the curve cannot be uniquely described with just one number. If the earlier
scaling formulation for dimension is applied the formula does not yield an
integer. There are shapes that lie in a plane but if they are linearly scaled
by a factor L, the area does not increase by L squared but by some non integer
amount. These geometries are called fractals!
One of the simpler fractal shapes is the von Koch snowflake. The method of
creating this shape is to repeatedly replace each line segment with the
following 4 line segments.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro16.gif" width=172 height=52></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
The process starts with a single line segment and continues for ever. The first
few iterations of this procedure are shown below.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro17.gif" width=401 height=415></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
This demonstrates how a very simple generation rule for this shape can generate
some unusual (fractal) properties. Unlike Euclidean shapes this object has
detail at all levels. If one magnifies an Euclidean shape such as the
circumference of a circle it becomes a different shape, namely a straight line.
If we magnify this fractal more and more detail is uncovered, the detail is
self similar or rather it is exactly self similar. Put another way, any
magnified portion is identical to any other magnified portion. <p>
Note also that the "curve" on the right is not a fractal but only an
approximation of one. This is no different from when one draws a circle, it is
only an approximation to a perfect circle.
At each iteration the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. Thus
the limiting curve is of infinite length and indeed the length between any two
points of the curve is infinite. This curve manages to compress an infinite
length into a finite area of the plane without intersecting itself! Considering
the intuitive notion of 1 dimensional shapes, although this object appears to
be a curve with one starting point and one end point, it is not possible to
uniquely specify any position along the curve with one number as we expect to
be able to do with Euclidean curves which are 1 dimensional.
Although the method of creating this curve is straightforward, there is no
algebraic formula the describes the points on the curve.
Some of the major differences between fractal and Euclidean geometry are
outlined in the following table.
</p>

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro18.gif" width=454 height=103></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
Firstly the recognition of fractal is very modern, they have only formally been
studied in the last 10 years compared to Euclidean geometry which goes back
over 2000 years. Secondly whereas Euclidean shapes normally have a few
characteristic sizes or length scales (eg: the radius of a circle or the length
of of a side of a cube) fractals have so characteristic sizes. Fractal shapes
are self similar and independent of size or scaling. Third, Euclidean geometry
provides a good description of man made objects whereas fractals are required
for a representation of naturally occurring geometries. It is likely that this
limitation of our traditional language of shape is responsible for the sticking
difference between mass produced objects and natural shapes. Finally, Euclidean
geometries are defined by algebraic formulae, for example

defines a sphere. Fractals are normally the result of a iterative or recursive
construction or algorithm.

some replacement rules. Consider an initial string (axiom)

Recent usage of L-Systems is for the creation of realistic looking objects that
occur in nature and in particular the branching structure of plants.
One of the important characteristics of L systems is that only a small amount
of information is required to represent very complex objects. So while the
bushes in figure 9 contain many thousands of lines they can be described in a
database by only a few bytes of data, the actual bushes are only "grown" when
required for visual presentation. Using suitably designed L-System algorithms
it is possible to design the L-System production rules that will create a
particular class of plant.

<h3>IFS - Iterated Function Systems</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
Instead of working with lines as in L systems, IFS replaces polygons by other
polygons as described by a generator. On every iteration each polygon is
replaced by a suitably scaled, rotated, and translated version of the polygons
in the generator. Figure 10 shows two such generators made of rectangles and
the result after one and six iterations.
From this geometric description it is also possible to derive a hopalong
description which gives the image that would be created after iterating the
geometric model to infinity. The description of this is a set of contractive
transformations on a plane of the form
</p>
	
<center><IMG SRC="fracintro39.gif" width=202 height=53></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
each with an assigned probability. To run the system an initial point is chosen
and on each iteration one of the transformation is chosen randomly according to
the assigned probabilities, the resulting points (xn,yn) are drawn on the
page.
As in the case of L systems, if the IFS code for a desired image can be
determined (by something called the Collage theorem) then large data
compression ratios can be achieved. Instead of storing the geometry of the very
complex object just the IFS generator needs to be stored and the image can be
generated when required.
The fundamental iterative process involves replacing rectangles with a series
of rectangles called the generator. The rectangles are replaced by a suitably
scaled, translated, and rotated version of the generator.
</p>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td valign="top">

For example consider the generator on the right<p>

<p align="justify"> 
It consists of three rectangles, each with its own center, dimensions and
rotation angle. The initial conditions usually consist of a single square, the
first iteration then consists of replacing this square by a suitably
positioned, scaled and rotated version of the generator.

rectangles in the current system by suitably positioned, scaled, and rotated
versions of the generator resulting in the following

<b>Hopalong or "The Chaos Game"</b><p>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign="top">
<p align="justify">
A technique exists by which the resulting form after an infinite number of
iterations can be derived. This is a function of the form

<center><IMG SRC="fracintro45.gif" width=117 height=37></center><p>

<p align="justify"> 
This gives a series of (x,y) points all which lie on the result of an infinite
IFS. Although it still takes an infinite number of terms in this series to form
the result the appearance can be readily appreciated after a modest number of
terms (10000 say).

</td></tr></table>
<p>

<p align="justify"> 
Note that with both methods it is possible to create the image at any scale. In
many but not all cases zoomed in examples will be exhibit self similarity at
all scales.
Applications generally involve data reduction for model files. If a generator
can be found for a complex image then storing the generator and the rules of
production results in a great deal of data reduction. For example the weed in
the examples above might eventually contain over 2000 rectangles but is
completely specified by the characteristics of 3 rectangles, only 5 numbers,
center (cx,cy), scale (sx,sy), and angle (&oslash;)
Note: it is not necessarily trivial to derive a rectangular generator for an
arbitrary form, although it is possible to create a polygonal generator for any
form.
