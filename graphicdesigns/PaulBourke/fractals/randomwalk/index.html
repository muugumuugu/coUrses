The so called random walk involves a particle that moves in any direction with
a uniform random distribution. When implemented by computer to form an image, on 
each iteration the point can move in one of 8 directions: the 4 cardinal directions
and the 4 diagonals, each with equal probability. The following illustrates the nature
of the images formed, it is by no means a technical or theoretical treatment but intended
to give the reader a sense of the images formed. In the computer graphics domain these
are often used to provide a dirty appearance to textured objects.
Random walk is proposed as a first approximation to a number of physical process, such a molecular motion, and for some human driven processes such as the stock exchange fluctuations.

In this first example the number of iterations is low such that large portions of the
plane are not covered. In what follows, the images are greyscale where the level is
given by the number of times the particle passes through that pixel.

The following is an order of magnitude more iterations covering almost all pixels at
least once. The limit to infinity is a uniform density.

It is quite a good way to reveal how good a random number generator is, for example
the following is using the (poor) rand() function, the diagonal structure is obvious
for over 2000 million points.

The following uses the much better drand48() function.
The limit for this discrete random walk on a square lattice as the plane resolution increases is Brownian motion.

<p align="justify">
Since the direction is randomly chosen on each iteration from a uniform distribution,
if one accumulates the direction vector at each pixel the result should be a random
field.

The following is a zoom in of the accumulated direction vectors coloured from red to blue
to red mapped as a circular colour map from -pi to pi.
