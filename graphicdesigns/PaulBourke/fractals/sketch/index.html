Computer based design software and hardware has typically been tailored towards
producing sharp, precise drawings and images. Can the same technology also
generate more imprecise graphical output such as a rough conceptual sketch as
created by a human designer?
</p>

<p align="justify">
Two characteristics of a human sketch which do not occur in computer printed
output from CAD packages are
</p>
<ul>
<li>The endpoints of lines tend to overshoot at an intersection<p>
<li>Lines are not exactly straight but "wiggle"<p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
There are three ways these effects might be achieved. The first is to create or
modify an output device so that it can replicate the attributes of a human
drawer. There are possibilities here for robot arms which can easily be
designed to hold a variety of drawing implements and programmed to draw in
specified styles. A somewhat unusual attempt at computer sketching is to attach
a pen to a plotter loosely with elastic and tape, the result being that the pen
wobbles around during a plot giving the desired imprecise appearance.
</p>
<p align="justify">
A second technique is to modify the drawing instructions on their way from the
CAD software to the output device. For example the vectors could be intercepted
and changed to give the appearance of a human sketch before being forwarded to
the plotter.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The approach used here is to modify the geometry of a 3D model itself. Both of
the effects mentioned above are quite easy to simulate by computer using random
and fractal methods. Non-intersecting lines are achieved by extending both ends
of line segments by a random distance. The distance should be related to the
line length, the application I developed allowed a range of overshoots from
between zero and a user chosen maximum. The wiggly line effect was generated by
a well known technique from fractal geometry called "random midpoint
displacement". It takes a straight line segment and generates a fractal curve
by repeatedly splitting lines and perturbing their midpoint, the degree of
wiggle is easily controlled by the user.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Convincing sketches can be created with these techniques. It should be noted
that the result is a "3D sketch" from which hardcopy can be created from any
view and projection. The following examples are LaserWriter prints showing a
number of views of one of these 3D sketches with a selection of overshoot and
wiggle parameters.

Another noticeable effect of hand drawings is that the intensity is not
constant along a line and also varies within a drawing. Typically a line is
darker at the beginning and lighter near the end, lines also tend to be darker
for foreground items or parts of the drawing of particular interest.. While it
is not possible to maintain fine lines and introduce intensity on most
printers, it is possible to simulate this effect if a plotter is being used to
create the drawing. Plotters that fully support HPGL can have the pen speed,
acceleration, and  force set for any line segment. These pen properties will
not have the desired effect with most plotters pens but will if pencils are 
used.
