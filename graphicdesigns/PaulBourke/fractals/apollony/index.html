<h1>Apollony Fractal</h1>
<h3>Also known as the Apollonian Gasket or Curvilinear Sierpinsky Gasket</h3>

<p align="justify">
The Apollony fractal is created by starting with three mutually tangential
circles as shown below. 
</p>
<center><img src="1.gif" width=300 height=279></center><p>

<p align="justify">
There are two circles which have these three circles as their tangent, they
are called the inner and outer Soddy circles. The derivation of the
radius of the inner and outer
Soddy circles were studied by Frederick Soddy around 1936.
The Apollony fractal is created
by repeatedly filling the gaps between the circles with the inner Soddy
circle. The first two iterations are shown below.

<p align="justify">
The following is the Apollony fractal iterated to a "depth" of
1000 circles. The normal interpretation is to consider the plane to be
solid and the circles are cutting out holes, as such the area tends to
zero.
</p>
<center><img src="plan.gif" width=700 height=591></center><p>
<p align="justify">
The fractal dimension is approximately 1.3058. The name is attributed to
Apollonius of Perga who first proved that given any 3 circles that there
were 8 circles tangent to all three.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Apollony fractal can be represented in 3D space by turning each
circle into a sphere, three views of this are shown below (click on
the small image for a larger version). Note that the three large spheres
have been discarded so the internal structure is clearer.

The Apollonian gasket is usually the name
given to the form that results from the
same process described above but with an outer Soddy circle around the three
circles above. The inner Soddy circles are added
in the same way noting that the outer
circle can now be tangent to the added circles.

<b>3D</b><p>

<p align="justify">
In 3D one starts with 4 spheres each at the vertices of a tetrahedron.
A outer Soddy sphere is added that encloses the 4 spheres. The gaps are
filled by subsequent Soddy spheres thus forming a solid object (at infinity).
The result is often called an Apollonian sphere packing.
The fractal dimension of the 3D Apollonian has been calculated as
2.473946 [M. Borkovec, W. De Paris, and R. Peikert].
</p>

<p align="justify">
The following shows the top half of the 3D Apollonian, with the outer
and 4 tetrahedral spheres removed. As with most fractals, this is 
an approximation with "only" 40,000 spheres rather than the infinite
number required for the true fractal.
</p>
<center><img src="3d1.jpg" width=549 height=423></center><p>

<p align="justify">
This is the exterior of the whole Apollonian. Note the spheres are
shaded with a red to blue colour ramp depending on their radius 
except for the 4 tetrahedral spheres that are grey.
</p>

<p align="justify">
And finally, a view from the inside with the 4 tetrahedral spheres
removed of course. The first image is a standard perspective and the
second is a 180 degree fisheye.

<b>Attractor</b>
<p align="justify">
Kravchenko Alexei and Mekhontsev Dmitriy have 
found an attractor that creates the Apollony fractal,
the source code in Basic (by Roger Bagula) and C (by myself) are provided here:
<a href="roger.bas">roger.bas</a> and <a href="apollony.c">apollony.c</a>.
</p>
This is the union of three functions<br>
<center><table><tr><td>
f<sub>1</sub>(z) = f(z)<br>
f<sub>2</sub>(z) = 0.5 (-1 + s i) / f(z)<br>
f<sub>3</sub>(z) = 0.5 (-1 - s i) / f(z)<br>
</td></tr></table></center><p>
where z is complex, s=sqrt(3), and
</p>
<center>
f(z) = 3 / ( 1 + s - z) - (1 + s) / (2 + s)
