<b>Introduction</b><br>
<p align="justify">
FDC estimates the fractal dimension of an object represented as a 
black and white image where the object
to be analysed is assumed to be made up of the black pixels.
This is accomplished by an algorithm called "box-counting".
The application provided here is a upgrade to a very popular
application written for the Macintosh back in the early 90's.
This upgrade is provided for Mac OS-X (as a UNIX application).
An earlier application (no longer available) along with the documentation
can be found <a href="fdc_orig/index.html">here</a>, in what follows it will
be assumed the documentation for the earlier version has been
read.
</p>

<b>Brief theory</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Consider a line, if we subdivide the line in half then it takes two bits to
recreate the original line. 
If we subdivide the line into 4 pieces it takes 4 of them to
cover the line. We can write this generally, if we have a line segment
of length "s' then the number of segments that will cover the original line
is given by N(s) = (1/s)<sup>1</sup>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Consider a square, if we subdivide it into smaller squares each with 1/2 the
side length then it takes 4 of these smaller pieces to form the original square.
If we subdivide the square into smaller squares each with 1/4 of the side length
then it takes 16 of them to form the original square. As above we can write an
expression for the number of pieces we need of size "s" to cover the original
square, it is N(s) =  (1/s)<sup>2</sup>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Repeat for a cube....N(s) =  (1/s)<sup>3</sup>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The exponents 1, 2, and 3 in the above examples are fundamental to our concept
of the dimension involved. This can be generalised to N(s) =  (1/s)<sup>D</sup>
where D is
the dimension, an integer as above but it need not be. If we take logarithms of
both sides we have log(N(s)) = D log(1/s), in order words we can estimate the
dimension by plotting log(N(s)) against log(1/s) the slope of which is the
dimension, if it isn't an integer then it's a fractional (fractal) dimension.
</p>

<b>Screen dumps</b><bR>
<p align="justify">
A side goal for this project was to see to what extent graphical software
could be written and which would compile on multiple UNIX based system including
Mac OS-X. The aim was to create a single source version rather than have
any special case code for any particular platform. To this end, all the graphics
are created using OpenGL and the GLUT interface, all dialogs and user IO is
implemented with the Forms (xforms) library. So, it is assumed that OpenGL and X
are available, a fairly common situation.

<b>Download</b><br>
<p align="justify">
FDC is a Mac OSX application that can be freely downloaded for evaluation. It is fully functional
except that offset sampling (a critical feature for good estimates
of the fractal dimension) isn't enabled. This allows prospective
users to check the application runs on their system and performs
as expected before investing in a version which will compute more
reliable estimates of the fractal dimension. 
If you have any problems with these demo version please contact the author.
To obtain the full version with offset sampling enabled the shareware 
fee of US$30 is payable, preferably through PayPal.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Note than from Lion onward you may need to install X-Windows separately, it is
recommended you use <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">XQuartz</a>. Also, you
will need a 3 button mouse since the right mouse button is used for the menus. This
can be achieved by enabling the secondary mouse button on the Apple mice.

<b>Running FDC</b>
<p align="justify">
FDC can be run in either graphical mode where the user chooses options
and gets graphical feedback on the process or it can be run quietly.
FDC will present a window with the current image (it will be empty, white), from here
you can use the right mouse button (control click on a Mac with only
a single mouse button) to show the menus from where you can open a TGA
file (24 or 32 bit), set options, start and stop the processing, display the graph,
and save the results for further analysis.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The full list of command line options for FDC can be viewed by typing
"fdc -h", at the time of writing they are as follows.
</p>
<pre>
Usage: fdc [options]
General options
     -h      this text (help)
     -i s    load input TGA file
     -bw     invert image
     -q      quiet, command line mode
     -p      start processing immediately
Box options
     -n  n   number of offset samples, default: 10
     -b1 n   start box size (default: -1)
     -b2 n   end box size (default: 6)
     -bf n   box reduction factor (default: 1.2)
Region options
     -sl     left boundary (default: 0)
     -sr     right boundary (default: image width)
     -sb     bottom boundary (default: 0)
     -st     top boundary (default: image height)
</pre>
<p alig="justify">
So for example the command line to run the analysis on the image "snowflake.tga" 
(supplied in the FDC distribution) quietly with the results written to
standard output, using box sizes that range from 200 to 8 in factor
steps of 1.2 with 100 offset samples might be as follows. 
</p>
<pre>
   fdc -q -i snowflake.tga -b1 200 -b2 8 -n 100 -bf 1.2 > snowflake.dat
</pre>
<p align="justify">
The results in "snowflake.dat" will be something like the text on the left below.
Where the first column is the box size (s), the second column is the minimum
number of covering boxes (N), the third column is log(1/s), and the last
column is log(N). The estimate of the fractal dimension is the slope of this
graph. If the application is run in graphical mode, at the end of the
processing the graph window will look something like the image on the right.

The processing will generally run faster if the options and graph
window are hidden. It will run significantly faster if run in "quiet"
mode using the "-q" command line option. This is particularly important
if a large number of offsets are being used.
</p>

<b>Box size range</b>
<p align="justify">
The default range of box sizes is usually optimal but not always so.
They should only be changed when you have some experience and understanding
of the processes involved. The following graph is the result of performing
the box counting where the box size ranged from being 5 times the width
(or height) of the image to 1 pixel. For successful choice of the box size
range it is important to understand the regions of the graph illustrated here.

<b>Testing</b><br>
<p align="justify">
The following are some shapes for which the exact fractal dimension is known,
these can test the convergence and the dimension estimated using this software.
Note that for the examples below which have a fractal dimension one doesn't 
expect a perfect match to theoretical because the image is only an approximation
to the real fractal form. Note that since FDC assumes the object doesn't exist
outside the image area, the estimates for the Sierpinski Carpet are particularly
sensitive to this.

<b>Advanced topic: regional analysis</b><p>

It is possible to analyse just a portion of the image.
For example<br>
<pre>   fdc -sr 700 -sl 400 -sb 300 -st 600 -i gasket.tga</pre>
<br>
<center><img src="region1.gif" width=500 height=294></center><p>
<p align="justify">
 It is anticipated
that in normal operation the area of interest will be chosen in an image
editing page prior to analysing the fractal dimension.
The ability to
process just a region of the image is intended to be used with automatic
scripts to estimate the fractal dimension locally across the image, for
example, when the dimension is expected to vary across the image.
The approach that might be used is to slide a rectangular region
across the image estimating the dimension at each position, these estimates
can then be combined to form an image showing the dimensional variation.
This is similar to a sliding window used in signal processing to
calculate the Fourier spectrum variation of a time series.
There are two variables involved, the width of the window and the
distance between two successive window positions. Typically there is
significant overlap between the windows. The image below is formed by
analysing a gasket (image size 840 by 950) with a window width of 200
and a window step size of 20.
</p>
<center><img src="colourramp.jpg" width=509 height=64></center><p>
<center><img src="region2.gif" width=443 height=500></center><p>
<p align="justify">
The colour scale is a blue to green to
red colour ramp where blue is 1 and red is 2. The correct
dimension in this case is 1.585 hence the green appearance.
The white region is where
the window didn't intersect with any part of the image.
</p>
<center><img src="colourramp.jpg" width=509 height=64></center><p>
<p align="justify">
The window size and stepping are chosen based upon a trade-off between
temporal resolution and reliability of the dimension estimate. A large
window gives good estimates but low resolution (ability to detect local
variations in the dimension), while a small window gives good resolution
but poorer estimates. In the example above there are good estimates but
low resolution. In the example below a window of 50 is used with the same
stepping size of 20, here there is better resolution but poorer estimates.
</p>
<center><img src="region3.gif" width=436 height=500></center><p>
<p align="justify">
Please note that the above colour plots of the sliding window dimension
estimates is not part of the FDC package. FDC creates the data for the
above but it is up to user to turn that data into a suitable form for visual
inspection.

<h1>Ruler or Compass Dimension</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
October 1998<p>
Update June 2017, see <a href="index.html#compass2017">below</a> for an implementation
for vector data.<p>
<p aligh="justify">

<b>Introduction</b>

<p align="justify">
A "standard" method of estimating the length of a curve on a plane is
to count how many ruler lengths it takes to move from the start of the
curve to the end. Since the ruler has a finite length, the details of the
curve that are smaller than the ruler get skipped over and therefore
the length we measure
is normally less than the real length. This is illustrated below for
two rulers (red) of different length being used to estimate the length of
the curve in black.
</p>

<p><center><img src="ruler1.gif"></center>

<p align="justify">
Intuitively we believe that as our ruler gets shorter, our estimate of the
real length improves and increases. 
The estimate of the length on the right image above
is closer to the true length because it follows the curve more closely. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
This improved estimate as the ruler length decreases is certainly true 
for many curves (1 dimensional objects) but it is
not true for others. Such curves are referred to as fractals and they
have what is known as a fractal dimension between 1 and 2. Dimension
measured in this way is referred to as the Hausdorff Besicovitch
dimension.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Perhaps the most often quoted example is "How long is the coast of
Britain?". One could measure the length using a map and a compass set
to say a 50km radius. A better estimate would be achieved by using
smaller and smaller compass radii, each one revealing more and more
detail. One could go further and have someone walk around the coast,
they would still make decisions on how closely they followed the beach.
As one became more and more "precise" one would find more and more detail
about which to become precise about. As with most fractals in the real world
this process and therefore the fractal nature of the object is only
appropriate over some limited range of scales.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are many such examples in nature where the relationship between
the measured length and the ruler length is not linear, ie: 1 dimensional.
The outline of mountain ranges, clouds, and 
Brownian motion are another examples.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The ruler or compass dimension of a curve is computed from the 
relationship between
the length of a ruler and the number of rulers required to measure the
length of the curve.
This is given by
</p>

<p><center>N(l) = c l<sup>-D</sup></center>

<p align="justify">
where c is some constant. Taking logs of both sides<p>
<center>log(N(l)) = log(c) - D log(l)</center><p>
So if we plot log(N(l)) against log(l) for a range of values of l,
the slope will be an estimate of the fractal dimension D.
</p>

<b>Implementation</b>

<p align="justify">
The software described here estimates the length of a curve by measuring
it with successively shorter ruler lengths. The results when plotted
as described above give an estimate of the fractal dimension of the curve.
</p>

<table width=100% cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top width=70%>
<p align="justify">
The software requires a representation of the curve, 
this is as a file of (x,y) coordinates.
The file format is straightforward, it is a 
series of x,y pairs as either integers of floating point numbers, each
number and each pair are separated by any "white space" character (tab,
space, carriage return. linefeed, etc). 
The first few lines of such a file format  are shown on the right.

<br>
Note: only continuous curves are possible in this implementation.

<p align="justify">
The range of line lengths is varied
in powers of sqrt(2) from half the diagonal length of the 
bounding box of the curve to either<br>
- 1/512'th of the diagonal length, or<br>
- the length of the shortest line segment<br>
which ever occurs first.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As the software reduces the ruler it graphically shows the results.
The diagrams below are screen snapshots for the first 6 rulers 
analysing Brownian (1/f<sup>2</sup>) noise. The black line is the curve
being analysed, the blue lines are the ruler lines, and the red lines
are the compass radii.

<b>Update: Application to vector data. June 2017</a></b><p>

<p align="justify">
The above are applied to image representation of curves, this can be limiting
for many datasets that might have both large scale and fine grain detail thus
requiring very large image resolutions to effectively be represented as an image. There are
other problems in the reliability of the compass dimension estimates arising from
rasterisation of vector data. The software described here (vcompassdim) computes the compass
dimension for vector data in 2D. 
</p>
<pre>
Usage: vcompassdim [options] filename
Options
   -w n    Size of output image files, default: do not create
</pre>

<p align="justify">
The data is conveyed to the software through a text
file consisting of x,y pairs, each number and pairs can be separated by any white
space character but usually it is a space between x and y and a carriage return
before the next pair. The first few lines of an example data file might be as follows

As per the early fractal dimension estimators, before applying to real data the code
should be carefully tested against curves with known dimension. One such curve is
the Koch curve with a fracal dimension of log(4)/log(3) = 1.26. A vector form of that
curve is generated and the graph of log(l) vs log(N(l)) and linear curve fit shown
below.

is shown below, the black line is the curve read from the data file, the blue lines are
the rulers following the curve, and the red circles are the compass arcs.

Lacunarity was initially introduced as a means of further classifying fractals
and textures which had the same fractal dimension and a very different visual
appearance. Lacunarity is a measure of how the fractal fills space, if the
fractal is dense the lacunarity is small, the lacunarity increases with
coarseness.

<ul>
<li>These two definitions give identical results.<p>
<li>The object being studied is assumed to be made up of black pixels, all
non object pixels are white.<p>
<li>The value for a 1 pixel box (r = 1) reduces to the ratio of the white to
black pixels, most easily derived from the equations for method 1.<p>
<li>Only include those boxes which are totally enclosed within the boundary
of the image.<p>
<li>As the number of occupied pixels (black) tends to 0 the lacunarity
tends to infinity, so sparse data will generally have higher lacunarity
curves.<p>
<li>If lacunarity is plotted as log(L(r)) vs log(r) then fractals will
have straight line plots, in other words, they have similar appearance
across scales.<p>

<h1>Recurrence plots</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
January 1998
</center>
<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
Recurrence plots are used to reveal non-stationarity of a series 
as well as to indicate the degree of aperiodicity. 
They were first proposed by Eckmann et al around 1986 in order to
study phase space orbits. For example, for a stationary
system the recurrence plot should generally be homogeneous along
the diagonal.
</p>

Consider a series x with N terms<p>
<center>
x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4</sub>,
x<sub>5</sub>, .... x<sub>i</sub>, ..... x<sub>N-1</sub>
</center><p>

Form all the vectors y<sub>i</sub> of dimension (length) D with lag (delay) d.
<p><center>
y<sub>i</sub> = ( x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>i+d</sub>, x<sub>i+2d</sub>, .... )
<p>
D >= 2 and d >= 1
</center><p>
This is normally referred to as <b>embedding</b> x in dimension D with lag d.

<p align="justify">
The recurrence plot is formed by comparing all embedded vectors with each
other, and drawing points when the distance between two vectors is below
some threshold. More precisely, we draw a point at coordinate (i,j) if the
i'th and j'th embedded vectors are less than some distance r apart, eg: a
point is drawn if
</p>
<center>
||y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>|| < r
</center>
<p>
i is plotted along the horizontal axis, j on the vertical axis.
<p>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td valign=top>
<p align="justify">
If the recurrence plot contains a homogeneous but irregular distribution
of points then the series is mostly stochastic.
</p>

<p align="justify">
For example, for a random series (white noise with mean = 0, standard
deviation = 1) the recurrence plot is as shown below 
(d = 2, h = 1, r = 0.05)
</p>
<p align="justify">
Note that the recurrence plot is diagonally symmetric since the distance
of the i'th embedded vector to the j'th embedded vector is the same as
the distance of the j'th to the i'th. Also, there is a diagonal line where
i = j (the distance between the vectors is 0 and hence always less than
the threshold)

One of the difficulties is determining an appropriate distance r.
In the software developed here and listed below, the user can select
a value of r, the software then creates 3 recurrence plots with r/2,
r, and 2r. Another approach is to show all radii and to illustrate
this with a colour recurrence plot where the range of radii are mapped
onto different colours. In the example on the right the same sinusoid
is used as in the last example and the radius r is mapped onto a blue
to red colour map (blue = small r, red = large r).

The correlation integral is just the "density" of points on a
recurrence plot, that is, the number of points divided by the total
number of points in the plot.

C(r) = (number of times ||y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>|| < r) / N<sup>2</sup>
</center>
<p>

<p align="justify">
Note, the formulation includes the points along the diagonal where i = j.
Determining the slope of the correlation integral as a function of
log(r) gives the correlation dimension.
This is most efficiently computed from
a colour recurrence plot where, in general, all the distances have
been computed and one simply need to step through a range of radii
and count the number of cells with a distance less than the radius.

<p align="justify">
The usefulness of this result stems from an observation that the fractal
dimension of an attractor of a chaotic system exhibits self similarity.
It can be shown that the topological dimension of an embedding is the
same as the topological dimension of the underlying attractor as long
as the embedding dimension is large enough. Unfortunately there is no
straightforward way to determine what "large enough" is except by
computing the correlation dimension for a number of different embedding
dimensions.<br>
Note, the delay used for the embedding is normally taken to be at the
first zero of the auto-correlation function.

wish to make a recurrence map that is as wide and tall as the number of points
in the time series. The time series used in these examples is 2000 points wide
while the recurrence maps are 400 pixels wide an tall. This is solved by
sub-sampling but depending on the dimension and delay there can be a border
at the edge of the recurrence plot for which the calculations cannot be
performed (see the white fringe on the right and top of this recurrence plot).

Fractals usually possess what is called self similarity across scales.
That is, as one zooms in or out the geometry/image has a similar (sometimes
exact) appearance. The following will illustrate various types of
self similarity as well as present some real world examples.
</p>

<b>Exact self similarity</b><br>
<p align="justify">
The self similarity may be exact, this normally only occurs in mathematically
defined fractals where the realities/constraints on structures by
the physical world don't apply. The following example is the well
known Koch snowflake curve created by starting with a single line segment
and on each iteration replacing each line segment by four others 
shaped as follows <img src="piece.gif" width=46 height=15>.
As one successively zooms in the resulting shape is exactly the same
no matter how far in the zoom is applied.

<b>Approximate self similarity</b><br>
<p align="justify">
A far more common type of self similarity is an approximate one, that is,
as one looks at the object at different scales one sees structures that
are recognisably similar but not exactly so. An example of this in a 
mathematically defined system can be readily demonstrated by almost all
the patterns seen in the Mandelbrot set. The following show three successive
zooms and at each level a structure similar but not exactly the same as
the whole Mandelbrot set can be found.

<p align="justify">
Note that in the above example the self similar structure occurs at
discrete levels of scale while other systems like the Koch curve the
self similarity occurs at all scales.
</p>

<b>Statistical self similarity</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Sometimes the self similarity is isn't visually obvious but there may be
numerical or statistical measures that are preserved across scales. One
obvious measure might be the fractal dimension, in the example below of
1/f noise. the fractal dimension is constant as one zooms in.

<b>Example 1 - Terrain</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Consider the following image, is it on the scale of a large piece of 
rugged terrain photographed from an aeroplane, or the side of a mountain,
or a patch of dirt 
on the scale of a few meters, or a magnification of the surface
of a rough rock? Whichever it is, it could also easily be imagined to be
any one of the others. So one could start at the large scale view from the
air and apply successive zooms down to a microscopic scale, the surface
maintains self similarity across those scales.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As with most fractal structures found in nature, the self similarity
only occurs over a range of scales. In the above example, there is no 
self similarity as we zoom out to see the whole planet, or zoom in to
microscopic scales.
</p>

<b>Example 2 - Fern leaf</b><p>
<p align="justify">
In the case of the self similarity found in the fern, not only is there
a limit to the range of scales at which the self similarity occurs but
it also occurs at only at a few discrete scales.
</p>

<b>Example 3 - Tree branching</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Branching structures such as roots, capillaries, river networks often exhibit
self similarity across scales. In some cases, a young tree may be self similar
in time, namely, as it grows. A Bonsai tree is a good example (if a little
artificial) of this. The trees below, besides the fact that you can see them
in their context and thus scale, could easily be imagined to be anywhere in
size from a small shrub of 10cm, as they are at about 1m tall, and even as
small trees of 10 to 20m in height, or large trees of 100m. 
They would all pass for possible trees across that large range of scales.
