<b>Using Google?</b> (Reading Slashdot? 
<a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/slashdot.html">The followup story</a>)<p>
<b>Looking for images of quaternion fractals?</b><br>

<p align="justify">
On the 3rd of February 2004, this page (or rather the page that was here) was swamped 
by requests
and the server subsequentially failed. The reason was traced to Google introducing
a fractal looking logo (see below), which when clicked, performed an image
search for "julia" and "fractal". The two most interesting resulting 
images on the top row of the list were on this page (or rather the page that was here).
</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?q=julia+fractals">
<img src="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/julia.gif" width=320 height=125 border=0></a><br>
<font size=-1>[Image used without permission from Google]</font>
</center>

<p align="justify">
In order to get this server functional again, the pages that were here
have been moved somewhere
else. It shouldn't be too hard to find them if you really want to, do a
Google search for 
<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=fractal+quaternion">
"Quaternion fractal"</a> or if you would like to create your own Quaternion
fractals try <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POVRay</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Please note that this is not a criticism of Google but rather an interesting
dimension to the power they wield. They have hundreds (thousands?) of servers 
worldwide that distribute their traffic load. If even a small percentage of that
traffic is directed to a single server.....what chance does it have?
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Questions</b>: Should Google ask permission before potentially sending huge 
traffic loads to a single page/server? Should they regulate traffic to individual
sites/pages by changing the order of the search results?
Is it the responsibility of the
person who hosts the pages to protect her/himself? What are the good
govenance responsibilities of these large traffic funnelling services?
</p>
Happy searching!<p>
