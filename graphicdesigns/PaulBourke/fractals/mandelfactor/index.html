In doing work on fuzzy logic and tiling I have been looking at group
theory again. The simple groups are the cyclic rotational groups on the
unit circle that I use in my Sierpinski set work. I will develop a
factoring method of powered Mandelbrots:
</p>

1) z = z<sup>s</sup> + c
<p>

<p align="justify">
I will , then, show a five center factorization for the Mandelbrot set.
I will actually develop this for the equations of the type:
</p>

2) z = z<sup>n</sup> - c
<p>

<p align="justify">
The reason for this will become clear as I derive my results.
Let's start with:
</p>

3) z = z<sup>5</sup> - c
<p>

<p align="justify">
It is a four lobe figure. They are at right angles to each other. It is
a natural for a rotation of 90 degrees in group terms:
</p>

4) z = z * (z - a1) * (z - a2) * (z - a3) * (z - a4)
<p>

5) a1<sup>2</sup> = a2
<p>

6) a1<sup>3</sup> = a3
<p>

7) a1<sup>4</sup> = a4 = 1 
<p>

The solution for this is:
<p>

8) a1 = i and 4) becomes:
<p>

9) z = z * (z - i) * (z + 1) * (z + i) * (z - 1)
<br>
   z = z * (z<sup>2</sup> + 1) * (z<sup>2</sup> - 1)
<br>
   z = z * (z<sup>4</sup> - 1)
<br>
   z = z<sup>5</sup> - z
<p>

So how do we get  3) out of this? We let :
<p>

10) ac1 = i * (c / z)<sup>0.25</sup> and the equation is:
<p>

11) z = z * (z - i * (c / z)<sup>0.25</sup>) * (z + 1 * (c / z)<sup>0.25</sup>) * 
(z + i * (c / z)<sup>0.25</sup>) * (z - 1 * (c / z)<sup>0.25</sup>)
<p>

<p align="justify">
Which following through the steps in 9) above gives 3). These are the
fixed points that result in the four lobes. Now I have experimentally 
found five attractors for the Mandelbrot set.  If we substitute in:
</p>

12) z -&gt; z<sup>0.4</sup> and 
<p>

13) ac1 -&gt; i * (c / z)<sup>0.1</sup> into 11) we get:
<p>

14) z = z<sup>2</sup> - c
<p>

<p align="justify">
So we have the conjugate to the Mandelbrot set  with five attractor
points! Lets do 9) backwards from the positive instead of the negative:
</p>

15) z = z<sup>5</sup> + z ( a Newtons algorithm type)
<br>
    z = z * (zs<sup>4</sup> + 1)
<br>
    z = z * (z<sup>2</sup> + i) * (z<sup>2</sup> - i)
<br>
    z = z * (z + i * sqr(i)) * (z - i * sqr(i)) * (z + sqr(i)) * (z - sqr(i))
<p>

<p align="justify">
So in all cases above just adding the Sqr(i) term  makes the Mandelbrots
come out. So lets put it altogether in 11):
</p>

16) z1 = z<sup>0.4</sup>
<p>

17) c1 = (c / z)<sup>0.1</sup>
<p>

18) z = z1 * (z1 + i * sqr(i) * c1) * (z1 - i * sqr(i) * c1) * 
(z1 + sqr(i) * c1) * (z1 - sqr(i) * c1)
<p>

<p align="justify">
That equation gives a factorization of the limiting attracting fixed
points of the Mandelbrot set. It has taken me years to get where I can
do this. The relationship of groups and fractals has been a theme in my
work from the beginning. In the special unitary groups there is a
pairing relationship  of SU(2) and SU(5) . The moment of inertia of a
sphere is:
</p>

19) I = m * rs<sup>2</sup> * (2/5)
<p>

<p align="justify">
So that the power of 2/5 here isn't totally surprising. In my Sierpinski
set dimensional spectra work, I had estimated that the dimensionality of
the Mandelbrot set was:
</p>

20) hd = log(5) / log(2)
<p>

<p align="justify">
That idea came from the five attractor points and the observed limiting
similarity scaling effects. I don't have an actual numerical solution
for these limiting attractor points yet, but at least I have a better
method than before! The actual nature of these equations suggests that
the Mandelbrot set is not Sierpinski in nature, but Eisenstein fraction!
It is the reverse sign and zero center that give it that 
characteristic. Since the Julia sets of the Mandelbrot set have the same
form, the same factors apply. The observation of a phase between three
points and five points in experimentation, indicates a degeneracy
between these attractors happens when the constant is right. The
question of what:
</p>

21) z = z<sup>0.4</sup> + c
<p>

<p align="justify">
Might have as a shape also seems important from the similarity type
argument.
Knowledge is a long term process with fits and starts and mistakes.
This article using group theory seems to answer some long term problems,
but more questions are raised as a result. If I had given up several
years ago when I got negative feed back on my ideas about the Mandelbrot
set, I would never have gotten this far. The strange negative
directional onesidedness of the Mandelbrot set seems to be due to two of
the centers moving to the same side in the limiting case in a way much
like the golden mean. An attractor set like:
</p>

22) Set = {0, -gm1, -gm2, i, -i} : 
gm1 = (1 + sqr(5)) / 2: gm2 = gm1 - 1
<p>

<p align="justify">
Would have the right kind of properties for what we observe.
