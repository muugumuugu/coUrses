<h1>POVRay Fractal Raytracing Contest</h1>
<h3><a href="final/index.html">Final Results</a></h3>
Maintained by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p align="justify">
The aim of this competition is to create a visually compelling image  
of a 3D fractal form using the POVRay raytacing program. Since fractals in general
can only be approximated by computer graphics, the emphasis is to create as faithful a
geometric representation as possible.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This is intended to be a friendly competition between POVRay aficionados and
fractal enthusiasts. Over and above the respect and awe of her/his peers
a prize will be awarded to the winner, namely 
"The Loom of God, Mathematical Tapestries at the Edge of Time" by Clifford Pickover.
<p>

</ul>
<p>

<b>Rules</b><br>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
	A valid entry will consist of a single text file less than 10,000 bytes in length.
	Entrants are encouraged to make use of the programming capabilities in POVRay
	rather than using data files.
	</p>
<li><p align="justify">
	Entries are limited to two per person, this is intended to encourage high quality
	entries rather than quantity.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
	The POVRay scene file entered must be totally self contained and not rely
	on any external files (eg: #include files or TTF files).
	This is mainly for the benefit of the entrants
	who therefore need not worry about the exact configuration of the machine the
	entries will be rendered on.
	</p>
<li><p align="justify">
	The image to be judged will be rendered using POVRay 3.5 running on a 
	reasonably well endowed Linux machine, eg: dual processor 
	2.8Ghz P4 with 2GB RAM. The rendering
	process must take less than 10 hours on such a machine and use less than
	the 2GB or memory. If you think your entry may come close to these bounds
	then it is suggested you review your entry.
	</p>
</ul>

<b>Submission</b><br>
<p align="justify">
An entry to the contest 
will include the POVRay model, a title, and some optional comments.
The only compulsory part of the entry is obviously the POVRay text, it is 
this file that will be rendered by POVRay at 800x800 pixels to form the 
image to be judged.
The comments may include a description of the image, the motivation, any tricks
employed, references, etc.
</p>

<!--
<p align="justify">
When you've created your masterpiece and have checked it carefully, hit the button 
below to submit it.
</p>
<center>
   <form action="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/cgi-bin/button.cgi?rendering/povfrac/submit.html" method="post">
      <input type="submit" value="S u b m i t    y o u r   entry">
   </form>
</center><p>
-->

<p align="justify">
Each entry will be rendered with the default POVRay settings along with
the following <a href="ini.txt">".ini" file</a>. 
The image will be rendered by POVRay to a TGA file and
converted to ".jpg" using the UNIX "convert" program with the quality option
set to 95%.
</p>

<b>Voting</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Voting is open to anyone, and there will be three prizes awarded based upon the
number of votes received. Each person voting will choose their three favourite images
in order of preference.
A first choice will get 3 points, the second will get 2 points, and the third choice 1 point.
The voting process will be made as transparent as possible, however the coordinator
(me) exercises the right to decide upon any matter in dispute.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition to the above, a small panel of critics with either a professional digital arts 
background or with extensive fractal experience will be invited to vote independently 
and comment/critique 
entries they find notable. The members of the panel will be announced in due course.
</p>

<p align="justify">
After the winners have been announced, the top ranking images, source code, 
and any additional information provided by the entrant will be included on a WWW page
in the form of a gallery.
