<h1>Tides</h1>

<p><hr><p>

If asked what causes the tides most people would answer immediately, "the moon".
They would be correct, however the general mechanism is generally not
understood. Further you might know that it is the gravitational attraction
of the moon which causes the ocean to be attracted towards the moon
thus causing a tide, again you would be correct...<b>however</b>...
<p>
There are two facts which you might ask yourself to test your understanding
of how tides work.
<p>

<b>First</b>, the gravitational attraction on a mass on the surface
of the earth due to the sun is about
50 times stronger than that of the moon. 
(The force is proportional to the mass of the sun and inversely proportional to
the square of the distance)
Why then should the moon cause
the tides, it has a relatively small contribution to the gravitational force
on a parcel of water?

<b>Second</b>, why do we get two (almost) tides per day? Given that the moon 
travels around the earth in about 28 days then its motion across our sky is
mostly due to the earths rotation which of course spins
around once per day. Thus
wouldn't we expect only one tide per day. ie: if the oceans bulge towards
the moon then the bulge moves around the earth once per day.

A correct understanding of the tides explains both the above.
