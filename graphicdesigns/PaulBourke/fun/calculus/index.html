Quite often one comes across seemingly mysterious objects in fractal
geometry that have, say, zero volume and infinite surface area (see
the <a href="../../fractals/polyhedral/index.html">menger sponge</a>). 
There are however non intuitive results from more
classical calculus and geometry, here's an example....
</p>

<p align="justify">
Consider the curve y = f(x) = 1/x from x=1 to infinity. Now rotate this
curve into the z axes, around the x axis to form a curved cone-like
object. A plane perpendicular to the x axis
that cuts this surface of revolution is a circle with a radius of 1/x.
The circumference of this circle is 2pi/x and the area of this circle is
pi/x<sup>2</sup>.

This is sometimes known as Gabriel's horn or Gabriel's Trumpet.

<p align="justify">
The volume is the integral of pi/x<sup>2</sup> with respect
to x evaluated between 1 and infinity, this is finite, namely pi.

The surface area of our curved cone is infinite.

<font size=+1>We are left with the inescapable 
conclusion that our curved cone can hold
finite amount of paint (the volume is finite) but we could never paint the
outside surface (the surface area is infinite).</font>
