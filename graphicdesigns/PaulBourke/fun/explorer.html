An explorer needs to cross a desert that takes 6 days on foot.
He/she will need to hire bearers to take food because any one
person can only carry enough food and water for 4 days.
What is the smallest number of bearers needed? <br>
ps: It isn't acceptable to leave the bearers in the desert to die.
