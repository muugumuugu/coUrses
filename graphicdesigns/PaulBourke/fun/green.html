<h1>Why are plants green?</h1>
</center>
<p><hr><p>

The "standard" answer is because of the pigment chlorophyll.<p>

But why, since sunlight has most of its energy in the yellow-green
part of the spectrum, do plants reject (reflect) these most abundant
wavelengths? Normally evolution finds optimal solutions, the optimal
solution here would seem to be to absorb the yellow green wavelengths
instead of reflecting them.
