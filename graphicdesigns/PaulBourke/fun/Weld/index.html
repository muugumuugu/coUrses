<p align="justify">
Presented here are digital assets captured from a rock shelter site located in the Weld
Range, Western Australia. 
The shelter being called either WeldRSAQ-10218 (research title) or Yallabilli Mindi.
While this is an informal image/movie gallery to give the reader
a sense of the site and surrounding landscape, it is also an example of the digital assets
and recordings that can be captured as part of the archaeology of significant indigenous sites.
</p>

<b>Panorama</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Gigapixel panorama captured from a point directly above the cave.
Due to the remoteness and terrain this is taken "hand held", comprising of 20 photographs
using a 22MPixel SLR camera.

<b>Gigapixel</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Partial gigapixel panorama from the cave mouth.
Made up from 80 photographs and motorised head.

<b>Bubbles</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Three node "tour" of the cave. Each node (bubble) is created by taking 3 or 4 photographs with a fisheye
lens. They capture everything visible from the position at which they are taken.

<b>3D reconstruction</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Animated camera path (click for QuickTime movie, half original HD resolution)
based upon the 3D reconstructed model.
The reconstruction is entirely automated and in this case based upon 175 photographs.
The underlying model serves as the main asset for an interactive virtual experience.

<p align="justify">
Composite images illustrating the computer generated nature of the reconstructions.
Greyscale and wireframe sections reveal the geometric resolution, noting this particular
example has triangles about a factor of 2 larger than what is achievable.

<b>Little Planet</b><p>

<p align="justify">
Little planet view from the mouth of the cave.
This is generated from the bubble photographs presented above using the technique
documented <a href="../../panorama/littleplanet/index.html">here</a>.
