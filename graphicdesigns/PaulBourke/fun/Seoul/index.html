<h1>Seoul (South Korea) in half a day</h1>

<p align="justify">
From the title one might imagine this is going to tell you how to see Seoul in
half a day, instead it is a record of half a day I spent in Seoul. In many ways
Seoul is just like any other large city in the region but one can still manage
to find places devoid of tourists and quirky things unique to Seoul.
</p>




<b>Trains</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The train system is by far the easiest way to get around and very affordable, most
trips being under AU$1. The trains are clean and run every 5 to 10 minutes, perhaps
the only rival I've experienced would be Japan. The routes are colour coded and signage
clear. From the airport you have a choice of a train service, personally I think the
buses are better (about AU$15) for a very comfortable "limousine" bus. 
If you are staying in a major hotel they will go directly, if your hotel
isn't one of them then go to the closest and get a taxi from there. The train service
is faster but you miss seeing much of the city since it is underground and you still
need to negotiate your way to your hotel.

	There seem to be two types of ticket, short/single trip and a rechargeable card. If you plan
	to use the trains more than once the rechargeable cards (Seoul CityPass)
	are the way to go, just swipe them
	on the gates into or out of
	each station and your current charge and balance will be displayed.
	Actually I wonder what the point of the single trip tickets is.
	It can be a bit of a challenge getting your first card because while the single trip
	machines have an "English" button, the rechargeable cards don't seem to but rather
	have a mixture of Korean and English on each screen ... in variable degrees.
	The whole system is very simple, after you've done it once. There are sometimes
	attendants at the main stations who can help.

	There are some disturbing cabinets in each station with gas masks along with instructions.

If you plan to travel by train (which I recommend) you may want to make sure you are
in shape. There were too many long sets of stairs for my liking especially as the
day wears on. There are frequent escalators but they seem to get less common the
further out you go and they are frequently out of order.

<b>Gwacheon National Science Museum and planetarium</b><p>

<p align="justify">
The National Science Museum (called the "Scientorium")
is of exceptional quality and packed with patrons during
the week day and the Saturday I visited. It is located within the Seoul Grand Park
so there are lots of things to do in the surrounding area including an amusement park,
botanical gardens, and the zoo.

</center><p>

<p align="justify">
The planetarium is equally of exceptional quality. It is 25m diameter and driven by
a dual optomechanical system and a high quality digital projection system, supplied
by Konico Minolta as a beautifully integrated system. The presenter was very professional,
I assume accurate but it was in Korean so I can't be sure. As per many digital planetariums
the show consisted of a traditional star/constellation discussion followed by a fulldome
show, in this case run using "Digital Sky".

<b>Seodaemun Prison and Dongnimmun Independence Gate</b><p>

<p align="justify">
This whole complex (prison and independence gate) are dedicated to the patriots
who were tortured and generally died during the Japanese occupation. The engraved mural
tells the occupation story from both ends, celebratory independence in the middle. The
names of the patriots are engraved in the marble below the mural, they can also be
found lining the wall of the Dongnimmun train station.

<p align="justify">
The prison tour is interesting although clearly some nasty things went on there
towards the members of the resistance against Japanese occupation. 
The various buildings (building started around 1908) 
are the "Execution building" and the "Corpse removal unit".
The women's prison (built in 1916) is particularly depressing with it's tiny underground cells.

<b>Gyeongbokgund Palace</b> (The palace greatly blessed by heaven)<p>

<p align="justify">
The site was the original site for the royal palace back in 1395, but it has been
torn down and rebuilt a couple of times since then. First by the Japanese around 1592 during
the Hideyoshi invasion and then again destroyed during the Japanese occupation.
It was originally built when the dynasty moved from Gaegyeong to Seoul, as such it
used to occupy the center of the city.

	Unfortunately while the site and buildings are fascinating this is a classic 
	example of how the experience at such touristic sites is reduced by the large
	crowds. The view of the inner part of the palace (throne hall) shown on the right is only
	achieved by "fighting" ones way through crowds attempting similar photographs.
	I was there on a Saturday, perhaps it is busier then due to the addition of
	local visitors.

<p align="align">
There is a major shopping/market street close to the palace, but frankly the stores
flip between selling cheap nasty trinkets to the other extreme, lovely works of art
but with more than a matching price tag. But if you are looking for something special
and have the budget then you'll find it here.

<b>Dongdaemum Market</b><p>

<center><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 width=100%><tr><td width=50%>
	<p align="justify">
	These markets are much more interesting and there's a flea market a few blocks
	away, it is sign posted on the roads. A canal runs down the middle, on one side
	there is a strip of pet/animal stores. Everything you could want from iguanas to
	eagles, mice to ferrets. The other side of the canal is mostly clothing, of the
	cheap variety. Lots of fun walking around these markets even though
	I doubt many visitors actually buy anything.

<b>Gangbyeon Techno Market</b><p>

<p align="justify">
This sounded like a place to find the latest gadgets, not so. While it isn't clear
in the photo, the first 4 or 5 floors are occupied by camera stores, the top 2 or 3
are almost exclusively mobile phones. These are also very large floor areas, in the
case of the cameras each 3rd store or so was selling the same brand. There are only a 
certain number of products that Canon say, sell and each store seemed to have the whole
range of cameras and lenses. I really don't see how a particular store distinguishes
itself, none of them were particular busy. Similarly for the mobile phones,
literally hundreds of outlets each with hundreds of phones for sale,
there can't possibly be that number of different models and brands.

Drink vending machines litter street corners and the train stations. Its hard to work out

coffee.
