You are the ruler of an empire and you decide to have a party, one month
from now. You've got 1000 bottles of wine and you find out that one of them
is poisoned. The actual poison takes a little less than a month to have an
effect (deadly). You do have a lot of servants at your disposal. What is the
smallest number of servants you must have to drink from the bottles to find
the poisoned bottle?
