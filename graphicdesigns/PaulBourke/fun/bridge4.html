<h1>4 men crossing a bridge</h1>
</center>

<p><hr><p>

There are 4 men who want to cross a bridge. They all begin
on the same side. You have 17 minutes to get all of them across to
the other side. It is night. There is one flashlight. A maximum of
two people can cross at one time.
<p>
Any party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the
flashlight with them. The flashlight must be walked back and
forth, it cannot be thrown, etc. Each man walks at a different
speed. A pair must walk together at the rate of the slower man's
pace. 
<p>
Man 1: 1 minute to cross<br>
Man 2: 2 minutes to cross<br>
Man 3: 5 minutes to cross<br>
Man 4: 10 minutes to cross
<p>
For example if Man 1 and Man 4 walk across first. 10
minutes have elapsed when they get to the other side of the
bridge. If Man 4 returns with the flashlight. A total of 20
minutes have passed and you have failed the mission.
