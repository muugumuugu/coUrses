Three trekkers met on a hill side during their lunch time and agreed to share their 
bread. One of them brought 5 large breads and another brought 3 large breads on to 
table. All breads were of equal size. The third person didn't have any bread 
with him, but offered to pay 8 dollars for an equal share of the available bread.   
All of them agreed, shared the bread equally and ate their lunch. The gentleman 
paid 8 dollars and left the bread-contributors to split the money between them, as 
appropriate. How should they fairly split the money?
