<h1>3 Switches</h1>
Submitted by Dennis Bell
</center>

<p><hr><p>

You are standing outside the first floor entrance to a building.  Next to
you is a bank of 3 light switches.  One of the switches controls a light
bulb in a stock room on the second floor.  The other two switches don't
control anything.  The only way you can check the light on the second floor
stock room is to physically walk up the stairs, open the door to the stock
room, and check the light.  You can do anything to the switches that you
want before you walk up the stairs, however you are allowed only one trip
up the stairs to check the light.  
Assuming the light and switches are 
off to start with, how do you find out which 
light switch controls the light using only one trip to the room?
