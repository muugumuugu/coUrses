<p align="justify">
A mischievous Sheik dies and leaves 17 horses to his three sons.  To the
eldest, he leaves half his horses; to the middle son, one-third; and to
the youngest, one-nineth.  In consternation the brothers seek the wise
man of the village for advice.  The wise man adds his own horse to the
group and makes the following division: 9 horses to the eldest; 6 to the
middle son, 2 to the youngest.  Then the wise man takes his own horse,
now left over, and goes home.
