<h1>Bee and the Locomotives</h1>

<p align="justify">
There are 2 railway stations, A and B, connected by a winding dual
railway track, 100km long. There is a locomotive at each station and
the locomotive at station A has a bee on it, asleep in the sunshine.
At precisely the same time both locomotives start up and head off
toward the other station. The blast of the engine wakes the bee and
frightens it, so it zooms off up the track at it's top speed of 90km/h.
The locomotives themselves only travel at 50km/h so the bee gets clear
and zooms away until it suddenly comes across the other locomotive
coming the other way which scares the hell out of it and it turns around
and flies back the way it came. Until it once again comes across the 
first locomotive still puffing along, at which point the bee turns
around again and flies back until it meets the other approaching
locomotive, etc. Until finally the bee finds itself imminently 
threatened on both sides by the locomotives and, not understanding 
the fact that they each have their own track, it thinks that it is
about to be squashed and expires of fright.
</p>
How many kilometers did the bee travel during this episode?
