It is possible to make an accurate computation of the temperature of Heaven 
using a physical law called Stefan - Boltzmann law which gives the power radiated
from a black body given its temperature.
The clue as to the temperature of heaven
follows from data available in the bible. Isiah 30:28 reads:

<i>"Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, 
and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days".</i>
</td></tr></table></center>

<p align="justify">
Thus heaven receives from the moon as much radiation as we do from the sun and in addition seven times seven (ie: 49 times) as much as earth does from the sun. This gives 50 times in all!
This radiation falling on heaven heats it to the point where the heat loss by 
re-radiation <img src="http://paulbourke.net/fun/heaven/heaven1.jpg" width=12 height=12 border=0> just 
equals the heat received by radiation. So from Stefan - Boltzmann law 4'th power law we have

<p align="justify">
Taking T (the absolute temperature of earth) as 300K, we obtain 
a temperature of 798K, or about 525 Celsius.
It is tempting to compare this unexpectedly warm temperature with that of Hell. 
Although we cannot be exact about the temperature of hell, we can conclude an upper limit. 
Revelations 21:8 reads:

<i>"But the fearful and unbelieving ... 
shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone ..."</i>
</td></tr></table></center>

<p align="justify">
The boiling point of brimstone (sulphur) is 444.6 degrees C, 
which means that the temperature of such an eternal lake must be 
less than 444.6 degrees C (otherwise if would evaporate).
Therefore, as 444.6 is much less than 525.0, we are forced to 
conclude by Physical and Biblical data, that:
