<h1>Walking Distance Problem</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>

<p><br><p>

Consider walking between two points A and B where the vertical
and horizontal distance between them is 1km. Walking as shown in the
following diagram would take 2km.

Now split up the trip into the 4 half km trips as shown below, the
trip still takes 2 km to reach B from A.

Lets refine the trip even further into quarter km steps, the total
distance travelled is still 2 km. Indeed, as we continue to split up
the trip into smaller and smaller steps the total travel distance
remains 2km.

However, as the step size reduced to zero, the travel path is along
the diagonal and the travel distance is now suddenly only the square root
of 2!

What's wrong with this argument, why does the travel distance suddenly
drop from 2 to 1.414....?
