<h1>Missing Money</h1>
</center>
<p><hr><p>

Three men in a cafe order a meal the total cost of which is $10.
They each contribute $5, the waiter takes the money to the chef
who recognises the three as friends and asks the waiter to
return $5 to the men.  The waiter is not only poor at maths but
dishonest and instead of going to the trouble of splitting the $5
between the three he simply gives them $1 each and pockets the
remaining $2 for himself.<p>
Now, each of the men effectively paid $4, the total paid is
therefore $12. Add the $2 in the waiters pocket and this comes to
$14.....where has the other $1 gone from the original $15?
