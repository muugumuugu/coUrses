<h1>Minus One</h1>

<br><p>
A carpenter named Charlie Bratticks<br>
Who had a taste for mathematics<br>
One summer Tuesday, just for fun<br>
Made a wooden cube side minus one<p>

Though this to you may seem wrong<br>
He made it minus one foot long<br>
Which meant (I hope your brains aren't frothing)<br>
Its length was one foot less than nothing<p>

Its width the same (you're not asleep?)<br>
And likewise minus one foot deep<br>
Giving, when multiplied (be solemn)<br>
Minus one cubic foot of volume<p>

With sweating brow this cube he sawed<br>
Through areas of solid board<br>
For though each cut had minus length<br>
Minus times minus sapped his strength<p>

A second cube he made, but thus<br>
This time each one foot length was plus<br>
Meaning of course that here one put<br>
For volume, plus one cubic foot<p>

So now he had, just for his sins<br>
Two cubes as like as deviant twins<br>
And feeling one should know the worst<br>
He placed the second in the first<p>

One plus, one minus - there's no doubt<br>
The edges simply cancelled out<br>
So did the volume, nothing gained<br>
Only the surfaces remained<p>

Well may you open wide your eyes<br>
For those were now of double size<br>
On something now, thanks to his skill<br>
Took up no room and measured nil<p>

From solid ebony he'd cut<br>
These bulky objects, but<br>
All that remained was now a thin<br>
Black sharply angled sort of skin<p>

Of twelve square feet - which though not small<br>
Weighed nothing, filled no space at all<br>
It stands there yet on Charlies floor<br>
He can't think what to use it for<p>
