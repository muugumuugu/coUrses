In a country (to remain unnamed) it was decided to increase the 
number of males. The proposal was to allow each family to have
as many children as they want but only one girl. In other words,
as soon as a family had one girl they could have no more children.
As long as they had all boys they could keep having children.
<br>
Would this achieve the desired result of increasing the male population?
