<h1>Goodsteins Theorem</h1>
Written by <a href="../index.html">Paul Bourke</a><br>
January 1997
</center>
<p><br><p>

<p align="justify">
Goodstein's theorem is an example of a G&ouml;del theorem for the mathematical
process of induction, that is, given the correctness of mathematical
induction, then we must believe Goodstein's theorem even though it cannot
be proved by mathematical induction.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Consider a series generated as follows: starting with any number N,
represent that number using only powers of a single base, say 2 (see example).
Write all exponents also in their base 2 expansion.
To form the next term in the series increase each digit of the current
base by 1 and subtract 1 from the resulting number.
Goodstein's theorem states that such a series tends to zero.
</p>

<b>Example 1</b><br>
<p align="justify">
This is best illustrated with an example, lets start with the number
25. It can be written using only powers of 2 as follows<br>
<center>
25 = 2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>1</sup></sup></sup> + 
     2<sup>2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup></sup> +
     2<sup>0</sup>
</center><br>
<p align="justify">
This is often referred to as hereditary representation of a base, 2 in
this case.
In the following discussion I will simply use 1 for 2<sup>0</sup> and
2 for 2<sup>1</sup> as it simplifies the expressions and makes no difference
to the procedure. So 25 is represented as
</p>
<center>
25 = 2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup> + 2<sup>2 + 1</sup> + 1
</center>
</p>
So, to get the next term in the series we increment the base digit,
currently 2 and then subtract 1. The next term is then<br>
<center>
3<sup>3<sup>3</sup></sup> + 3<sup>3 + 1</sup> = 7625597485068
</center>
<p>
The next term is<br>
<center>
4<sup>4<sup>4</sup></sup> + 4<sup>4 + 1</sup> - 1
</center><br>
which is reduced to powers of the current base "4" to<br>
<center>
4<sup>4<sup>4</sup></sup> + 3 * 4<sup>4</sup> + 3 * 4<sup>3</sup> +
	3 * 4<sup>2</sup> + 3 * 4 + 3
</center>
This is a very big number indeed, namely<p>
134078079299425970995740249982058461274793658205923933777
235614437217640300735469768018742981669034276900318581864
86050853753882811946569946433649006085119.....
<p>
The next term is<p>
<center>
5<sup>5<sup>5</sup></sup> + 3 * 5<sup>5</sup> + 3 * 5<sup>3</sup> +
        3 * 5<sup>2</sup> + 3 * 5 + 2
</center>
which is a number of <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fun/goodstein/bignumber.txt">2216 digits</a>!
<p>
<p align="justify">
It is important to understand what happened in the second to last term above,
this is the how the number is expressed in power of the current base of 4.
The subsequent terms of the series only have the current base digit increased!
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Goodstein's theorem states that this series tends to zero!</b>
In 1944 R. L. Goodstein proved that this is the case for any natural
number. Goodstein's theorem cannot be proved in Peano Arithmetic 
(ie: formal Number Theory).
</p>

<b>Example 2</b><p>
<p align="justify">
The first example above obviously leads to unmanageable numbers, how about
more modest starting points. 0 obviously isn't very interesting. 1 
tends to 0 on the first iteration. 2 and 3 are also trivial. 
4 is at last interesting, the sequence starts off simple enough:
4, 26, 41, 60, 83, 109, .... but then one needs to wait for an
enormous number of iterations before it starts to decrease, 
finally arriving at 0.

</pre>

<p align="justify">
The square term will not be "alone" for about 3*2^27 further iterations,
that is, about 402 million iterations.
The series does not reach zero for another 10 followed by over 121
zeros later!
The outcome of the Goodstein series for 5 and above will be left as
an exercise for the reader. :-)
