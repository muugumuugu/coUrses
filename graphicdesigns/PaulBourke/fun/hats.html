<h1>Black and white hats</h1>

A king wants his daughter to marry the most logical of 3 intelligent
princes, and so comes up with a test for them.
<p>
The princes are gathered into a room and seated, facing one another, and
are shown 2 black hats and 3 white hats. They are blindfolded, and 1 hat
is placed on each of their heads, with the remaining hats hidden in a
different room.
<p>
The king tells them that the first prince to correctly identify the
color of his hat will marry his daughter. A wrong guess will mean death.
<p>
The blindfolds are then removed. You are one of the princes, you see 2
white hats on the other prince's heads. What color is your hat?
