A 120 wire cable has been laid between two telephone exchanges located
10km apart. Unfortunately after the cable was laid it was discovered to
be the wrong type, the problem is the individual wires are not labelled. 
There is no visual way of knowing which wire is which and thus connections
at either end is not immediately possible. You are a trainee technician and
your boss has asked you to identify and label the wires at both ends. 
You have no
transport and only a battery and light bulb to test continuity. You do have
tape and pen for labelling the wires.
</p>
<p align="justify">
What is the shortest
distance you will need to walk to correctly identify and label each wire?
