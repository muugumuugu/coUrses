A man goes to work every day at 7 and comes home at 5. He lives
on the 10th floor. Every morning he goes down with the lift 	from
10th to the ground. in the afternoon he comes back and goes up with the
elevator but only to the 5th floor. He walks the 	rest. That is
not because he wants to but because he must.  Why?
