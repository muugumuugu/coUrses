<h1>House Expansion</h1>
</center>
<p><hr><p>

The owner of a square house wishes to double the size of the dwelling but
wants to maintain the square shape. As can be seen in the diagram there
are 4 trees, one at each corner of the house.
The owner does not wish to remove or shift the trees and doesn't want
to build a second storey or a basement.<br>

How does the owner achieve the expansion?
