<h1>Truth - Lie</h1>
</center>
<p><hr><p>

Trekking in the deepest jungles of Bwean you come to a fork in the path.
One path leads to Bweat, the capital of Bwean, the place you want to go.
There is a Bweanian standing by the fork in the path and you know
from experience that depending on the tribe she is from she will
either always tell the truth or always tell lies.
<p>
What are the minmum number of questions required to determine which 
path you should take?
