<h1>APPARATUS FOR FACILITATING THE BIRTH OF A CHILD BY
CENTRIGUGAL FORCE</h1>
GEORGE B. BLONSKY and CHAROLETTE E.  BLONSKY<p>
Patented November 9, 1965<p></center>
<br>
                                                               
 <p>The present invention relates to apparatus which utilizes
centrifugal force to facilitate the birth of a child at
less stress to the mother.

<p>It is known, that due to natural anatomical conditions,
the foetus needs the application of considerable propelling
force to enable it to push aside the constricting vaginal
walls, to overcome the friction of the uteral and vaginal
surfaces and to counteract the atmospheric pressure opposing
the emergence of the child. In the case of a
woman who has a fully developed muscular system and
has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy, 
as is common with all more primitive peoples,
nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to
have a normal and quick delivery. This is not the case,
however, with more civilized women who often do not
have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in
confinement.

<p>It is the primary purpose of the present invention to
provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped
woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly
directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison
with and supplements her own efforts.

<p>In accordance with the invention, there is provided
rotatable apparatus capable of subjecting the mother and
the foetus to a centrifugal force directed to assist and
supplement the efforts of the mother so that such centrifugal
force and her efforts act in concert to overcome the action
of resisting forces and facilitate the delivery of the child.
 
For a better understanding of such apparatus, as well
as the advantages and novel features thereof, reference
is made to the following description which should be read
in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which

and

<p><img src="http://paulbourke.net/fun/patent/patent5.gif" >
<br>FIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG. 4
showing another
embodiment of such means.

<p>Referring more particularly to FIGS. 1 to 3 of the
drawings, the numeral 10 indicates generally a concrete
floor slab of sufficient weight and strength to securely
support the apparatus of this invention in its operations.
Secured to the slab 10, as by anchor bolts 11, is the base
plate 12 of the apparatus. The base plate may be made
of heavy cast iron and has bolted thereto an anti-friction
bearing 13 for the main vertical shaft 14, a motor 15, a
controller 16, a speed reducer 17 and a hand brake 18.
The motor shown is a vari-speed vertical gear motor
which is controlled by the controller 16, and which is
arranged to drive the main vertical shall 14 at a closely
controlled variable speed of revolution, through a motor
sheave 19, the speed reducer 17 and a sheave 20 secured I
to such shaft.

<p>Bolted to the upper surface of sheave 20 are two short
channel irons 25, 25 arranged in spaced parallel relation
on opposite sides of the vertical shaft 14 and on which
are mounted in transverse relation the main I-beams
26, 26. The I-beams are likewise disposed on opposite 
sides of shaft 14 and are balanced on the channels 25, 26,
 in spaced, parallel relation. Welded on the I-beams 26,
 26 are a series of spaced, transverse, small deck channels
 27 on which is affixed a steel deck plate 28 of elongated
 rectangular form and through the center of which 
extends the axis of the shaft 14. Mounted on the deck plate
 28 is a removable stretcher frame generally designated 24
 and composed of a base plate 29 adapted to lie directly
 upon the deck plate 28, two transverse aluminium end
I-beams 30, 30 and two longitudinally extending 
aluminium side channels 31, 31 which are welded to the base
 plate 29 and to an aluminium stretcher deck 32 supported
 by such end beams and side channels. Attached to the
 outer and inner ends of the deck 32 arc handles 33 by
which the stretcher frame 24 may be manipulated when
 positioned on and removed from the apparatus.

 <p>The stretcher frame 24 extends from one end of deck
 28, past the shaft 14, and to a point beyond such shaft;
 the arrangement of the frame being such that the head
of the woman lying on such frame overlies the upper end
 of shaft 14 which is located in the region between the
 two channel irons 25, 25. Consequently, the head of a
 patient on the machine is positioned at or near the center
 of rotation of the deck 28. At its other end, the base
plate 29, of the stretcher frame is provided with a pair of
 spaced bayonet extensions 35 adapted to be passed
 through openings 36 in deck 28 and by then shifting the
 stretcher frame outwardly, to be brought into 
engagement with the outer edges of such opening which 
function in the nature of stops and contact with such extensions
 35 to prevent further outward movement of the frame
 during the operations of the apparatus. The outer edges
 of the openings 36 are re-enforced by a transverse butt
 plate 37 which is welded on the top front end of the deck
 28. Adjacent to the other or inner end of base plate 29,
 the deck 28 has suitably secured thereto two upstanding
 bolts 38 with which two holes in such base plate register
 when the extensions 35 are properly abutting the outer
 edges of the openings 36 and the associated edge of the
 butt plate 37. When the bolts 38 are projecting through
 such registered holes the bass plate 29 is secured to the
 deck 28 by wing nuts 39.

 <p>Between the bolts 38 and the other end of the deck
 28, such deck has welded thereto a plurality of transverse
 I-beams 45 for supporting a ballast deck 46, which beams
 and deck 46 are designed to partially counterbalance to a
 given extent the stretcher frame to be mounted on the
 remainder of deck 28. The ballast deck 46 has fixed
 thereto a number (about ten) of aluminium ballast water
 boxes or tanks 47, each having the capacity to hold 20
 pounds of water when the deck 28 is revolving. Each of
 the boxes 47 is provided with a filling funnel 48, a drain
 facet 49 and a sight glass 50 to enable filling it with an
 exact amount of water. The ballast water to be filled in
 the boxes 47 should exactly counterbalance the difference
 in the total weights on opposite sides of the axis of 
rotation of deck 28 due to the weight of the body of the
 woman on the stretcher, the weight of the stretcher and
 its associated equipment, the weight of the ballast deck
 46 and the ballast tanks 47, etc. in order to assure a
 smooth rotational movement of the machine.

<p>The stretcher frame 24 is provided with equipment
 for securing the prospective mother suitably for the 
operation and for assuring the safe delivery of the child.
 The woman's head is placed on a pillow 55 which is
 held in position on the stretcher deck 32 by a plurality
 of pillow clamps 56 so that her head may be located
 at or near to the center of rotation of the machine.
 Underlying the pelvis of the woman and mounted for
 longitudinal slidable movement on the deck 32 is a
 transverse plate 57 having guide members 58 in the form
of bolts in slidable engagement with guide slots 59 
extending longitudinally along the sides of deck 32. When
 the plate is located in the most appropriate position for
 the expectant mother, the wing nuts on the bolts forming
 the guide members 58 are tightened to secure the plate
 in such position. The plate 57 has welded thereto 
adjacent to each side of the woman's hips two upright slotted
 guide plates 60, 60 adapted to slidable support a girdle
 member 61 consisting of a cast aluminium half girdle or
 skirt covering only the lower abdomen and the sides of
 the hips and having a free open passage for the child to
 be born. The girdle member 61 is slidably connected to
 the four guide plates 60 by screws which are welded to
 the vertical sides of such member and project out through
 the slots in such plates, and wing nuts 62 which are
 tightened on such screws to bold the member 61 in an
 adjusted position on the guide plates 60.  When the
 girdle member 61 is properly adjusted relative to the
 perspective mother, it prevents movement of her abdomen
 radially above and over the pelvis, thus assuring that all
 movement of the foetus will be through the natural 
channel, which is the main central opening in the pelvic bone.
 The member 61 also funnels the centrifugal pressures of
 organs lying between the foetus and the head of the woman
 towards and against the foetus, thus augmenting the 
latter's tendency to be pressed out of the womb through
the pelvic opening and out of the mother's body.

<p>Positioned outwardly of the slide plate 57 and mounted
 on the stretcher deck 32 so as to be located beneath the
woman's thighs is a second sliding plate 65 provided with
 guide members in the form of wing bolts 66 which extend
 through longitudinally extending slots 67 in the deck 32
 to adjustably connect such sliding plate 65 to the deck.
 Fixedly mounted on the plate 65 in any suitable manner
 are a pair of thigh holder plates 68, 68. Inasmuch as
 the plates 68, 68 are the main agents for preventing the
 woman's body from being moved radially of the axis of
 rotation by the centrifugal force, they are of great 
importance and should be made particularly sturdy and be
 securely connected to plate 65. Also as the whole of
 the centrifugal force of the woman's body will be 
transmitted through the slide plate 65 to the stretcher deck
 32, it is advisable to use wing bolts 66 of strong 
construction and possibly more than two pairs of the same.
 
 <p>Located between the side edges of the sliding plate 65
 and the side edges of the stretcher deck 32 are a pair of
 elongated plates 70, 70 slidably connected for 
longitudinal adjustment on such deck 32 by the wing bolts 71 and
 slots 72 in the deck 32. Suitably secured to each plate
 70 is a boot member 73 for receiving and holding the
 woman's foot in proper relation to her position during
 the operation.

 <p>Also positioned on the side edge portions of the deck
 32 adjacent to the sides of plate 65, and located between
 the plates 70 and the ends of the transverse plate 37,
 are two plates 76, 76. The plates 76 are each slidably
 connected to the deck 32 for longitudinal adjustment
 thereon by wing bolts 77 and slots 78 in such deck.
 Each of the plates 76 is provided with a hand grip 79
 for the woman in the operation of the machine.

 <p>In addition to the aforesaid supports and grips, the
 apparatus is provided with several straps to assure the
 safe, steady and comfortable positioning of the woman
 on the stretcher. Thus, the head is held firm by a chin
 or neck strap 82 detachably connected at its ends to the
 stretcher deck 32. The body is steadied by a strap 83
 provided on the transverse plate 57, and the thighs are
 firmly held in the thigh plates 68 by straps 84 connected
 to the sides of such plates.

<p>Means are provided to assure the safe delivery of the
foetus and to stop the machine immediately upon such
delivery. These means comprise a pocket-shaped reception
net 88 made of strong, elastic material and supported 
under tension by tail ropes 89 secured at one end
by the tail hook 90 to the tail mast 91 fixed to the outer
end of plate 65, and secured at their other diverged ends
by the hooks 92 to the thigh holders 68. When properly
supported in this fashion, the net 88 is barely in contact
with the upright member 93 of the automatic switchout
hinged "L" lever. The horizontal part 94 of the hinged
"L" lever rests firmly on the switch out button 95, which
latter rests lightly, but firmly, on the spring switch 
contactor 96. The bottom or closed end of the net 83 is
lined with a thick wad of cotton 97. When the foetus
leaves the mother's vagina and lands on the cotton bed
97 in the net 88, its weight, as a result of the rotation
of the machine, exerts a radial centrifugal force on the
bottom of the elastic net 88. This force on the net 88
presses on the upright switch-out plate 93 causing the
depression of the horizontal switch-out plate 94 and the
switch-out button 95, which through a known 
conventional circuit arrangement (not shown) causes an electric
switch in the control box 16 to stop the drive motor 15
and the rotation of the whole machine.

<p>A suitable hand brake 18 is provided adjacent to the
controller 16 to enable the operator to stop quickly the
inertial rotation of the machine after the current is
switched off either by the new born child, or by the
operator on instruction from the gynecologist in charge
of the operation, or by suitable automatic means which
come into operation when the rate of revolution of the
machine, either through mistake or malfunction, exceeds
the amount considered safe for the particular patient
thereon. In the construction illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 3
of the drawings, such as automatic means is shown as
constituted of a steam engine centrifugal ball governor
105 mounted on a frame 106 over the center of rotation
of the machine. The frame 106 is mounted on angle
irons 107 welded to the bottom surfaces of the I-beams
26. The slide ring 108 of the governor 105 carries two
adjustable vertical switch-out prongs 109 which 
cooperate with a switch 110 positioned to control a circuit in
the control box 16 at a given rotational speed of the
governor. As the speed of rotation of the governor 
increases to such given speed, the governor balls 111 fly
outwardly and upwardly and lift the sliding ring 108,
which raises the prongs 109 and causes them to operate
the switch 110 to cause suitable means in the controller
16 to switch out the motor 15.

<p>For safety sake, the machine is enclosed in an annular
fence 115 capable of excluding all personnel from the
reach of the revolving deck 28. The fence 115 is equipped
with two gates 116 which can be opened before and after
spinning to facilitate safe access of personnel while 
installing or dismantling the stretcher 24 on the deck 28. The
gates are provided with hinge spurs 117 which will not
permit rotation of the deck 28 unless the gates 116 are
closed.

<p>It will he understood from the aforesaid description of
the embodiment of the apparatus illustrated in FIGS. 1 to
3 of the drawings, that the expectant mother is initially
installed on the stretcher 24 at a place remote from the
apparatus. The stretcher it readily removed from the
deck plate 28 by unscrewing the wing nuts 39, lifting the
head end of the stretcher up from the deck 28, and then
sliding the bayonet extensions 35 of the stretcher 
bottom plate 29 out of the holes 36 in the deck plate 28. The
dismantled stretcher is then placed on a carting table and
wheeled to the patient's bed. The patient is weighed and
measurements are taken to enable proper adjustment of
the girdle plate 57, the thigh plate 65, the foot plates 70,
70 and the handgrip plates 76, 76.  When such plates are
properly adjusted for the patient, they are fastened 
firmly and securely in place by lightening their associated wing
nuts. The patient is then placed in position on the 
stretcher 24 with her bead on the pillow so that it will be near
or at the center of rotation of the machine. The girdle 61
is then secured in position on the standards 60 and the 
inside surface of the girdle is packed firmly but not lightly
with cotton wool 62, The thighs of the woman are placed
inside the thigh holders 68, 68 and her feet are placed
inside the boot members 73, 73. In the placement of the
patient on the stretcher, the several plates on which the
girdle 61, thigh holders 68, 68, boot members 73, 73 and
hand grips 79, 79 are mounted, may be additionally 
adjusted so that the patient is comfortably, but properly and
firmly positioned on the stretcher. The straps 82, 83 and
84 are now put in place and tightened to restrict the 
movement of the head, torso and thighs, respectively. The
infant reception net 88 is then installed in position by 
attaching the hooks 90 and 92 to the tail post 91 and to
to the thigh holders 68, 68, respectively. The inside of
the net is provided with the wad of cotton 97 to protect
the child against too direct a contact with the upright
switchout plate 93. The patient is now ready to be
whetted from her bed or the preparation room to the delivery room.

<p>At the delivery room, the stretcher 24 is removed from
the carting vehicle and placed on the deck plate 28 of the
machine. In doing this, it is believed preferable to lift
the head end of the stretcher about two feet above the
foot end to enable the bayonet extensions 35 to be moved
more readily through the openings 36 in the deck plate
28 until such extensions are firmly butted against the
outer edges of such openings and the butting plate 37. In
the same movement, the bolts 38 are threaded through
the associated holes in the head end of stretcher plate 29
and such plate 29 is brought to rest in full contact with
the deck plate 28. The wing nuts 39 are then firmly
screwed onto the both 38 to solidly and immovably affix
the stretcher and the patient to the deck plate 28. While
the stretcher is being lowered to horizontal position on
the deck plate 28, the switch-out button 95 passes
through openings provided for it in the stretcher plates 29
and 32 and comes into position to be actuated by the
horizontal switch arm 94.

<p>When the patient has been properly installed in the
machine, the required counter ballast weight of water,
determined by the pre-operational weighing of the patient,
is loaded through the funnels 48 into the ballast tanks 47.
The gates 116 in the safety fence 115 are closed and
latched after the stretcher carting vehicle and all
personnel, except for the patient, leave the enclosure of the fence
116. The gynecologist in charge of the operation instructs
the operator as to the gravitational force to be applied
to the foetus and the latter takes his place at the controls
16 of the apparatus.

<p>When the gynecologist decides that the most opportune
tithe for childbirth has arrived, he instructs the operator
to start the machine. when the operator moves the 
controller handle 21 from zero position the motor 15 is started
and through the speed reducer 17 and the associated
set of sheaves and belts, including the sheaves 19 and 20,
the I-beam frame 26 and everything supported thereby
are revolved horizontally about the vertical axis of shaft
14. As the operator moves the controller handle 21 to
feed more and more current to the motor 15, the 
rotational speed of the machine progressively increases and
so does the centrifugal force. The relationship of speed
of rotation and of acceleration at three feet distance from
the center of rotation is illustrated by the following table:

</TABLE>

<p>Both the body of the mother and the foetus are subjected
to centrifugal forces which are functions of distance from
the center of rotation and the speed of rotation. The
body of the mother is firmly held in position against
movement as a whole under such forces by the boot 
members 73, 73, the thigh holders 68, 68, the girdle 61, the
hand grips 79, 79, and the belts 82, 83 and 84. However,
there are no external means present which will interfere
with the foetus tendency to respond to the action of the
centrifugal force. Only those forces which oppose 
normal childbirth i.e. the frictional and constrictional forces
within the mother, are to he overcome by the combined
action of the mother's muscles and the centrifugal force
created by the rotation of the foetus in the machine. The
physician's estimate of how much of this centrifugal force
will be needed to assist the mother in achieving the birth
of the child and the maximum g's that can he used with
safety on the particular patient, are derided upon before
the operation. During the operation, the operator 
gradually speeds up the machine to the predetermined force
which is expected to produce the birth of the child, and if
such force does not accomplish this, he does not exceed
it, unless the physician decides to go the higher g's. He
cannot, however, go beyond the maximum g's for which
the machine has been set without causing the governor
105 to shut down the machine. When in the operation
of the machine, the operator reaches a rate of rotation
at which the combination of pressures produced both by
the created centrifugal force and by the mother exceed
the childbirth resisting forces (friction and constriction),
the movement of the foetus occurs and the child it 
delivered into the net 88. While in the net, the child is still
subjected to the action of centrifugal force and is caused
by such force to firmly press against the elastic bottom of
the net 88. As the elastic cables 89 and the net give 
somewhat to this force which is equal to the weight of the
child multiplied by the number of g's it is subjected to,
the cotton wad 97 in the net it pressed by the child against
the switch lever 93 which it actuated to cut the power
from the motor 15 and may be utilized to activate an
electric bell, announcing the event. The operator then
applies the handbrake 18 to gently bring she machine
to a complete stop. Thereupon, the stretcher with the
mother on it is detached from the machine and 
transported to her room.

<p>As has been above indicated, the apparatus depicted
m FIGS. 1-3 of the drawings is shown by way of example
and it is within the contemplation of the invention to 
include other embodiments containing the essential features
thereof. Thus, instead of mounting the stretcher 
horizontally on the machine which is the preferred condition where
the number of g's employed in accomplishing the birth of
the child is relatively high (say above 8 g's), the machine
may be constructed as is indicated in FIG. 4, to take care
of births which may be brought about at much lower g's.
In this connection, and before entering into a description
of FIG. 4, it might be said that the centrifugal force 
carried by rotation of an object about a vertical axis has a
horizontal direction, but due to the always present 
gravitational force, the actual force exerted on such object is
a resultant of these two forces. The influence of the
gravitational force on the direction of action of the 
resultant force is greatest at the lower rotational speeds, and
its effect becomes progressively less and less important at
the higher g's so that the direction of the resultant 
progressively approaches the horizontal. Therefore, in order to
obtain the maximum effect of the resultant on the foetus,
especially at the lower rotational speeds, the mother should
be placed in such a position on the machine as to obtain
the nearest possible parallelism between the direction of
action of the resultant and the line connecting the center
of gravity of the foetus and the center point of the opening
of the pelvis through which the foetus has to travel on its
way out. To enable this to be accomplished at the lower
rotational speeds, at which the gravitational force is of
increasingly greater importance, it is necessary that the
 stretcher be given an inclination corresponding to the
 prediagnosed g's at which it is expected that delivery will
 take place. This may be accomplished by modifying the
 above described embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 3 of the 
drawings to the extent that the deck 28 of such embodiment is
 dispensed with, and instead supporting the stretcher 24
 directly on the I-beams 26 and two standards 120 as is
 shown in FIG. 4 of the drawings. In such construction,
 the I-beams 26 are provided with two lugs 121 to which
 the foot end of the stretcher is pivotally connected by
 means of a removable rod 122 that extends through 
openings provided in the side channels 31 of the stretcher. The
 standards 120 are securely welded to the I-beams 26 and
 are provided with a number of openings 123 through which
 a removable rod 124 may he inserted to support the
 stretcher at different inclinations dependent on the 
pre-determined rotational speeds selected for delivery, as is
 indicated by the dotted partial outlines of the stretcher
 in FIG. 4. Like the rod 122, the rod 124 extends through
 openings provided in the side channels 31 of the stretcher.
 The standards 120 also support the frame 106' for the
 governor 105.

  <p>As is shown in FIG. 5 of the drawings, it is also possible
 to have the stretcher automatically adjust its slope to the
 optimum direction at whatever rate of rotation it happens
 to be spinning at a given moment. This is achieved by
 hinging the stretcher at its head end on the standards 120'
 by means of a removable rod extending through openings
 provided in the side channels 31 of the stretcher and 
openings 125 provided in such standards 120' at a moderate
 height above the main I beams 26 of the machine, and
 letting the foot end of the stretcher rest freely on the outer
 ends of such I-beams. If, for example, the height of the
openings 125 in standards 120' is selected so that the angle
 of repose of the stretcher corresponds to the angle of 
inclination the stretcher would assume when subjected to a
 centrifugal acceleration of two g's, no elevation of the foot
 end of the stretcher will occur before the speed of 
rotation is high enough to cause a horizontal component of
 two g's. As soon as that minimum is exceeded, the foot
 end of the stretcher will leave the surfaces of the I-beams
 26 and rise higher and higher as the speed of rotation is
 increased, to provide the stretcher with a slope which 
corresponds to the resultant of the gravitational and acceleration
forces at any given speed of rotation of the machine.
 Thus as the physician slowly increases the g's to the value
 at which the travel of the foetus begins, the centrifugal and
 gravitational forces automatically adjust the inclination
 of the mother's body to the optimum position for efficient
application of the accelerating forces. This assures that
 the patient will be submitted to the very minimum 
acceleration which is necessary to produce the dislodgement
 of the foetus.  When the child has been delivered and the
 mother cut out in the manner described in the 
embodiment of FIGS. 1-3, the foot of the stretcher will return
 to a gentle landing on the I-beams 26 as the machine 
decelerates. It will he understood, that in all of the 
embodiments of the invention it is the primary purpose of
 the apparatus disclosed to accomplish delivery of the foetus
 by providing the necessary g`s required in any particular
 instance and this even though the supplementary forces
 supplied by the patient are zero either because she is too
 weak to render any assistance at all, or has lost consciousness.

<p>It will be understood that other changes and 
modifications may be made in the apparatus without departing
from the spirit of the invention, or the scope of the appended claims.

<p>What is claimed is: 

<p>1.  Child delivery apparatus comprising a centrifuge,
means for supporting said centrifuge for rotational 
movement about a vertical axis, means for holding the patient's

in such rotational movement, with her body disposed
radially of said vertical axis in proper attitude for delivery
of the child and with her head located at or near said 
vertical axis, said holding means including means for 
securing the patient's body in place on said centrifuge, means
for supporting the patient's limbs in child bearing position
against the centrifugal forces, and means for supporting
