<h1>Silly Statements from my Bank</h1>

<p align="justify">
After discharging my home loan quite some time ago and even closing
my home loan account, my bank finds it
appropriate to send statements as illustrated below. This is inspite
of two attempts to inform them that I no longer need them and they don't
actually convey any useful information. (Read the text and projections,
some are quite humorous). There are, at least, the following disturbing aspects
of this
</p>

<ul>
<li>Their systems and software are so "dumb" that they don't flag such
statements as unnecessary.
<p>
<li>The system doesn't have a "human" presence that would certainly pick
up something like this. 
<p>
<li>In this era of worrying about year 2000 bugs, if the bank can't get 
someting as simple as this worked out what luck will they have more more
complicated y2k issues.
</ul>
<b>Update</b><p>
Yes, another one arrived today, January 2002!
