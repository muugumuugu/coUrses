Given a sealed room, a solid brick (no holes, pores, contained
volumes, etc.), and an extremely accurate scale.  Place the brick
on the scale and note the reading.  Pump the air out of the room;
what happens to the reading on the scale?  (Assume the scale and 
the physical structure of the brick are not affected in any way 
by the vacuum.)
