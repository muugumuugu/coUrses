### RNN Parameters
* `maxlen` - length of a "sentence" for inputting into RNN.
* temperature (aka "diversity"): A number in the range of 0-1 (cannot be 0). The temperature is divides probabilities before applying softmax. Lower temperature will result in more "expected" outcomes (high probabilities are even higher). A higher temperature increases the "diversity" of outcomes, but may produce less "correct-sounding" results.

### RNN architectures
* one to one (ANN)
* one to many (captioning)
* many to one (sentiment analysis)
* many to many (text, music generation, language translation)

### Python
* [Environment Setup](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/wiki/Python-Environment-for-LSTM-example)
* `open()` and `read()` for reading in a text file: [python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html)
* [dictionaries in python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-dictionaries) for looking up characters by index, and index by characters.
* `enumerate()`: [docs](https://docs.python.org/2.3/whatsnew/section-enumerate.html) for iterating over all characters.
