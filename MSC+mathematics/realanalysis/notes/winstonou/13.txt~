Boundedness of a Function
Continuity preserves Compactness.
	again with them pullbacks and pushforwards.
Continous function from compact space to Euclidean Space is bounded.
Extreme Value Theorem
	f : X → ℝ
	f cts, X compact
	⇒ existance of max and min
	ie ∃ p,q ∈ X st f(p)=sup(f(X)) and f(q)=inf(f(X))
	pf:
		set M:=sup(f(X)), m:=inf(f(X))
		Mis in the closure of f(X) and so is m.
		But compactness of X ,and continuity of f guarantees that f(X) is compact.
		and by heine-borel, it is also closed. making M, m to belong to f(X).
Bijectivity on compact sets preserves Continuity(inverse is also continous)
	proof by making using complements of sets.
Uniform Continuity
	for all epsilons, there is a particular same delta tightness so as to achive the epsilon tolerance around any point.
	continuity delta depends on point in question too, but uniform continuity is defined for the set as a whole.
Continous functions from compact sets are Uniformly Continous.
