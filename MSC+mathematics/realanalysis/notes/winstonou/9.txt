Closure of a set
	: Ē=E∪E'.
	Closure is a closed set.
	Set is closed iff = Ē
Relative Openness
	: like a slice of an open set.
	fatten up to get an open set in the super set, then intersect with the ambient subset, thats the basis of open sets relative to the ambient subset.
Compact Sets
	: like finitness for infinite sets
	Any Open cover of the set has a finite subcover.
