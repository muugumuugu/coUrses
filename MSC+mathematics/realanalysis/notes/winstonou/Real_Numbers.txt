==== the sqrt 2 proof ====

=== claim ===
let A = {p ∈ ℚ | p>0, p^{2} < 2}
given any p ∈ A,
constuct q = p -  (p^{2}-2)/(p+2): from the secant of the graph
	now q>p 
claim q^{2} < 2 .
	q^{2} - 2 = 2 (p^{2} - 2)/(p + 2)^{2} < 0

===== what is ℝ =====
A minimal ordered field containing ℚ and satisfying the lowest upper bound property
constructed using //Dedikin Cuts// 

===== glb and ulb =====
an ordered set has the lub property if and only if it has the glb property. 

===== Field??? =====
set with two binary operations denoted by + and * such that:
1. set is closed under both + & *
2. both + & * satisfy commutatative and assosiative laws
3. + distributes over *
4. ∃ both multiplicative and additive identities.
5. inverses exist, except the multiplactive inverse for the additive identity.
examples ℚ,ℝ,ℂ
all arithmetic laws are derived from these axiomatic properties.

===== order relation =====
antireflexive,
transitive,
exactly one of the two holds aRb or bRa, when a!=b.
