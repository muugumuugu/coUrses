====== Continuity(Ch4) ======
Limit
	no matter how close you need to be to L, there is a tight enough punctured ngbhd around the accumalation pt(not necessarily in the domain) in the domain that maps the values to within the given tolerance of L.
	this tightness/closeness is wrt to the metrics of the domain and range metric spaces respectively.

Limit if present for some pt in the domain , is unique.
	else it would have to map to two different non intersecting(make them small enough) nghbds around the distinct lt points.
Continuity
	continuity requires that even at the point in question, which belongs to the domain, the output has to lie within the tolerance nghbhd, meaning f(p)=L.
	coz f(p) ∈ Nₑ(L) ∀ e>0
	if in addition, p is a lt point, then f cts at p iff lt(f(x))=f(p) as x tends to p
Compositions and Continuity
	if f is continous at p and g is contnous at f(p) then the composition is continous at p
Alternate characterization of continuity
	metric-free definition
	f : X → Y is continous on X iff the pre-image of any open set in Y is open in X.
	pf by pullbacks and pushes
	pick any p in f⁻¹(V), V being a open set in Y.\
	map it to f(p) , which is interior to V and hence has a small nghbd that lies inside V,
	By continuity there is a nghbd around p in X that maps to this chosen nghbd in V.
	hence the nghbd extracted in X lies in f⁻¹(V), and so p is interior to f⁻¹(V), proving that it is open.
