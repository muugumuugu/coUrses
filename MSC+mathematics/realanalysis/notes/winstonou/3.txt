Fields
	Generalization of ‚Ñö, ‚Ñù, ‚ÑÇ etc.
	Has More than one element
	Has Binary operations + and * , analogous to addition and multiplication in ‚Ñù
		These satisfy closure, assosivity, and distributivity analogously
		There exist additive inverses for all and multiplicative inverses for all but the aditive identity(0).
Ordered Fields
	ùîΩ is a ordered field if there is a order on F such that addition of same element preserves the order,
	and multiplication preserves positivity.
	‚ÑÇ is not an ordered Field.
‚Ñù is the minimal? ordered field containing ‚Ñö  and satisfying the LUB property.
