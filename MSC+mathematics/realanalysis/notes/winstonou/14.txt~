Connectedness
	set that cannot be expressed as union of non empty sets A & B whose intersectons with the other's closure is empty, i.e,  seperated sets.
E in ℝ is connected if for any x,y ∈ E the entire open interval(x,y) is also in E
Continious image of connected set is connected.
	pf by contraposition
	Corollary : IVT
		f : [a,b] → ℝ, continous
		for any γ between f(a) and f(b),
		there is a c between a & b so that f(c)=γ.
Discontinuities in ℝⁿ
	Right/Left handed Limits.
	Simple Discontinuities
		both Left and Right handed limits exist(maybe different)
	Monotonic Functions.
		Always have RHLs and LHLs.
			sup((a,x))=LHL(x)
		for x<y RHL(x)≤LHL(y)
		Set of discontinuities is countble.
