====== metrics ======

* define d so that it is a non-negative symetric function in which triangle inequality holds and d(x,x)=0;
		* d = distance function.
* cauchy Schwarz
		* |x.y|<|x||y|

====== topology ======
* define topologies, as in, boundary of a set, open sets etc wrt chisen metric(space and distance)

====== closure of a set. ======
Ē=E ∪ E' ; E'=set of all of E's limit points: derieved sets

====== Open Balls ======
Every open ball in M,d is open in Metric Space M,d

====== open cover ======
collection of open sets that cover the set in question, i.e. their union contains the set.

====== compact set ======
if every subcover of a set E in a metric space M,d has a finite subcover.

====== Heine-Borel Spaces/Property ======
* holds for ℝ
* a set is compact iff it is closed and bounded.
