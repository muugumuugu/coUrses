Abel'Theorem s
	cauchy product of convergent sequences if convergent,
	converges to the product of the limits of the series.
====== Sequences and Series of Functions (ch7) ======
Point-Wise
	on a subset E of a metric space X, define
	{fₙ : E → ℂ}
	if ∀ x ∈ E, lim fₙ(x) exists, say = f(x)
	tolerance index depends on both tolerance epsilon, and computing pt x.
	then this is called the point-wise limit.
	non - example: Blimp function
	Doesnot preserve continuity.
Charecteristic/Indicator function of a Set E.
	Chi(y)=1 if y ∈ E, 0 otherwise
* Point-wise Limits and Differentiation do not commute
* Point-wise Limits and Integration do not commute.
Uniform Convergence
	∃ N st |fₙ(x)-f(x)|<∊ ∀ x ∀n>N
	index depends only on tolerance, and is the same for all computation pts.
	the function constrain tube.
Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence
	{fₙ} converges uniformly on E iff
	the functions lie within a tolerance of each other post some finite index
		triangle inequality on limit propert gives cauchy property
