Compactness is not Relative.
	open cover can be fattened, suncover found for fattened cover, then intersected.
Compactness implies closedness
	because finite subcover of lesser than 1/2 d ngbhds create a contained ball around any point in the complement, so that it is open.
Closed Subsets of Compact Sets are Compact.
Finite Intersection Property:
	Intersection of every finite subcollection is Non-Empty.
For compact sets, fip imples infinte intersection also being non empty.
