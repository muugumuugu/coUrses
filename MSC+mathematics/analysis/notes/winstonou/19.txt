Subsequences
	If a sequence converges, every subsequence of it is convergent
Compactness and Subsequences
	A sequence on a compact space necessarily has a convergent subsequence.
	Case Finite Range:
		choose the output that is repeted infinite times(there has to be at least one) as the subsequence.
	Case Infinite Range:
		compactness of the superset guarantees that E has a limit point, say p.
		Construct pᵢ by choosing (choose the one with a greater index val each time) of the points for which d(p,pᵢ)<1/i.
		Can be done as all Neighbourhoods around p have infinitely many points.
	Bolzano Weirstras: Any bounded sequence in ℝⁿ has a convergent subsequence.
Cauchy Sequences
	if there is a index post which any two outputs are within a given tolerance of each other.
Diameter:
	E ⊂ X, S = {d(p,q): ∀  p,q ∈ E} ⊂ ℝ
	diam=sup(S)
Tail of a Sequence
	Eₙ={pₙ,pₙ₊₁...}
Diameter of Tails of Cauchy Sequences tends to Zero.
Diameter of Set = Diameter of Closure of Set
	Diam(Closure)≥Diam(Set) , obviously, closure just has additional points to consider.
	now also Diam(Closure)≤Diam(Set)
	because for any 2pts in Ē , p and q are either limit points or points of E.
	so that there are points p' and q' in E being arbitrarily close to p and q.
	this means dist(p,q)≤dist(p',q') because of triangle inequality
	hence diameter of the closure is constrained by diameter of the set
For a diameter vanishing, nested sequence of compact sets
	intersection = 1 point , else diameter wouldnt go to 0.
Complete metric space
	if every cauchy sequence is convergent in X, it is complete.
Any compact metric space is a complete metric space.
	consider a cauchy sequence, and its tail sets:Eᵢ
	consider closures of the tails, which will then be compact.
	now the infinite intersection of the closures would consist of exactly one point say p
	this p is the converging limit of X.
