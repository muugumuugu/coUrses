Limit point Compact
	: every infinite subset has a limit point in the set.
Compact implies Limit point Compact.
	Pf by contradiction
	create ngbhds that contain at most one pt of E
	make subcover.
	imply E is finite =><=
Intersection of closed intervals that form a sequence of nested intervals in ℝ is non empty.
	analogous(actually same as) to fip of compact => infinite intersection (Cantors intersection theorem?)
	Notate Iₙ as := [aₙ,bₙ]
	Since they are nested, aₘ≤aₘ₊₁≤bₘ₊₁≤bₘ
	consider set of all left end pts. E ={aᵢ}
	E is bounded above by any of the bᵢ
	By Completeness of ℝ E has a supremum, say x
	now x ∈ ∩Iₙ.
	done.
All k-Cells are compact.
	I:=k-Cell=Π[aᵢ,bᵢ]
	let δ=∑(bᵢ-aᵢ)² : length of diagonal = diameter of the cell
	now if x,y ∈ I, ||x-y||<δ
	pf by contradiction
	suppose thee is some bad cover of I.
	divide I diadically(into halfes) into 2ᵏ sub cells.
	now at least one of the resulting cells cannot be covered by a finite sobe cover of this bad cover chosen, else we are done and I is Compact.
	Call this uncoverable subcell I₁ and iterate diadically dividing and choosing uncoverables.
	Obtained:= nested subcells out of which non are coverable by finite subcovers of chosen cover, but diameters are shrinking
		diameter(Iₙ)=2⁻nδ
	Intersection of the Iₙ is nonempty(cantor intersection th), so it has some point say x*
	Now og cover covers entire I, so one of the Gᵢ:=Gₐ covers x* ,  so x* is interior to Gₐ (coz its an open set!)
	so there is some r so that the ngbd(x*,r) lies inside Gₐ.
	but we can choose large enough n so that 2⁻ⁿδ is smaller than r.
	Then Iₙ is contained within that nghbd, which is inside Gₐ. fuck, got covered by just one Gₐ when it couldnt be covered by finite Gᵢs =><=
Heine Borel Theorem
	In ℝⁿ the following are equivalent for any subset E:
		a. E is closed and bounded
			bounded: lies in a kcell , which is compact
			is closed subset of compact set: is compact.
			done
		b. E is compact
		c. E is limit pt compact
			prove c ⇒ a
			pf by contradiction
			bounded , else we can construct an infinite subset that has no limit point.
			closed else we can keep constructing balls around the limit point not in the set, and from their intersections with E, get an infinite subset of E that has the point in question as the limit point. but that point is outside E, contradicting lt pt compactness.
