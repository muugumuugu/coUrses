Uniform Boundedness and pointwise convergence on a compact set
	also do not guarantee uniform continuity
Equicontinuity
	𝔉 := collection of functions from some set E to ℂ.
	if for all ∊>0, ∃  a δ>0 st for all d(x,y)<δ then
		|f(x)-f(y)|< ∊ for every f in 𝔉
	then 𝔉 is equicontinous on E.
	Any finite family of uniformly continous functions is equicontinous
		just choose min of all the deltas.
UC and Equicontinuity.
	{fₙ} of uniformly converging,
	continous functions on a compact metric space.
	are equicontinous.
	pf:
		fix an epsilon,
		now from uniform continuity:
			|fₙ(x)-fₘ(x)| can be controlled to ∊/3 post some index M.
		now being on a compact set, each of the {fₙ} is uniformly continous
