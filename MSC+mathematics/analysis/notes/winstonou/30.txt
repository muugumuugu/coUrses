Uniform Boundedness and pointwise convergence on a compact set
	also do not guarantee uniform continuity
Equicontinuity
	𝔉 := collection of functions from some set E to ℂ.
	if for all ∊>0, ∃  a δ>0 st for all d(x,y)<δ then
		|f(x)-f(y)|< ∊ for every f in 𝔉
	then 𝔉 is equicontinous on E.
	Any finite family of uniformly continous functions is equicontinous
		just choose min of all the deltas.
UC and Equicontinuity.
	{fₙ} of uniformly converging,
	continous functions on a compact metric space.
	are equicontinous.
	pf:
		fix an epsilon,
		now from uniform continuity:
			|fₙ(x)-fₘ(x)| can be controlled to ∊/3 post some index m.
		now being on a compact set, each of the {fₙ} is uniformly continous
	f₁....fₘ are finite and continous on a closed set ⇒ equicontinous
		so for i ≤ m, ∃ δ st if d(x,y)<δ
		|fᵢ(x)-fᵢ(y)| < ∊/3
	now applying triangle inequality for control equation of fᵢ for i > m, we get
	|fᵢ(x)-fᵢ(y)| ≤ |fᵢ(x)-fₘ(x)+fₘ(x)-fₘ(y)+fₘ(y) -fᵢ(y)|
		split: ≤
		|fᵢ(x)-fₘ(x)|+|fₘ(x)-fₘ(y)|+|fₘ(y)-fᵢ(y)| < ∊ by continuity and uniform covergence

Ascoli Arzela Theorem
	for a pointwise bounded and equicontinous {fₙ} of complex valued function on a compact space K.
	{fₙ} turns out to be uniformly bounded on K with a uniformly convergent subsequence.
	Pf: from equicontinuity, we have a delta for which
		|fₙ(x)-fₙ(y)|< ∊ ∀ n when d(x,y)<δ
		so cover each point of K with delta balls; make a finit subcover, and so
		by ptwise boundedness find the Maximum of the bounds of the chosen finite number of points
		since functions in delta balls dont vary much
		the functions are bounded by Maximum so found + ∊
		uniform boundedness achieved :)
