UC and differentiation
	If we have {fₙ  [a,b] → ℂ} , all differentiable,
	and their derievatives converge uniformly on [a,b]
	and there is at least one point where the sequence itself converges,
	then the series itself converges uniformly on [a,b] to say,f
	and that function f is differentiable, with f'(x)=lim{fₙ'(x)}
	pf:
		using limit definition of derievative, and the mean value theorem
		apply UC everywhere to get tolerance bounds etc.

Weirstrass continuous nowhere differentiable function
	looks like koch fractal spiky.
	construction:
		1. f(x)=|x| ; -1<x<1, truncated.
		2. extend it to a periodic function of period 2.
			zig-zag line g(x+2)=g(X)
		3. take |g(s)-g(t)| ≤ |s-t|
			lipshitz continuity condition satisfied.
			uniformly continous
		4. define F(x) = ∑ (3/4)ⁿg(4ⁿx)
			converges uniformly by Weirstrass M Test
		5. F is no where differentiable.
			pf:
				pick any x ∈ ℝ
				For each m ∈ ℕ,
				define: δₘ:=±(1/2)4⁻ᵐ
				sign chosen so that no integer lies bw 4ᵐ & 4ᵐ(x+δₘ)
				consider |f(x+δₘ) - f(x)|/|δₘ| ≥ 1/2 (3ᵐ+1)
