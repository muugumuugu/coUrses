continuity is preserved in uniform convergence
	pf using triangle inequality, and then controlling whatever can be trapped between tubes.
Alternative perspective of UC.
	Continous Function Space = set of bounded cts functions on a metric space X
	Norm of f in  ℭ = sup({f(x) : x ∈ X})
	This defines a metric space.
	In this space fₙ → f means
		lim || fₙ-f || = 0
	i.e, sup(|fₙ(x)-f(x)|) < ∊ post some finite n,
	i.e |fₙ(x)-f(x)| < ∊ ∀ x ∈ X
	i.e, uniform convergence.
ℭ is a complete metric space
	need to show that every cauchy sequence converges in ℭ
	{fₙ} Cauchy ⇒ ||fₙ-fₘ|| <∊ post some finite index.
	so by cauchy criterion, it does converge, but does the limit belong to ℭ
	since fₙs are continous and bounded, so f is cotinous and bounded and so f ∈ ℭ.

====== Intro to Riemann Integration ======
Given an interval [a,b] in ℝ , and a bounded function f on it,
	Define Partition P=a=x₁<x₂<......xₙ=b
	M:=sup (f(x)) x ∈ [xᵢ,xᵢ₊₁]:= max value attained in chosen partition
	Δxᵢ=xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁
	Right hand Sum/ Upper Sum= ∑MᵢΔxᵢ,
	similarly define lower sum using inf.
	Now Upper RI= inf(UpperSums) over all Partitions.
	function is called to be RIable if upper RI= lower RI
if func has finite number of discontinuities, it is Riemann Integrable.
Properties of RI
	m(b-a)≤L(P,f)≤U<(P,f)≤M(b-a)
	If P ⊂ P*, P* is a refinement of P - more detailed.
		common refinement= P₁∪P₂.
		L(P*,f) ≥ L(P,f)
