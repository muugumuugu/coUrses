L'Hospital's Rule
	from GenMVT, and also g'(c) not being zero
		[f(b)-f(a)]/[g(b)-g(a)]=f'(c)/g'(c)
	also limits f'(a)=0, g'(a)=0
	let b also go to a,
	so that c which is trapped between a and b also goes to a
Taylor's Theorem
	for a function f: [a,b] → ℝ ,
	define Taylor's Polynomial
		P(t):= ⁿ⁻¹∑[f⁽ᵏ⁾(α) x (t-α)ᵏ / k!]
	Thm: f(β)=P(β) + f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) x (β-α)ⁿ / n!
	Error Control= M:= [f(β)-P(β)]/(β-α)ⁿ  =  f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) / n!
	we want to show that n!M - f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) =0  for some x bw α and β
	define g so that nth derivative = n!M - f⁽ⁿ⁾(x), then claim it has a extrema in interior of α and β
	g(t):= f(t)-P(t)-M(t-α)ⁿ
	g⁽ⁿ⁾=f⁽ⁿ⁾(t)-n!M, coz P is n-1 degreed.
	now the goal is to find an x bw α and β so that
	g⁽ⁿ⁾(x)=0
	from taylor polynomials, f⁽ᵏ⁾(α)=P⁽ᵏ⁾(α)
	so observe that g(α) = 0 and so is g'(α), and actually g⁽ᵏ⁾=0 for k=1,2,3,...,n-1
	now by constuction g(β)=0 , so by Rolle's Theorem. there is an x₁ bw α and β where g⁽¹⁾(x₁)=0=g'(α) and so iterating Rolle's on g⁽ⁱ⁾(xᵢ)=g⁽ⁱ⁾(α)=0
	we get g⁽ⁿ⁾=0 for some x between α and xₙ₋₁, which by nesting lies between α and β.
Sequences and Series(ch3)
	Convergence depends on Metric Space, and the metric.
		1. limit must lie in the space
		2. ngbhd distance depends on the metric.
	{pₙ} is a seq in X,d
	then if pₙ converges to p in X, ∀ r > 0
	Nᵣ(p) contains almost all of the {pₙ},
	ie all but some finite number of terms are arbitrarily close to the limit point.
