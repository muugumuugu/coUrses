Comparison Test
	if all terms of a sequence are smaller than a convergent series sequence,
	then the smaller series has to converge
Lacuanary/Cauchy test
	for a non-negetive non-increasing sequence
	series converges if this specific scaled subsequential series converges
	∑2ᵏbₖ : b = terms of the subsequence with indices = 2ᵏ
	consider the partial sum sequence of aᵢ =sₙ and partial cauchy sums=tₖ
	for any pair n,k ∋ n < 2ᵏ, sₙ < tₖ,
		because of the non-increasing nature of the sequence,
		grouping a₂, a₃ with 2a₂, a₄,a₅,a₆,a₇ with 4a₄ and so on...
	now if sₙ is ubounded, tₖ is unbounded.
	so if tₖ is bounded, sₙ is bounded, and so by monotonicity
	is convergent.
	Conversly if n>2ᵏ then sₙ>1/2tₖ
	so unboundedness of tₖ implies unboundedness of sₙ.
	so the convergences are equivalent.
Geometric Series
	∑xⁿ=1/(1-x) ∀ |x|<1
	sₙ=(1-xⁿ)/(1-x)
p-Series
	∑1/nᵖ converges iff p>1
	if p<0, sequence obviously diverges
	using cauchy test, convergence depends on convergence of:
	∑2ᵏx1/2ᵏᵖ = ∑2ᵏ⁽¹⁻ᵖ⁾ = geometric sequence
	so the sequence converges iff 2⁽¹⁻ᵖ⁾<1 , i.e 1-p< 0 or, p>1
Interesting Example
	∑ 1/ (n(log(n)ᵖ) converges iff p>1
	Using Lacuanary again
		depends on covergence of
		∑2ᵏ/[2ᵏ(log2ᵏ)ᵖ] = ∑1/(klog2)ᵖ =1/(log2)ᵖ x ∑1/(k)ᵖ → p-series
Root Test
	α:= lim-sup(ⁿ√|aₙ|)
		α<1 → convergent
			idea:
			α=ⁿ√|aₙ| after some finite index
			so, αⁿ=|aₙ|
			if α<1 , ∑aₙ=∑αⁿ →subsequence of p-series.
		α=1 → in-determinate
		α>1 → divergent
