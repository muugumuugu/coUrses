being differentiable
	function=tangent + some error that goes to zero as varying gets closer to point
	f(t)=f(x)+f'(x)(t-x) +u(t)(t-x)
	u(t)→0 as t→x
Monotonicity from sign of derievatives.
Continuity of the derievative
	Not necessary
	But derievatives do possess the Intermediate Value property
	pf: use fermat's theorem on g=f(t)-k(t), k being the required value of the derievative.
	minima of g cannot occur at end points because of the derieavatives at the end points being decreasing on the lower side and increasing on the higher side.
	so minima occurs in (a,b), and there the derievative is 0.
	Corollary: f' cannot have simple discontinuities.(i.e. no jumps)
