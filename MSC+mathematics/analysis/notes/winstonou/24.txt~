Series of the form ∑aₙbₙ
	nth tail partial sum = ᵐ∑ₖ₌ₙ aₖbₖ
	=ᵐ⁻¹∑ₖ₌ₙ  (Aₖ(bₙ-bₙ₊₁)) + Aₘbₘ - Aₙ₋₁bₙ.
If partial sums of {aₙ} are bounded, and {bₙ} are non-increasing and convergent to 0
	then ∑aₙbₙ converges.
	cauchy criteris, triangle inequality, bound from A and epsilon from limit of b.
Leibinitz Thm
	Alternating sign series of sequence with decreasing magnitudes tending to zero coverged
For a power series of R=1, if coefficients are decreasing to 0, then the series converges on the unit disk, along with boundary excluding z=1.
Series Arithmetic
	Cauchy product
		Infinite product of one series into another.
		partition sum as series of the sequence cₖ=ᵏ∑₀ aₖbᵢ₋ₖᵢ
	Mertan's Theorem
		if one of the series in the cauchy product converges absolutely,
		then the product in the limit is the product of the limits.
