Mₙ:=sup |fₙ -f(x)| over x ∈ E
	fₙ uniformly converged on E iff Mₙ converges to 0.
Weirstrass-M Test
	If each of the functions is bounded ∀ x
	and ∑boundₙ converges,then
	∑fₙ converges
	Proof:
		by cauchy criteria, only need to show:
		|ᵐ∑ₙfₖ(x)|<∊
		use triangle inequality and replace with bounds,
		then use cauchy property of bounds.
Uniform Convergence's compatibility with Calculus.
	commutes with care
	lim(f(t)) as t→x = lim (lim(fₙ(t)) as t→x) as n→ ∞
	for any limit point of the set on which the sequence of functions is defined.
	Pf using triangle inequality and uniform convergence property
	lim(fₙ(t)) converge due to UC.
	triangle inequality makes lhs converge to the same limit.
	If the fₙ are continous, f is also continous.
	unlike pointwise convergence
A sequence of continous functions that shrink on a compact set, then they converge uniformly.
	fₙ(x)≥fₙ₊₁ ∀x , defined on K.
	suffices to show that fₙ(x)-f(x)<∊, because all functions indexed post n are anyway smaller than fₙ(x)
	choose Kₙ= set of points in K such that this difference > ∊ :
		try to show this becomes empty eventually
	functions are decreasing so that Kₙ⊂Kₙ₊₁, i.e they are nested (coz functions are decreasing)
	also the Kₙ are closed, because they are pre-images of a closed set [∊,∞) thru the continous function gₙ(x)=fₙ(x)-f(x)
	so Kₙ are compact also
	also their infinite intersection is empty.
	so one of the sets is empty, else they would satisfy fip and have a nonempty intersection.
