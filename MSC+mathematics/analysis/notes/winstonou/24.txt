Series of the form ∑aₙbₙ
	nth tail partial sum = ᵐ∑ₖ₌ₙ aₖbₖ
	=ᵐ⁻¹∑ₖ₌ₙ  (Aₖ(bₙ-bₙ₊₁)) + Aₘbₘ - Aₙ₋₁bₙ.
If partial sums of {aₙ} are bounded, and {bₙ} are non-increasing and convergent to 0
	then ∑aₙbₙ converges.
	cauchy criteris, triangle inequality, bound from A and epsilon from limit of b.
Leibinitz Thm
	Alternating sign series of sequence with decreasing magnitudes tending to zero coverged
For a power series of R=1, if coefficients are decreasing to 0, then the series converges on the unit disk, along with boundary excluding z=1.
Series Arithmetic
	Cauchy product
		Infinite product of one series into another.
		partition sum as series of the sequence cₖ=ⁿ∑₀aᵢbₖ-ᵢ
			sum along diagonals
	Mertan's Theorem
		if one of the series in the cauchy product converges absolutely,
		then the product in the limit is the product of the limits.
		∑cₖ converges to AB.

			Define
				β:=Bₙ-B
				γ:=∑aᵢβₙ₋ᵢ
			Now Cₙ= AₙB - γₙ, because:
				cₙ = ⁿ∑₀aᵢbᵢ₋ₙ = ⁿ∑₀aᵢ(B+βₙ₋ᵢ) = AₙB + γₙ
			now if we can show that γₙ→0, it's done.
				fix ∊>0
				now we have α:=|aₖ| , definable because of absolute convergence of {aₖ}
				and also βₙ→0
				so ∃ N ∋ |βₙ|< ∊/α ∀ n ≥ N
				now γₙ = ᴺ∑₀aᵢβₙ₋ᵢ +  ₙ∑ᴺ⁺¹aᵢβₙ₋ᵢ
				in the first half we habve βₙ  < ∊/α but second part is uncontrolled
				using triangle inequality:
				|γₙ| ≤ ∊/α (|aₒ|+|a₁|+...)  + ₙ∑ᴺ⁺¹aᵢβₙ₋ᵢ  < (∊/α)*α + ₙ∑ᴺ⁺¹aᵢβₙ₋ᵢ
				now the betas are constant and the tail of {aₖ} converge to 0
				so in the limit, γ < ∊ ∀ ∊>0. which gives
				γₙ → 0.
