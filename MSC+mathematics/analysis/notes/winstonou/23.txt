Absolute convergence
	from comparison test,
	∑aₙ coverges ⇒ ∑|aₙ| converges
Ratio Test
	β = limsup(|aₙ₊₁/aₙ|)
	β<1 → convergent
		idea:
			|aₙ₊₁/aₙ|=β<1
			|aₙ₊₁|=β|aₙ|
			basically a geometric sequence, with r<1.
	|aₙ₊₁/aₙ| ≥1 → divergent
Power Series
	Series of the form ∑cₙzⁿ
		cᵢ ∈ℂ , z is a complex variable
	example:
		eᶻ=∑1/k! x zⁿ
	Radius of convergence
		set α:=limsup ⁿ√|cₙ|
		R:={1/α if α>0 , ∞ if α =0}
		∑cₙzⁿ converges in the disk |z|<R and diverges where |z|>R
		at the boundary of the disk the behaviour is unknown.
			why?
			apply root test :)
