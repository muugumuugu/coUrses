Ascoli Arzela Theorem
	Like A sequential Compactness theorem
	existence of uc subsequence
	K is compact ⇒ ∃  countable dense subset E of K
	by countability and boundedness there is a subsequence of {fₙ} on E
		that is point-wise convergent
	This sequence is also uc.
		Pf:
		from equicontinuity, we have a delta for which
		|fₙ(x)-fₙ(y)|< ∊ ∀ n when d(x,y)<δ
		now cover each pt of E with delta nghbhds.
		By density, this also covers K.
		extract a finite subcover
			Now fₙ is pointwise onvergent on E,
			and so is it on the eᵢ that form the finite cover.
			let ptwise epsilon limit bounding tolerance indices = Nᵢ
			take the max = N.
			so that for the subsequence gᵢ
				|gₖ(eᵢ)-gₗ(eᵢ)| < ∊
			 	for all k,l ≥ N
				now apply triangle inequality on
					|gₖ(x)-gₗ(x)|  to get it contollable by 3∊.
					≤ |gₖ(x)-gₖ(eᵢ)| + |gₖ(eᵢ)-gₗ(eᵢ)| + |gₗ(x)-gₗ(eᵢ)|
					chosing eᵢ to be the specific e whose delta nghbd contains x.
					so that all parts are controllable to a degree of ∊
Stone-Weirstrass Theorem
	Like a Density Theorem
	Given any f in ℭ
	∃ sequence of polynomials {Pₙ} ∋ they converge uniformly to f on [a,b]
	Pf:
		Convergence wrt sup-norm metric ↔ uniform convergence
		so this theorem is equivalent to saying that the polynomials are dense in ℭ wrt sup norm metric.
	wlog we're on [0,1]
	and wlog f(0)=f(1)=0.
	assume f(x)=0 outside [0,1]
		so that f is uniformly continous on ℝ
	use the **Method of approximation of the identity**
		**Good Kernels**
	Let Qₙ(x):=cₙ(1-x²)ⁿ on [-1,1]
		keeps becoming a steeper bell
	take cₙ:= inverse of area underneath the natural curve to get integral Qₙ = 1
		cₙ:=(∫(1-x²)ⁿ)⁻¹
	observe: for any δ∈(0,1)
		Qₙ converges uniformly to 0 in δ≤|x|≤1, that is the height of the fringes of the bell vanish.
		becoz
			cₙ < √n
			On complement of nghbd, ie {δ≤|x|≤1} we have
				1-x² ≤ 1-δ²
			So Qₙ(x) ≤ √n(1-δ²)ⁿ
				converges uniform to 0 by l'Hospital's rule
	In some sense it is converging to the Dirac Delta function
		which is the identity function in the world of convolution.
		consider now Pₙ=₋₁∫¹f(x+t)Qₙ(t)dt
			the Qₙ sort of select values only where t is close to 0.
			sort of convolutes to f(x)
