Notions of boundedness for Sequences of functions
	1. If ∀ x , {fₙ(x)} is a bounded sequence,
	point-wise bounded.
		∃  ϕ(x) : the bound at x, st |f(x)|< |ϕ(x)|
	2. Uniform Boundedness
		∃ M st |fₙ(x)|< M ∀ n,x.
When can we get a pontwise convergent subsequence?
	bolzano weirstrass analogue
	uniform boundedness not enough
	Counter example:
		fₙ(x)=sin(nx) on [0,2π]
		suppose ∃ a ptwise convergent subseq.
		⇒  lim (sin(nᵢx)-sin(nⱼx))=-
		this says by Lebegues dominated Convergence Thm that
			lim ₀∫²ᵖⁱ (sin(nᵢx)-sin(nⱼx)²dx=0
			but this limit is 2π.
Countable sets and function convergence
	{fₙ}, pointwise bounded functions on countable set E
	then it has a point-wise convergent subsequence.
	name the points of E:={xᵢ}
	consider {fₙ(xᵢ)} for a fixed i, this is a bounded sequence of outputs,
		so by BW, it has a convergent subsequence.
		notate fᵢ,ₖ= the kth member of such a subsequence.
		use {f₁,ₙ} as the new sequence to apply on x₂ to get f₂,ₖ
		iterate.
		arrange fᵢ,ₖ in i rows,
		each of them is a subsequence of the previous one,
		and each one converges pointwise on xᵢ
		so that diagonal elements converge for every pt xₖ
