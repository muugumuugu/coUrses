Examples of Sequences
	lim(ⁿ√p)=1 ∀ p > 0
	pf:
		(ⁿ√p)-1 is squeezed between zeroes using binomial theorem.
====== Series ======
series converges if partial sum sequence converges.
ℂ is complete, so a sequence that is convergent is Cauchy.
Cauchy Criterion
	∑aₖ coverges iff sequence of partial sums is cauchy.
	i.e. after some finite index, |ᵐ∑ₙ{aₖ}| is ≤ required tolerance.
	this also says series converges →  aₖ tend to 0.
		n-th term test for convergence
