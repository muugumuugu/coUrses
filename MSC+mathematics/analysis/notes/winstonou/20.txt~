Perfect Space
	All its points are limit points.
ℝᵏ is complete
	Cauchy implies bounded aₙd closed.
	closed aₙd bounded in Euclideaₙ Spaces implies compact, aₙd hence covergent (Heine Borel)
Bounded monotonic sequences are always convergent.
	Monotonic Sequence Theorem:
		Monotonic sequences in complete spaces are Convergent iff Bounded
		if a sequence is monotone increasing aₙd has aₙ upper bound then eventually it must level off
		so, for increasing, sup of the Tails tends to the limit.
		Let ∊ > 0, Since L − ∊ is not an upper bound for S
		∃ m such that aₘ > L − ∊ and moreover since {aₙ} is increasing, ∀  n ≥ m : aₙ > L − ∊.
		but aₙ ≤ L < L + ∊ so ∀ n ≥ N
		L − ∊ < aₙ < L + ∊
		so |aₙ − L| < ∊

lim-inf aₙd lim-sup
	Refinement of the notion of limits.
	Take the set to be limits od all possible subsequences.
	lim-sup = sup of this set
