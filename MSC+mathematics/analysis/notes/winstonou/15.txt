====== Mean Value Theorems ======
Local Maximums
	there is at least one neighbourhood in which all the other points map to lower values.
Critical Point Theorem
	Fermat's Theorem
	if f has a local max @ x
	either f'(x) is undefined, or it is 0.
		f'(x) is defined geometrically means, in a small nghbd around x, f is like a line, so it cant be a sloping one else x wouldnt be a max, and so f'(x)=0. (flat piece)
Rolle's Theorems
	if f is continous on [a,b] is differentiable on (a,b) and f(a)=f(b)
	then ∃ c ∈ (a,b) st f'(c)=0
	If a max/min is in the interior, by fermat's th , we are done. else, since maxes do exist by EVT, then both the max and min lie on a and b, but
	f(a)=f(b) , therefore max=min, and the function is constant, so that
	f'=0 everywhere in (a,b)
Mean Value theorem
	modified rolle's
	f(a)-g(a)=f(b)-g(b)
	then there is a pt c in (a,b) where f'=g'
	from here we get Cauchy's Generalized MVT
		f(b)-f(a)=g(b)-g(a)
		f'(c)(f(b)-f(a))=g'(c)(g(b)-g(a))
	for any g, consider k= [f(b)-f(a)]/[g(b)-g(a)]
	and h(x):=kg(x)
	now h(b)-h(a)=f(b)-f(a) ==> Rolle's :)
