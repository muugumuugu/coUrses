====== the bounded continous function space ======
* C([a,b])= {all real valued functions defined and continous on [a,b]}
* norm of a function in such a space = |f| = sup{|f(x)| : x ∈ [a,b]} , this sup exists and is attained by EVT.
	* valid norm, since it satisfies triangle inequality
* norm defines a metric.
	* d(f,g)=norm of (f-g)
====== uniform converges ======
{fₙ} converges uniformly to f on [a,b] if d(fₙ,f) converges to 0.

====== sequence space ======
* points = binary sequences
* metric = ∑|xₙ-yₙ|/2ⁿ

====== open and closed sets ======
a set is closed in a metric iff its complement in the metric is open.
* coz any pt outsides the set is not a limit point, that is there is some ball around the point entirely in the complement. and so all points in the complement are interior to the complement :)
* now other direction --> if set doesnt contain all its limit points, a lt point lies in the complement, but becoz it's a limit point, all balls around it have point in the set, and thus this point is not an interior point of the complement, and so the complement is not open --> contradiction
