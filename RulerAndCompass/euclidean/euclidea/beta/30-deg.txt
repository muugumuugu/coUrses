====== Construction ======
1. **Let** A be the initial point of the given ray.
2. Construct a circle C1 with an arbitrary center B on the ray and radius AB, intersecting the ray on C
3. Construct the circle C2 with center C and radius BC, intersecting circle C1 on D and E
4. Construct line AD and AE, resulting in two 30 degree angles.

====== Proof ======
You want the angle of 30° to be the inscribed angle of circle B
that will subtends the same arc as a central angle of 60°,
which you can get by constructing an equilateral triangle.
By constructing circle C, you get BCD, an equilateral triangle,
so the arc CD is the arc you want.
