===== Construction =====
1. Construct the circle C1 with center A and radius AB, intersecting AC at D
2. Construct the circle C2 with center B and radius AB, intersecting BC at E
3. Construct the circle C3 with center D and radius AD, intersecting circle C2 at F
4. Construct line AF
5. Construct the circle C4 with center E and radius BE, intersecting circle C1 at G
6. Construct line BG, intersecting AF at H
7. Point at H

====== Proof ======

The first two circles has you construct two isosceles triangles ABD and ABE.
Considering ABD with its base BD and the circle B, you can construct another circle with center D and the same radius
and both circles would intersect along the perpendicular bisector of BD, which coincides with the angle bisector of ∠BAD since ABD is isosceles.
Use the same reasoning by considering ABE with is base AE and the circle A and you can construct the perpendicular bisector of AE, which again coincides with the angle bisector of ∠ABE.
