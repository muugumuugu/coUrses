Three Consonant in Clusters in English Words
Welcome to the class. Today we will talk about clusters and in particular, we will talk about a
special kinds of clusters in English words where we have cluster of three consonants together.
We know little bit about clusters by now, what is a cluster, and then we will continue from there
and go to the examples where we discuss cluster of three consonants in English words. Right at
the outset as usual, I would like you to know that the discussions about specific features of
words, specific intricate details in formation of a word in the way words function, this, these
things are important for us to know for detailed and basic knowledge about language. We are
talking about, for example, a cluster of three consonants is not specific to English alone. So, once
you know about this part of three consonants in a cluster, you can check your language as well,
languages that you speak, languages that you grew up with, and languages that you consider as
your first language, native language, mother tongue et cetera et cetera.
Now, we, you know English already. We are trying to help you make it better. We are trying to
help you feel that you know the language that you speak in a much better way. And once you get
aware of these underlying patterns of the language, your level of confidence in the language that
you speak becomes much better. It is at a completely different level and then that has
implications for learning and if you work with these things, if you keep them in mind, when you
use the language, it has exponential impact on every aspect of use of English. When you use, you
sound more impressive and confident or the other way around. So, let us go ahead and look at it.
So, one more time: a cluster is, clusters are specific to consonants. Only consonants form
clusters.

(Refer Slide Time: 03:19)
So, we know about consonant sounds, we know that every language has limited number of
sounds. In this case, English has 44 sounds out of which we have 24 consonant sounds and 20
vowel sounds. We know about the details of consonant sounds and vowel sounds. We have
talked about how vowel sounds are produced and what is the role of understanding places of
articulation in our oral tract for each one of these consonant sounds, and how when we bring in a
discussion of understanding manners of articulations of these sounds, we understand each sound
in a specific way. So, that is about consonants and vowels.
Then we come to words and we find several interesting patterns in words. We see that first of all
words are not random sounds together. We can put sounds together and make words. So, there
are specific underlying patterns in the formation of words and we are trying to uncover some of
those underlying patterns to understand these things, to understand words in a better way.
So, like, we have will, the patterns that I am talking about are plural formations. So, how
pluralization works in English and then we are looking at how clusters are formed and then other
intricate details that we need to know about words. One of them is understanding syllabification,
aspiration, and stress patterns underlying words.
So, these are the underlying things that we need to know. So, to come back, today we are going
to look at little in little bit more details, cluster one more time. So, a cluster is formed out of
consonants. Two consonants come together, that is as of now it is not a cluster; two consonants
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
next to one another it is not a cluster. It becomes a cluster, when in a word the first member of
the cluster, that is, the first consonant loses its inbuilt vowel 
 and then it becomes a cluster.
A cluster is possible at the initial position of a word, the cluster is also possible in the medial
position of a word and also at a final position in a word. A cluster is also possible in multiples,
we can have two or more clusters within ones word. So, we have looked at some of these
examples, we are going to look at some of those examples, and then we will today specifically
look at a cluster of three consonants.
So, you know about consonants and vowels that we have talked about. So, 
 are consonant
sounds, 
 and 
 are consonant sounds. It like, in words like 
king
 and 
class
 as a sound
is that the initial position of both the words; 
 as a sound is at the initial position of two words
great
 and 
glass
These are also the examples where you have seen 
 and 
 as, 
 and 
 as making clusters,
 and 
 making clusters, 
 and 
 making clusters, and 
 and 
 again making clusters
what this is indicative of certain features of these sounds. So, here we, you see, these are the
places of articulations of the sounds, in the sense that 
 is velar sound and 
 is also a velar
sound.
So, 
 is a non-aspirated non voice sound, 
 is known as non-aspirated but voice sound. Same
way 
 is, and 
 are bilabial sounds according to their places of articulations. But when we
look at specific features, we see 
 and 
 both are unaspirated but 
 is unvoiced and 
 is a
voice sound. These are the distinctive features of some of these sounds that we are talking about
and each one of them has one little short 
 inbuilt in this. So, when we speak 
 we also hear
, when we speak 
 we also hear 
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 08:44)
So, and then we see that there is a way in which we have, we see sounds coming in a word. So,
that is basically CV, CV, CV. Any alternation of this combination gives us multiple sounds. All
words are possible through alternation of these, this sequence. So, a few examples here: words
like 
cluster
 itself, 
bliss
school
scooter
, and 
blast
, just these are random examples. When
you write them, you see this is I want you to write it for some time for some words, this is a
specific exercise that you will do to check yourself whether you understand this in totality or not.
So, please make a list of any 20 words. Like I said, these are the random words and then you try
to write down the sounds involved in those words. For that, you do not have to use phonetic
symbols or phonetic alphabet, you can write it in Roman. But do write an approximant symbol
like I have done, 
cluster
 is spelled this way this is the accurate spelling of cluster. This is
spelling of cluster. But when I am trying to identify sounds, I am trying to write 
 for 
. So, if you try to find this and then you will see, speak the word for yourself
and you will see that these words have 
 and 
. These are the two instances of cluster in this
word. So, and then finally, write it this way that here are the two instances of clusters.
So, this is CC two consonants together, then a will vowel coming in, then again two consonants
together cluster and a vowel coming in and then a consonant at the end of it. So, likewise, when
you do this exercise for all of them, you will see, 
bliss
 has 
 and 
 as a cluster, a cluster at
the initial reason; 
school
 and 
 two consonants at the initial position of the word, making
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
a cluster; 
scooter
 and 
 again, at the initial position; 
blast
 and 
 two consonants as
cluster at the initial release. So, these are some of the examples of clusters in English, where we
see only two consonants together in a cluster.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:52)
So, through this, through the organisation of sounds in this particular way, we observe a
particular type of thing in a word. So, we see, so here is just the example of same thing that we
are giving you, it can be at any other place. I am going to show you an example, that cluster of
three consonants is also possible at the initial position of a word.
But keep in mind, unlike the clusters of two consonants, there are more restrictions on a cluster
of three consonants. So, here is a very specific thing that requires your attention. You see, this is
the fundamental pattern of a word, CV, CV, CV. We can change this sequencing and make it
smaller or bigger and we can get multiple types of sequences and we can get multiple types of
words.
So, for what is special about it? The special thing is, as long as we have a sequence of CV and
CV, we get numerous words including English. We, this is true for all languages, it applies in
English as well. So, check any word that comes to your mind randomly and you will find lots of
words are possible with these combinations.
However, the moment you start looking at clusters, that is, a sequence of two consonant sounds
together in a specific way, the total number of words possible in English comes down to a very
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
small number. How many words do you know which has got clusters? Your answer could be I do
not pay attention to that. That is a very non-natural answer, because when we speak a word in the
language, in in our conversational practices, when we talk to others, when we use the language,
we do not pay attention to these things, but when we want to specifically pay attention to that, we
realise that number of words with clusters is very low.
And so, with that low number also, we have quite a few but we do still see some bit of flexibility
that these clusters are also possible with the initial position of a word, at the middle position of a
word and the final position of the word as long as we cluster of two consonants. The moment we
go to the cluster of three consonants, we find more restrictions, more constraints, that is,
constraints on formation of a word.
And naturally, as a result, we see very few words possible with that kind of restrictions, that kind
of constraint and this is where, what I want to draw your attention to. So, first constraint is, this
sequence of three consonants is only possible, sequence of three consonants in cluster is only
possible at the initial position of the word not at the not at any other position. Maybe there are
few words where you can argue that it is possible, but largely it is possible only at the initial
position of a word.
And when you extend the same thing further, you can check and I am giving you an example,
that cluster of four consonants it is a natural question. If a word is possible with a cluster of three
consonants at the initial position, is it also possible to have a cluster of four consonants at any
position in the word? The answer is no. A cluster of four consonants at the initial position is not
possible, at least in English and also in other languages. So, what is the implication of that? And
why so? So, we will get to know more about this when we look at examples of cluster of three
consonants. But without waiting for an answer to this question, you would have guessed by now,
why is it that we have infinite words with this combination, lower number of words with this
combination, very few handful words with this combination and no words with this
combination?
Answer is pretty simple. As long as we have consonants and vowels alternating, it is easy to
speak and therefore lots of words. The moment we put restrictions on the production, we get few
word numbers, heavier restriction as cluster, fewer than in fewer than a lot; three consonant
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
clusters, much fewer very few; four consonants, not possible. Hope this is making sense to you,
when I discuss some examples probably it will make more sense.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:00)
So, here is what I have been talking about so far and here is what you need to pay attention to
and then I am sure it will be exciting information for you. And then you can do more exercises.
So, remember, the first exercise that we have, that I have pointed to you so far for yourself is
take any 20 words, and write down the sounds involved in those words.
At the second stage, try to write down the sequence of consonants and vowels in those words.
Specifically, second stages specifically try to find words which may have clusters. Now you
know, what a cluster means and see, when you write 20 words together, how many of them are
with clusters, that is cluster of two consonants. Pause there and then once you understand what I
am going to describe to you, what I am going to explain to you then try to find examples of these
types and see how many examples do you come up with.
The point that I was trying to make about constraints becoming heavier, resulting into fewer
number of words possible in English, will become much clearer and you will sound way more
confident. You will, when you speak words, when you speak a sentence, you will have the
confidence that you know a lot about the lot about words. And these are quite observable
patterns that are underlying words that we speak. This is nothing earth-shaking. So, let us look at
this. So, when we have few words here, and what are those words?
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
First let us look at very familiar words like 
spring
stress
screw
splash
, again 
string
scrub
.Just giving you six examples to keep the slide clean. Idea is, there are in this word, there
are three consonant sounds at the initial position of a word which is making a cluster. These
sounds are 
, these sounds are 
 in 
spring
stress
, say the sound to yourself and it
will become clearer.
Stress
 do we hear 
 together where inbuilt vowel is reduced from both, 
 and 
, that
is, first two members of the cluster, and 
 as the last member retains its 
, which does
not remain 
 because of the following vowel it becomes a stress. So, vowel is realised only on
the last one 
 cluster where 
 and 
 have reduced its vowel quality stress.
Speak these words for yourself a couple of times you will realise 
spring
stress
screw
splash
string
scrub
. You would have guessed it by now, I am going to ask you to find more
words of this type. It will be interesting, it will be a very interesting observation, very delicate,
intricate information coming out of this exercise which you will feel it was staring at us but we
were not paying attention to them.
So, what do we see? We have in a word like a 
spring
; in a word like 
stress
have 
; and in a word like 
screw
 we have 
. Again, in a word like 
splash
we have 
; in a word like 
string
 we have 
; in a word like 
scrub
So, try finding some more words of this type which has got three consonants as clusters and see
what you notice. So, what I mean by three consonants as cluster is you have C C C in the
beginning and in this word you have a vowel coming in e and then final consonant, 
spring
Stress
, three consonants again a vowel and then a consonant.
Screw
 three consonants 
screw
, one can argue here, but you have three consonants as cluster
and then vowel coming in. 
Splash
 three consonants a vowel and then again, a consonant. So,
what do you see here, please pay attention to this one, please pay attention to this. You see that
the pattern is almost the same. For all these two things we could have just written C C C V and
C. So, this is the pattern underlying all these words. This is what, were, what I wanted you to pay
attention to that the underlying pattern of words is completely rule-governed. It is not random.
Then when you pay specific attention, now you go into the details of that. Please pay attention to
the sequence of three consonants, which is true for all these 6 examples. You see, we see first
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
consonant is 
, second consonant is 
 and third consonant has 
. What do you see? Look at,
whenever we look at a pattern we try to look at common points and the things that are different.
What do we see here?
The first member of this consonant across the board is 
 as a sound. We have discussed 
as a consonant. Then you see, second member is either 
 or 
 or 
 in all of them, either 
 or 
 and third member is in these three all of them are 
. In these three, you see one 
 and
two 
. So, basically, we can say the, when we are talking about the first three consonants, the
first one is always 
, second one is either 
 or 
 and third one is either 
 or 
So, this is the underlying pattern. Now, it is very interesting to note that, what is interesting to
note here? Any word that you find which has got three consonants as clusters in the initial
position of a word, can only have this much pattern underlying it. See, what a strict rule this is
and because it is so rigid pattern, too many words are not possible. By too many, I mean infinite
number of words are not possible.
And when I say limited number of words, even if it is 100, that is not too many given the
possibility of infinite words that can be that is probably possible in any language. So, remember,
we have been talking about, we can ask these questions to ourselves, we can ask this question to
anybody. This question may sound ridiculous, but it helps us understand a lot. How many words
of English do you know? It will sound like a ridiculous question, who knows how many words I
know? Nobody counts, nobody wants to count and it is true. That is the answer is very simple.
We do not know the total number and when we do not know the total number, we can easily say
it is infinite number of words possible.
So, remember, with 44 sounds in English 20 vowels and 24 consonants, infinite number of words
are possible for a simple reason, that there is no constraint on repetition of sounds in the same
word or the length of a word. We do see words, which very rarely, we have words beyond six
syllables, we do see words very rarely, which are even five and four syllables. Most of the words
that we have are either three syllable words or two syllable words or one syllable word. True.
But still, they are infinite, because restrictions are very few, alternations of consonant and vowel
is possible.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
The moment we make these constraints heavier, that is two consonants together, the number
becomes, number shrinks. So, the moment we go to three consonants as clusters, the numbers
shrinks even further and we are left with only a few, that is in 100s because of this rigid
constraint.
Coming back to this point, what is common between 
 and 
? They are both liquid sounds in
natural languages. What is common between 
, and 
 is a bilabial sound, 
 is an
alveolar sound and 
 is a velar sound. According to places of articulations, there are three
distinct places of articulations for these sounds.
But there is another way of looking at it, and then you can see that that is common between these
two, that each one of them is a stop sound. That is, stop means when the flow is totally, it is a
plosive, the other word for that is plosive another term that we use for that is plosive. A simpler
term is stopped because the flow of air for a moment completely gets blocked for the production
of the sounds. So, 
 that is not how we speak when we speak, but when you have to
speak these sounds in isolation, you will realise that these are, there is a total closer total stop and
then explosion out of that. Therefore this sound, these sounds are also called plosive sounds. So,
either one of the three and then the first one is s, which is a sibilant, which is, you know about
the place of articulation of this.
So, this is the underlying pattern of three consonants as clusters. Now, every word that you are
going to find which has three consonants as cluster, you are going to observe the following that it
is starts with a 
 sound. Second sound is either 
 or 
 and third sound is one of the two
. Try finding it out, have fun with this exercise and then you get to know the role of
you get to know I hope, by the end of this discussion, you feel that you know quite a bit about
words, that is, formation of words, constraints on the formation of words, and how we
understand them and why they are so rigidly rule-governed and not random.
And on top of that, we can have infinite number of words possible out of a very finite set of 44
sounds in the language. That is the magic of language, that is how we learn, that is how we pay
attention to these facts and learn. This makes you feel good about what you know for English
and we look forward to your questions. Thank you.
