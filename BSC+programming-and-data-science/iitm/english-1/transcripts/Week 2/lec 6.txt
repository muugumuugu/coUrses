What is Good Vocabulary - Part 3
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
In the earlier sessions, we have seen that what is generally known as vocabulary is not just
words; it also includes our knowledge about words; it includes our knowledge of words and
knowledge about words. So, for instance, we know that a college is a noun. So, we not only
know the word college, but we also know that it is a noun, we also know that it is a singular
noun, we know that it is a bisyllabic word, we know it is spelt in a certain manner, you have
C at the beginning of the word and E at the end of the word, we know your spelling, we know
how it follows. We know what word can come after this.
After college, it is a noun, we can further modify it we say we can say college of commerce,
or commerce college or we can say College of Engineering or we can say engineering
college, these collocations, and then we need a verb then we will have to say college teaches
higher skills, skills which are higher than those taught in schools. So, all these things,
knowledge of words and knowledge about words constitute makes our vocabulary; all this
knowledge together makes our vocabulary.
So, we have already seen that a good vocabulary, by large generally speaking, has lots of
words, a variety of words. Things like synonyms, antonyms, homophones, homonyms, then
we not only know these synonyms and antonyms, we also know collocation, which word
goes with which word you know. When we have a verb, it is generally followed by a noun.
Drink is a verb. Now, it cannot take all nouns. It is followed by solid, liquid nouns. Drink
milk, drink water, drink tea, drink coffee like that. It goes if it is 8, then it requires a solid
noun. To follow it, eats pudding, eats biscuit, eats cake, eats mutton, eats fish, eats rice, eats
vegetables. That is how it goes. So, we also know that. Go next.

(Refer Slide Time: 3:21)
This is what collocation and we spoke about collocation. Now, how any word goes with other
words? If you have a verb and you want to describe it, how in what manner he walked? Did
he walk slow or fast? Was he walking happily or sadly? So, you know, can modify, adverbs
can modify verbs. So, collocation is the combination of words, and there are constraints; it is
not that any word can occur with any other word; it can occur only with certain words; only
certain words can occur with any other word. There are conventions, there are rules, and all
those that have a good vocabulary know these things next.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:27)
Then there is something else. Final, no word is used in isolation, except perhaps in a very
highly specific context. In the armed forces, the commander can say 
 that is a sentence
by itself. 
Run, stop, halt, turn, move, shoot, aim, fire
, that is a very specific kind of
vocabulary. But ordinarily speaking, in our everyday life, we do not speak words generally in
isolation; we use them in context. Even what we saw in isolation is not in isolation. There is a
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
hidden sentence when the commander tells his soldiers run; he means to say you, gentlemen,
please run. So, it comes in a context.
In ordinary life, the context is very explicitly described in ordinary language. We always
speak in sentences, in phrases, longer discourses, we write in paragraphs. There words do not
occur the way they are cited in a dictionary; look at the text before us look at this highlighted
paragraph, take your time read it. Change.
(Refer Slide Time: 6:20)
A lot of words in the paragraph do not occur the way they have incited in any dictionary;
their form changes. So, for instance, in this text, we have something called weeks. In the
dictionary, it was cited as a week, but here, it has become week, plus plural, it is a noun, it
takes a plural to say, several weeks, six weeks, ten weeks. So, ten had changed it. Several had
changed it; many had changed it. You cannot say many week, we say many weeks. You
cannot say ten week; of course in a specific phrase, you can say it is a ten week guarantee
period. Because you are there, you know, both ten and week, go with guarantee, which
together modify period.
But that is a different context. When it occurs when week occurs by itself as a noun, then you
have ten weeks, six weeks, four weeks, two weeks, many weeks, a few weeks, so it changes.
Take another word later. Late is an adjective which means after the expected time, later
means more after the expected time, somebody who is late came at 10:30 he was expected at
10, somebody who came later came at 10:35. So, the other, the verb, the noun, or the verb,
the adverb has, in this case, verb, he came late. So, late is the adverb for the verb came, later
is also the same thing.
John came later, Mary came late, and John came later, or Aravind came late. Sham came
later; we can say that. Similarly, came, the dictionary does not sight came the dictionary says,
Come, it is a verb, but here, as happens in all languages, the verb can change for also
according to tense, since the speaker here wants to use it in the past tense form so, come had
changed to came.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
The point I am making is words do not exist; sometimes they do, when no change is required,
but sometimes, words occur in a changed form, not in isolation, not as they were given in a
dictionary. You can look at other words, forgave it in the dictionary it was forgive, but here it
occurs as forgave past and sins, in dictionary it is sin, singular, but here it is plural Sin plus
plural next.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:03)
Starting the dictionary says start, but here a progressive mode marker, the action is in
progress has been added. So, it is starting. Similarly, political it has come out of politics, the
politics is a noun, but because here something is to be described, what kind of activities did
Swami get in, go back to the paragraph, what kind of activities did Swami get in third line
middle of the centre line Swami got into political activities.
So, activities is a noun, and it is being modified by the adjective political whereas, however,
the political will made by changing politics from noun to adjective, when it was politics a
noun, we added other two letters, other two sounds and made it 
 so, it became political, it
became an adjective to qualify a noun. So, words change their form in a sentence in use in
context, look at acquisition which has come from acquire, meant has come from mean go
next.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:45)
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
Like that you know, you can check, go next.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:56)
Now, you may have noticed that there are two kinds of changes, there are two sorts of
changes. In many cases, the cited word was a verb and here in use in the paragraph, it is still
(remain) retained as a verb. Say, for instance, a start with a verb starting it is a verb, sin was a
noun, sins it is still a noun. So, you know, there are some changes where a verb remains a
verb. Though there may be some minor changes in it, if it was in the present tense, it change
in past tense come became came from forgive, we got forgave
 come, came; forgive, forgave.
So, some changes were still there, but it was still a verb.
The noun was still a noun, though some change happened. For example, singular nouns sin
became plural noun sins, activity was singular, but in the plural, it became activities. So,
some changes still there. But a noun still remains a noun, a verb still remains a verb, an
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
adjective is still relate is an adjective or an adverb, and it still remains an adjective or an
adverb. So, there are though changes, but there are some other changes, and it happens in all
languages of the world.
In all-natural languages of the world, be the Arabic or Persian or Chinese or Sanskrit, no
matter Latin or Greek, no matter what language words in context, sometimes change the
dictionary form, they do not occur, sometimes in the dictionary form, because of the word
that has gone before or because of some words that are likely to come later. And these
changes that words undergo can be of two different kinds. One, where a verb remains a verb,
a noun remains a noun, and an adjective remains an adjective, in spite of some minor
changes.
But there can be another kind of change where a verb can become look at the third bullet
point where the verb can become a noun, such as when you say, driver. Now driver is a noun,
which has come out of the verb called 
drive
. Or nouns can become a verb. Say, for
example, 
person
 is a noun. And you can have a verb called personify, nation is a noun,
national is an adjective that had been that has been derived from the noun called 
nation
. But
national adjective itself can change into a verb, we get nationalise, and it can further become
a noun. We can say nationalisation.
So, all languages have these processes, processes of deriving a new word out of an existing
word. We will talk in some greater detail about that a little later, but at this moment, I want us
to understand that words undergo two kinds of changes in a context, in a sentence. In many
cases, their category does not change. A verb remains a verb, a noun remains a noun, and an
adjective remains an adjective, or adverb, remains an adverb. But in some cases, it changes; a
noun can become a verb, a verb can become a noun, an adjective can become a verb, a verb
can become an adjective or an adverb; all of these possibilities exist.
Slow
 is an adjective; it can become slowly, 
hard
 is an adjective; it can become hardly, you
know, all that is possible. So, there are two kinds of changes. One can be called category
retaining changes, where categories do not change, and the other is category changing
changes, the category changes, turn next. Come back previous. So, those where the verb
remains a verb. If there is any change there, and it still remains a verb, if there is any change
there, it still remains a noun. There is any change there; it still remains an adjective.
Like late was allergic to later was also an adjective. Late was late is an adverb; later is also an
adverb. They came late, and they came later. So, late and later, both are adverbs. Though
their degree has changed from positive, late is positive, later is comparative. The latest
would-be superlative. A last would be superlative. Mary came late, John came later, and
Simon came last. Last is superlative. But they are all adverse even now; Mary came, came is
a verb, late, late modifies the verb. So, it still remains a verb; some changes have occurred.
Verbs undergo changes of tense, verbs undergo changes of voice, verbs undergo changes of
tense, etcetera, adjectives undergo changes of degrees, nouns undergo changes of number
person.
There are these two kinds of changes where one is where a noun or a verb or an adjective or
an adverb still remains an adverb, in spite of some minor changes, and we saw that these
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
minor changes in the case of the verb can be changed of tense or voice or aspect, in the case
of noun it can be changed as of number or person, in the case of adjectives and adverbs it can
be a change of degrees.
But there also are cases where a verb becomes a noun, and we saw that driver is derived out
of drive. Personify comes out of person. So, person is noun, for verb is personified. Personal
is an adjective; it comes from noun called person. So, there are this other kinds of change,
where the category changes where the verb becomes a noun, the noun becomes adjective,
adjectives become adverb, adverb becomes a verb, that sort of thing. Let us see, let us look at
some examples.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:01)
So, that we understand them better, you know these are the basic principles, and adjective can
become a noun, or a noun can become an adjective, there is a lot of mutual interchange you
can see. So, you know, as I said, politics is a noun, but once you add 
 or once to add two
sounds, 
aa la
, it becomes, it becomes political 
 disappears and it becomes political. So,
the noun changes to an adjective.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:36)
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
Next, look at some examples you know, the given word is politics, the dictionary tells you
gives you politics, but in the context here it has become political or Rajam forgave all
political activities of Swami, acquire changes to acquisition, slow changes to slowness, stupid
changes to stupidity, mind changes to mental, but look at that kind of change. Politics which
are noun as become political adjective, acquire that was a verb has become acquisition, which
is a noun, slow that was an adjective has become a noun slowness, stupid which is an
adjective has become stupidity which is a noun, mind which was a noun has become an
adjective, which is mental.
So, all of these varieties of changes interchanges happen of words within a sentence, and
anyone who claims to have a vocabulary, anyone who claims any knowledge of the language,
knows these things. And therefore, it is important for us as students of the English language
to know when which change can occur, what can be the form of change, and what can be a
context of change. These two are also parts of our knowledge of language next.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:29)

I am going to give you an example. Look at the extract below. And I am sure you know those
words. If you do not, please look up a dictionary, you have a dictionary on your mobile
phone, you have a dictionary on a laptop computer, we look up your dictionary and tell us
number 1, which words have changed, it is not that all words change, some words have
changed, which are those words that had one form in the dictionary, but here in the passage in
the context, they occur in another form.
How have they changed? Have they
, what is the direction of what is the process of change?
Has 
 been added? Has 
 been added? Has a known marker been added had adjective
marker been added? Has the verb marker been added? What kind of change this word has
undergone. And third and final, just tell us if this change is one of inflexion, a noun changing
to a noun, a verb changing to a verb, or it is a derivation where a noun had changed to a verb,
or a verb had changed to the noun.
So, look at the passage and let us look at the words, and number 1 say which words have
changed. Number 2, tell us how they have changed
taking what losing what they have
changed. And finally, tell us if these changes are one of inflexion verb remaining verb, noun
remaining noun, adjective and adverb remaining adjective and adverb or it is a derivation. A
verb has become a noun; a noun has become a verb, etcetera.

Look at the passage. Take your time. This passage comes from RK Narayan
s very popular
early book, Swami and his friends. And I guess I think it is chapter 13. You will enjoy
reading it, go to the next.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 24:50)
Look at the changes; these words have changed. I have not included those words that have
not changed. But these words have changed; for example, making the original form of this
word in the dictionary is make, but here progressive aspect marker that the action is in
progress has been added. So, it is not make it is making. It is a change of inflexion. Similarly,
theatrical, so theatre is noun, to this and objective marker, 
 has been added, so that it
becomes theatrical. And a noun has become an adjective. Therefore, it is a change of
derivation. next.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:49)
You can look at the changes; look at this fifth row consistently. A consistent is an adjective.
By adding 
, which is an adverb marker, the speaker, the writer changes it to consistently,
which is an adjective changing to an adverb. So, it is a derivation, it has it is a change of
derivation, but days, day in the dictionary is cited as a noun, here you have added a plural
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
marker to make it days not one day not two it is two days, three days and because a noun still
remains a noun, it is a change of inflexion, not of derivation, next.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:51)
Look at it next.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:59)
These things are pretty mechanical; machines can be programmed to give you output in this
manner, you can give it any text and following certain algorithms, the machine can read that
text and can tell you which word has changed in which manner and whether it is a change of
inflexion or derivation. You can also create some exercises for any book, practically technical
or literary or any talk technical or literary from the internet is alright, take that text and create
some of your own exercises.
Randomly pick out a few lines and look at the words and say, these words have changed from
their dictionary citation. And then what kinds of change is that? How, what is the process of
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
change? This kind of exercise will not only reinforce your teaching, it will become stronger,
you will become more confident of yourself, and you will also understand the process of
change, how and why languages and words in a context change; is the change random
anything anywhere anyway.
Usually, nothing like that happens in nature. All Changes in nature, including those in
languages, are regulated changes. They occur under certain principles, certain laws, certain
rules; it is only that we do not understand them generally. Thank you very much.
