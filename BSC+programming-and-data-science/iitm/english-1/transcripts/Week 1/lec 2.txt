Sounds and Writing Symbols in English
Welcome to the class. Today we will talk about sounds of English. We are going to talk
about writing system in English. These are the two separate things and right at the outset,
that is, right at the beginning of this class, I would like to tell you to pay attention to these
things carefully. In order to learn different aspects of English language it is important to
separate these two.
Once again, we are talking about writing system in English and sound system of English.
If we try to simplify it further, we are going to be talking about how we spell things, that
is, writing system and what happens when we speak. Are these two things different? If it
is surprising to you, then you require even closer attention to these facts, they are very
different things.
Speaking is contingent upon sound system and writing, particularly in English, has a
different system. That is, we follow, we have different symbols to represent sounds of
English. We are going to elaborate on that today. As a note, as a footnote to this, let me
also add to you that learning to write is one of the skills that we can learn by putting in
efforts, but learning to speak, particularly for children, is quite intuitive and once we pay
attention to these things, things become easier for us to learn.
Let us move ahead and talk about it. One more disclosure right at the beginning, we are
going to be talking about writing system and sound system. We do not intend, or we do
not employ that we are going to begin teaching you alphabets. We understand that you
know language and almost all of you are at many different levels in the process of
learning.
Through these things we are trying to work on something, we are trying to draw your
attention to something that is rarely paid attention to in the process of learning. So, let me
talk more about it when we move further. So, one more time: learning to speak and
learning to write and we are going to look at these things for the purpose of learning
English.
When you learnt English alphabet for the first time, I am sure you have paid attention to
this but I want to draw your attention to more questions and then going to invite you to
check if these questions came to your mind. I am sure what you see on the screen is
familiar to you. These are 26 symbols of English writing system. Depending upon when
we started to learn English writing system, we have to learn this thing first and these
things are taught in different ways. Whatever method you applied to learn these things
you have learnt these 26 letters they are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u,
v, w, x, y and z.
Right from this point when we, the last part, when we, some people say this as 
 some
people say as 
. The difference is between British and American spoken system. In
American system, this is known as 
, in a British system this is known as 
. That is
how we, irrespective of the method applied in learning, we learn these things. Then you
must have learned the second set as well, set one and set two. The difference between
these two sets is one is called upper case and the other is called lower case.
So, uppercase symbols and lowercase symbols, I do not mean anything else when I say
symbols, I know they are alphabets and they are used in writing system but the reason
why I am calling them symbols again and again is very simple and I want you to know
that. The reason is we use these symbols to represent sounds that we speak, and we will
dwell upon that when we move further, but let us stick to the other question for the time
being and here is what I am inviting you to think.
Why do we have two different sets, why do we have upper case symbols and lowercase
symbols? I know one answer is very simple: we use uppercase in the beginning of a
word, when those words are used in a sentence, we used the upper case only at the first,
at the initial position of the first word in the sentence and then there are lot of words
which begin with upper case, we use upper cases in abbreviations and so on.
We know, that is not my question. My question, is couldn
t we have just one? What
difference would it make? Why do we need two different sets? Think about it, not sure
we have an answer to this question. Have you found an answer to this question for
yourself so far? Please look at that try to find an answer for yourself, this is just an
interesting thing, this does not have much to do with learning part. Nonetheless whether
or not we have an answer to the question, we know that we have two different sets and
we use them, we know how to use them.
So like I said, upper case, like one of them at the initial position of a word and at several
words within a sentence also but not every word within a sentence begins with uppercase.
So, most often proper names at initial position, we use uppercase like names etcetera.
We were talking a minute ago, we were talking about different methods of learning.
Some people learn it through rhymes. They have for particularly for kids, there are a lot
of lines designed so that it sounds little melodious, musical, and becomes easy for
children to memorize them, and at the next stage of learning is they give words like 
a for
apple
b for ball
c for cat
d for dog
e for elephant
f for fan
g for girl
h for
house
i for ink.
, etcetera.
I remembered the other ones too but I have purposely left them blank because I want you
to test your own understanding of learning alphabet at the initial point and see if you can
fill up the rest of it. Now, so the first thing is learning the whole symbol through rhymes
and then giving examples of those rhymes. So that, these are the two different stages.
Then I asked you a question, why two different sets, like why uppercase and lowercase?
You are going to, you are going to think about that.
Now, here is another question and with that question we begin our discussion in more
serious sense. When we say 
a for apple
, what do we mean? Say the word 
apple
 for
yourself and see if you hear 
 in that. Apple, apple where do we hear 
 in that? There
is no 
 sound in the word 
apple
. This is a disconnect. So what we basically mean, and
let me underline this again, I am not trying to make fun of it by drawing your attention to
this, neither I am trying to ridicule the sense employed within this process.
What I am trying to tell you is when we teach kids and when kids memorize these things
a for apple
b for ball
c for cat
d for dog
 etcetera, etcetera, what happens in that
is they are trying to learn, or the purpose is to teach them writing system. What is the
writing system? In the word 
apple
, the first letter is 
. In the, in the word 
ball
, the
first letter is 
. That is the reason why we say 
a for apple
 or 
a as in apple
b as in
ball
c as in cat
So, we mean the first symbol, first letter in the writing of the word cat is 
 because there
is no sound as 
 in the word 
. What is the first sound in the word 
, which is
represented with 
? That sound is 
. So, what are the sounds in this word? I am
purposely taking this monosyllabic one small word 
 and 
. So, the word begins
with 
 sound but when we write the word 
 at the initial position we write 
So, and if you look at all of them I have given you just few examples of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9 words. In each one of them, there is no 
 sound in the word 
apple
, no 
 sound
there is no 
 sound, no 
 sound, no 
 sound. In the word 
elephant
, look at
elephant
 do we have 
? It is 
 elephant; 
 there is no 
 sound because the sound is
, the sound is 
; girl 
, the sound is 
; house begins with 
, the sound is 
So, if you pay attention to many words in English, you will realize that the way we speak
a word is different from the way we write, in the sense that there is no direct one-to-one
correspondence between the sound system of English, that is, the way words are spoken,
and the way it is written with the symbols representing those sounds. This makes the
learning little more difficult but my purpose of discussing this for you here is not to show
you difficulty. My purpose is to draw your attention to this and please remember a key
word here, paying attention. Please keep paying attention to differences and similarities
and the points where we are trying to draw your attention. An effort in looking at
underlying pattern, an effort in paying attention to these things will take you several steps
ahead.
Learning as you know, is subconscious process. By paying attention to these things, this
effort will fix several things in your subconscious and then you will sound more
confident. So, first step is to pay attention, the second step is to allow these things to
function your subconscious, to fix some of them and then third step is to observe your
own output, whether your output has impact of your learning or not. Watch yourself
through this process and you will see the results coming out, that is, results of your efforts
coming out in your performance.
That is a note on learning but, so the idea is not to show you difficulties, so the idea is not
to show you problems, but the idea is to bring your attention to this point. Point is, there
is a disconnect between the two, not a big problem but we pay attention to this and
through that we learn; we give priority to learning sounds and I am going to show you
these things further and then it will have an impact on learning.
We will also talk about sounds to see the differences between, that is our effort in paying
attention to sound system of English will also help us pay attention to how English
sounds are different from sounds in the language that we primarily speak and that
difference, that understanding, is going to sort them out vividly, clearly and it will have
impact on your learning.
So, this is what you have seen. This is just another table of uppercase and lowercase
symbols. So, we use only these 26 letters to represent all sounds of English; we are going
to talk about all of them. We are going to talk about each one of them and then we are
going to find them in different words and you will see how they help you learn to speak,
they help you learn to write and they help you feel more confident in writing, reading and
speaking and also in various different aspects, various different stages of your learning
English.
So, here is one more time I want your attention. I like this table and therefore, I brought
this for you. So, this is uppercase, this is lowercase. Uppercase, lowercase and this is
English, this is a spelling of these letters, that is, how these, when we say 
 how it
sounds and in this one, you have been given a phonetic transcription of sounds involved,
so pay attention to that.
So, here is one, so you will understand why I have put these square brackets. The first
letter is 
. How do we read it? 
. So 
 and long 
, so the letter, the
pronunciation of the letter itself has at least two sounds in it, that is 
 and long 
Same thing with 
 and long 
. So, look at this it 
b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l,
m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w
, look at this word this sound 
. The pronunciation of this
one symbol involves sounds which is like a word; 
x, y, zed or 
 as I said, you can see
here z.
So, this chart helps you see the sounds involved in pronouncing these symbols, that is,
names of these symbols 
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y and
. One more time: take any word, any one of these letters, and see like 
 and long
 and long 
 and long 
. So, they sound like a word and when we
learn them, memorize them that is how we say these symbols.
Now, so that that is about writing. At this point when I am talking about the difference
between writing and speech sounds, I am going to draw another distinction and we will
come back to these consonants and vowels again but it is important to mention them right
at this point.
So, when we, when we learn how many vowels are there in English language, quite often
you will find people say 
and they are a, e, i, o, u; A, E, I, O, U. So, these are lower
case, these are uppercase. What we, and that is not wrong, what we mean in that is, some
of these symbols represent vowel sounds. That is another thing which I want you to pay
attention to.
Some of these, these five symbols, represent vowel sounds in English writing system.
However, when we look at vocalic sounds, vowel sounds, so all the sounds are classified
in two categories. One is consonants and the other is vowel. The reason why we are
talking about vowels first is because vowels are more fundamental to natural language
and you will see the meaning of more fundamental, being more fundamental to natural
language when we move on further.
So, here we have, this chart gives you an example of 20 vowel sounds in English
language. 20 vowel sounds in English language and this chart also gives you an example
of a word where they occur. So, look at this, look at some of them at least: 
 it has a
vowel 
 short 
 and these sounds are underlined in these words; 
. So 
, a short 
book
 short 
mother
mother
bean
, burn,
barn
born
boon
bite
bait
house
poor
. These are 20
vowel sounds in English language.
Please look at this chart, these examples carefully and read them several times, these
examples. Pay attention to these sounds in these words. What it will do is it will get you
think about vowel sounds in remaining words that you know, vowel sounds in other
words that you will speak, other than these. What you must also do is find another 5
words at least for each one of these vowel sounds. So, that means I am asking you to
make a list of hundred English words, where 5 examples for each one of these vowel
sounds.
You do not have to do that in one go, you do not have to do that in one day, but if you
can come up with a set of 20 words, 20 different words 5 times for each one of these 20
vowels you will get an idea of how vowel sounds work. If 5 sets sound too much, start
with one and then try to pay attention to words that we write or speak, what are the
vowels involved in those words? It will be quite an exercise and will have serious impact
on how we understand vowel system, vowel sounds of English language.
One more time, to underline this thing: all these vowel sounds, all these vowel sounds
become clearer in the words and we are not talking about again, spelling, that is, the way
we write words; we are talking about sounds the way we speak.
Same way, there are 24 consonant sounds in English and this chart gives you example of
each one of them within a word. So, some of the words are repeated and those sounds are,
those consonant sounds are given in capital. So what we are doing here is like 
, the
sound is 
, we want your attention to sound 
 attention to sound 
attention to sound 
 attention to sound 
 attention to sound 
attention to sound 
 attention to sound 
thought
them
treasure
shine
sing
. So, in
the word 
sing
, we want your attention to 
 sound. So, these are 20 consonant sounds
in English.
One more time, I want to repeat myself and I mean that, is it possible for you to find at
least 5 set of words with these sounds? It should be easier with consonants. Please pay
attention to them, please do this exercise for yourself and once you have these sets ready,
the only thing you will need to do afterwards or you will end up doing afterwards is every
word that you have, not in formal writing or speaking, not every moment every time but
in your subconscious, many times you will end up finding consonants and vowel sounds
in the words that you speak and that is a very productive exercise to do.
So, with that, we are talking about 24 plus 20, that is 44 sounds of English language.
Remember, there are only 44 sounds in English language and these are the 44 sounds that
are responsible for infinite number of words that we make using these sounds. We speak
infinite number of words using these sounds and I mean infinite in the sense that nobody
knows total number of words in any given language. Do you know about total number of
words, either in English or in the language that you speak as your primary language, as
your native language? Do you know the total number of words?
So, how and why a finite set of 44 odd sounds are responsible for infinite set of words in
any spoken language of the world including English is no less than miracle. We will
continue talking about some of them for the purpose of learning English.
This is a promise. So one more time, this is yet another table where 24 vowel sounds
underlined colored with their phonetic transcriptions like 
five
thin
that
nose
thing
half
church
kind
ship
measure
work
. So 24 sounds.
And then you have, again some examples here and finally I know I have talked about too
many exercises for one day but they are not too difficult exercises. We will stop for today
by telling you one more time, you do not have to do all these things in one go but for the
purpose of learning, for the purpose of checking whether the things that we have
discussed, that is, writing using symbols as a completely different exercise than
understanding sounds of the language when we speak, they are two different things.
Sounds are definitely represented using, 44 sounds are represented using 26 symbols in,
for the purpose of writing. That itself is a complex process which we go through and
learn but paying attention, paying close attention to these 44 sounds of English is going to
improve the way we are going to speak or when you are speaking, it
s going to help you
improve your speaking better. Thank you.
