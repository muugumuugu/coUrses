 ## Lec 01 - Learning English
>[yt - lec](https://youtu.be/DgKYu1pi3qg)

### how language works.
+ a product of human mind's tendency to fins and apply patterns.
+ so
 in younger age
 reverse engeineering patterns comes naturally
 since no pattern is already fed.
+ after 15 years some older patterns have to be ignored which makes learning slightly obstructed in case of languages.
+ but the primal language does ease one into another language
 on the surface it might seem erranous
 but communication in the newer language becomes possible thru the older rules too.

+ Computation of Language occurs using  ***Univeral Grammar*** and the ***L**anguage **A**quisitiom **D**evice*.
+ As adults
 manipulating the already set vocal cords and articultors also takes extra effort.

 ## Lec 02 - Sounds and Writing Symbols in English

### Symbols in English - Two Sets
#### 26 Symbols
>>+ Upper Case
>>+ Lower Case

#### Phonetics

+ when you see the two dots /:/ it means the sound is long
+ each symbol represents a sound
+ when you see this dash /’/ it means the next syllable is stressed

##### VOWELS
+ Short vowels

 ## Lec 03 - Speech sounds in English
>[yt - lec](https://youtu.be/MMBrfQC0V9A)

### Vowel v/s Consonants
> Vowels are *nearly free* flow of air, minimum obstruction from articulators.

> Consonants require obstructions to be produced, and so cannot be streched over a duration

### Articulation of Consonants
+ (A) aspiration -> extra aur flow.
+ (V) voice -> extraneous vibration of vocal chords.
+ Normal -> Nasal, produced by lowering uvula.

|&&| -V _ -A | -V _ +A | +V _ -A | +V _ +A | Normal

 ## Lec 04 - Articulation of Vowel and Consonant sounds

# WEEK 2

 ## Lec 01 - Consonant Clusters in English Words
[yt - lec](https://youtu.be/Hpmh-iv6e4I)

### Vowel Builds the Word.

> All words have at least 1 vowel sound.

> All consonants have an inbuilt vowel.

### Common Sequences
+ CVCV
+ CVC
+ VC
+ CVV
+ CCVC
+ CVCC

### Clusters
+ inbuilt vowel gets reduced for all but last consonant to form a multi consonant syllable


------
 ## Lec 02 - Three Consonants in Clusters in English Vowel

>[yt - lec](https://youtu.be/BR7dQgD8qlk)

+ rarer words, restrained word construction
+ only possible, largely, in first position.
+ cluster of more than three consonants does not exist in english.

### underlying pattern
+ second consonant is always a stop sound.
+ third one is l/r
+ first is s.

+ clusters are specific to consonant

+ words are not random sounds
   + there are specific underlying patterns

+ When the first consonant in a CC pair loses its inbuilt vowel,
   + becomes a cluster

+ 2-Clusters can appear anywhere in the word.

> Excercise -- 20 Words - phonetic rep

> Exercise -- Write the CV pattern of these words

> Exercise -- Identify Clusters in these words.


+ Number of words where patterns other than CV/VC alternation are used, like 2-clusters, or 3-clusters, is very very less, since consonants cannot be easily spoken in sequence
   + because consonants are not free flow of air.


### 3 - cluster words
+ inbuilt vowel removed from both first 2 consonants of the triplet.

#### Pattern for 3-clusters
1. S
2. p/t/k
3. r/l

------
 ## Lec 03 - Syllables And Words.

>[yt - lec](https://youtu.be/RAFLD5HY6Jc)

### POS -- > Classes of Words.

### Syllables and Words

>Words
>>distinct meaningful element of speech or writing.

+ POS is defined for a word
+ Sub/Ver/Obj - relations of a word to other words in the sentence in which it is used.

>Syllable:
>> Parts of words.

>> Unit of organization for sequence of speech components.

>> The pieces which when joined with pauses form the word from which they are extracted.


+ Each syllable has *at least one vowel* called its **nucleus**
+ Onsent : a consonant or consonant clusters
+ Rhyme : splits word into nucleus and coda.


### examples
#### 3-syllables
+ e-nar-jii
+ he-ri-tej
+ kae-pi-tal
+ saf-far-ing

#### 4-syllable words
+ in-vi-si-ble
+ e-du-ke-shan
+ a-qua-rii-am
+ in-fi-ni-tii

> We stress more on one specific syllable in multisyllabic words

#### Sub/Verb/Obj --> Grammatical Relations within a Sentence

#### Syllables

+ Parts of a Sound, split by Pauses in the pronounciation.
+ Every Syllable has a Vowel - called the nucleus.
+ Consonants in the syllable are called its initial and final margins.
+ Onset = beginning cluster
+ Rhyme & Coda -- ????
---
+ Multi Syllabic words have a stress pattern to highlight one vowel.

## Lec 01 - Stress in Words

> [yt - lec](https://youtu.be/8gud9XJsL6k)

> Stress is the difference in artiulation that creates a prominent feature to the word.
>> Syllabification, and stress patterns are intutive things.\

### General Patterns for Stress Syllable
1. If **noun** stems from monosyllabic word --> root word
2. Disallybic **verb** --> 2nd Syllables (differentiates verb form from noun form)
3. Compounf **noun** --> 1st part
4. Ending in *shion*  / *ic* sound --> on the syllable before this suffix
5. ending in *ee* / *oo* --> on the suffix itself.


----

## Lec 02 - Plurality in English#

> [yt - lec](https://youtu.be/42hufxqiOAk)

## Pluralization
 + generally using suffixes
   + /z/ or /s/
 + Dog*s*, Babi*es*
 + exceptions
  + relics of old english
  +  children,teeth,..

## Pattern - Plural Markers (sound)

+ /p/,/t/,/k/  --> /s/
+ else --> /z/

-----
## Lec 03 - Aspiration in English Words - 1

> [yt - lec](https://youtu.be/mbE_MAhkj_A)

+ p,t,k are voiceless stop sounds.
	+ aspirated if they are at the initial position  of the stress syllables.

## Lec 05 - Syllables and Stress in Words

> [yt - lec](https://youtu.be/BQDrv4mQHFE)

### Syllabification
> Jaw Drop Test:
>> # syllables = # times jaw drops to pronounce word.

### Identifying Stress Syllable
#### Suffix Rules
1. er, or, ly, y, consonant.
	+ 1st syllable
2. able, ary, cian, ely, graphy, ial, ian, ible, ic, ial, ics, ion, ity, ium, imum, logy, tal
	+ syllable before suffix
3. ee, ese, ique, oo, ette
	+ suffix itself
#### Compound Words
1. Noun
	+ 1st Part's stress syllable
2. Adjective
	+ 2nd Part's stress syllable
3. Phrasal Verb (verb + preposition , eg wornout, backup)
	+ 2nd part
4. Reflexive pronoun ( eg - myself)
	+ 2nd part

### Typesetting Stress
> preceeded by an apostrophe
