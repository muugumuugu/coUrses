In this question we have 3 polynomials, 
) and 
) and their degrees are given to be
2, 3 and 4 respectively. Which are the most suitable, although not necessarily exact
representation of 
) where 
) is a polynomial in 
and it is given
. So, what we need to do here is to identify the degree of the
numerator and the denominator.
Numerator degree 
) will give 2 + 3 = 5 that would be the degree of 
the degrees will add up and when we look at 
), then again the degrees will add
up which will give us 3 + 4 = 7, so this is from 
) and then 
) gives
2 + 4 = 6. This is 
) degree.
And in the denominator 
) anyway has degree of 2 and 
) we have seen has
degree of 5. So, since we are adding all these polynomials together, the degree of the entire
numerator is the maximum which is 7. So, we have 7 as a degree of the numerator and 5 as the
degree of the denominator. Since it is a division, the powers will have to subtract, so degree of
) = 7 
 5 = 2. So, 
) is a quadratic and that would indicate B and C are possibly the
curves because these look like quadratic curves. A and D are definitely straight lines.
