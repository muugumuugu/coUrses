In question number two, there is this polynomial, 3
 3 + 16
 10 and is divided by
another polynomial 
, then the remainder comes out to be 
. They are saying find
the value of 
 and 
. So, let us do the division, then, we have 3
 3 + 16
 10 and here
we have 
So, this gives us 3
 2 to start with and so this will be 3
 2 , so we should write it there,
 2 . And this goes off, and we get 
 3 + this becomes +. So, 16 + 3
 10. So, now we
have 
 coming up here, which gives us 
 3 + 8
, so +8
 and this goes off again.
So, we have 16+3
 10 . So, we again multiply by 16 plus 3p here, and that gives us
16+3
 2 . And there is no 
 term, we get minus 16
2 , then this of course cancelled again.
So, we are left with 
 10 + 16
2 , because this is being subtracted.
So, they are saying this remainder is
. And that is equal to 
 10 + 16
2 . So,
the 
 terms have to be the same here, which gives 
 = 1. And then c would be the negative of
10 + 16
 + 3
2 , which is equal to the negative of 
10 + 16 + 3. So, that is the negative of 9,
and so we get 
And that will indicate that none of the options are correct. So, this probably was supposed to be
 9. We observed that option A and option C are in fact the same thing. So, one of this was
probably supposed to be 
 9. Anyway, so our answer is that 
 = 1, and 
 = 9.
