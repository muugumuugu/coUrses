In this question, we have a company which is producing a product A through 3 processes and
the cost of production are given as 
) and 
). These are the 3 cost of
production. They have given us polynomials of 
. So, what is 
? x is the cost of raw material
per kilo. And now they are also giving us the waste management cost as 
) and
). What will be the effective manufacturing cost?
So, effective manufacturing cost simply has to be the sum of these. So, 
) = 
), so that is going to be so, 
1 is here, 
1 is here. So, 
1 would be 100
 3 and there is
 3 term in 
1 , so we first write down 100
 3 , then there is an 
 2 term here, 20
 2 , there is
also an 
 2 term here, 0.01. So, their sum will give us 20.01
 2 and then there is no 
 term in
1 . There is an 
 term here, so you get 
 0.008 
. So, this is also done. And then lastly we
have the constant term which is+ 10. So, this is the effective manufacturing cost for process 1.
Likewise, process 2 would be 
) + 
). So, here this is 
), this starts with an 
and 
2 also has an 
 4 term. So, we have 20.01
 4 plus there is no 
 3 term in 
2 , there is an
 3 term here, so there is no, this is not plus, we write 0.001
 3 , then the 
 2 term there is a 10
here and a 0.01
 2 here. So, + 10.001
 2 and lastly there is a constant term and no constant term
over there. So, this is 
20. So, this is the 
And then 
3 is going to be 
) + 
) and in 
3 there is just 2 terms, the 
 3 terms and a
constant. 
3 , there is only one term which is the 
 2 term. So, we just write all of them together,
 3 + 0.01
 2 + 20 . So, this is the effective manufacturing cost for the third process and the
three of them are given here.

Now, what is the ratio of effective manufacturing cost of first and third processes when the cost
of raw material per kg is rupees 1? So, basically we are looking for the ratio 
1 (1): 
3 (1) which
is then we just substitute 1 in the E1 term, so we get [100 + 20.01 
 0.008 + 10]: [1 + 0.01 +
20] is to, so we get 130.002 is to 21.01. So, we have to put this down as a number 130.002
divided by 21.01 is roughly 6.18762.
Then we have the third question, third part of this question which says, which asks which of
the processes M1, M2 and M3 should the company chose when the cost of raw material per kg
is 10? So, the company should chose the cheapest process. So, we have to find out 
1 (10),
2 (10) and 
3 (10). And then if we looked at that 
1 (10) =100
 3 is 1 lakh plus 20.01
 2 is
2001 
 0.08 + 10. This is then 102010.92.
Moving on then E2(10) is 200100. So, 
 4 = 04 so, this is what we get and this is 200100, so
 4 = 104 , so this is what we get and this is 200100. We see that the remaining smaller terms,
 3 , 
 2 and constant term have small coefficients as well, 0.001 and 10.001. So, they will not
really impact the value very much. So, we know that this is already larger than 
1 (10), so we
do not consider it.
Let us look at 
3 (10) which is then 1000 + 1 + 20, so this is just 1021 rupees. So, 
3 (10) is
the least which is why the company should chose the third process as their process when x is
equal to 10 rupees per kilo.
