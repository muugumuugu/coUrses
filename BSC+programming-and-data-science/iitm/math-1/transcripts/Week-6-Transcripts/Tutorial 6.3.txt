Now, we have this problem, which of the following polynomials should be added to the polynomial
) to make it divisible by 
 + 9. So, we need to recognize that it is not necessary that there is
only one polynomial that you add, because since it is only divisibility, we can add a number of
polynomials to 
) and make it divisible by 
 + 9. So, we have to check for each of these cases.
So let us see, or what we can additionally do is, we can look at the remainder that we get by
dividing 
) with this and then see what to do with that remainder. So, if we did the division,
now, we have 2
 3 + 23
 2 + 40
 and we are dividing it with 
 + 9. So, start with 2
 2 , so we get
 3 + 18
 2 . So, this cancels off, this gives us 5
 2 + 40
So, we do +5
 additionally, then we get 5
 2 + 45
, so negative and negative so we are left with
 and then that gives us a 
5 additionally here, so we have 
 45, therefore these two go
off and we are left with 45 as our remainder. So, 
) is essentially (
 + 9) into the quotient +45.
So, if we subtracted 45 from 
), we will get divisibility by (
 + 9).
So, B is necessarily correct. Let us look at what happens if we added A, if we added A, 
 2 + 9
 is some multiple of some product of (
 + 9), and some quadratic plus 2
 2 + 9
 + 45.
So, unless 2
 2 + 9
 + 45 is divisible by (
 + 9), 
) would not be divisible by (
 + 9).
So, what we should really be checking is 2
 2 + 9
 + 45. Is it divisible by (
 + 9)? And the direct
way to check it is to substitute 
 9, so you will get 2 
 81 + 9 
 9 + 45 = 162 
 81 +
45, which is greater than 0, it is not equal to 0. So, no, A does not give us divisibility by (
 + 9).
What happens if we added 5
, we get 5
 + 45. So, we have this 45 remainder, so we are getting
 + 45, which is equal to 5(
 + 9), which is directly divisible by (
 + 9). So, this is correct too,
c is also correct. And what happens if we added 
 126 , then we would get 
 126+45 as
the additional part upside from (
 + 9) into that quadratic, so this is equal to 
 81, which is
equal to (
 + 9 )(
 9). So, (
 + 9 ) is dividing this particular polynomial. So, we can add 
 126 also, and get divisibility by (
 + 9 ).
