Let us say, this example we have been given a function
to determine whether
and we are asked
has minimum or maximum values, if so what is the value and you
need to state the domain and range of . Let us first attempt the second question, what is a
domain? Domain of
is enter real line we do not have to worry, what is the range of ?
Let us take this function identify
. Since
, the function
opens up, if the function opens up then it will have a minimum value. So, the answer to first
question is whether
has minimum or maximum value, it has a minimum value, once it has a
minimum value it cannot have maximum value, if so what is the value?
You need to figure out what is the vertex of this particular parabola. So, what is the formula
for vertex of the parabola,
this is wrong, it should give me
, it should give me
but the graph is correct here where we are getting
, what do you get?
So, this
is wrong it, should be
which will give me minus 3. Sorry,
, which is written wrong here,
is the vertex. So, if you substitute
and therefore, the value of this is nothing but 0.
And obviously, the range if it has a minimum value, the range is minimum upwards, this is
the entire real line above this minimum. So, that is R intersected with
such that
. So, we have understood how to find the minimum and maximum values of a function, if
is negative you can similarly find the maximum value.

So, let us try to make this example more realistic. So, let us take 1 realistic example. Where a
tour bus in Chennai serves 500 customers per day, they charge rupees 40 per person. Now,
they want to revamp their strategies, so the owner of the bus service estimate that the
company would lose 10 passengers per day for each Rs 4 hike in the fare.
So, if they hike the fare by 4 rupees, then they will lose 10 customers per day, this is the
estimate. Now, the company wants to maximize the profit, so how much should be the fair in
order to maximize the income of the company is the question. So, let us try to answer this
question using our knowledge of quadratic equation.
So, let us say, 1 unit of hike is 4 rupees so let
denote the number of Rs 4 fare hikes. So,
what will this impact? This will impact the number of passengers because we are losing 10
passengers per fare hike. So, what will be the corresponding fair price for the passenger? It
will be
, 40 rupees is the fees that we are charging per person, the company charging
per person and if I hike the fare it will be four times , this will be charged per person.
Now, the number of passengers with this hike if you increase x units, that means, you will
lose 10 passengers every
units increase. That means
is the passengers that still
remain. So, in this case, the income of the company will be the number of passengers into the
fare, they have charged so that is
. If you open this, open the bracket
and multiply them, then you will get the expression to be
. This is
the income.
Now, the company wants to maximize the profit, first of all after getting this quadratic
equation, can you tell me is the maximum possible? The answer is yes, and why the answer is
yes, because it lies in the coefficients
. Because
and . So, what is here?
, a < 0 so, the curve will open downwards that means the
maximum is possible.
And what will be the maximum value attained then that is what we have to figure out. So
now, the next question is okay. So, where this maximum will be attained? The maximum is
possible, maximum will be attained on the vertex,
coordinate of the vertex will give me the
maximum. So, I will simply figure out what is the
coordinate of the vertex,
coordinate of
the vertex is point of intersection of the axis of symmetry, what is the axis of symmetry
, what is ? 1600, is 20,000 and
which will give me 20, so that is what 20 is yes. And of maximize
coordinate
the maximum fair that we will get is 36,000. Right now, how much we are earning, how
much the company is earning, it is 500 customers they are serving, where everybody is
paying 40 rupees so they are simply earning only 20,000 rupees that is when you do not
increase any fare
, you get 20,000. So, the main question is how much the fare should
Now, what we are suggesting here by solving this problem is there should be a 20 units of
hike of rupees 4 each that means, what we are suggesting is there should be 80 rupees hike in
the fare. So, the new fare for the company should be 40 plus four times
that
is 20. So,
and that is what is the recommended hike by the company. So, now every
person should be charged 120 rupees as opposed to 40 rupees and then the company will be
profitable and you may have to serve less customers. This is how we are using real life, we
are using quadratic equations to solve real life situations.

Now, let us go back to our linear functions, where we studied the slopes of the lines. What
was the slope of a line? Slope of a line was change in
by change in . Let us see what the
concept of slope has to do with a quadratic function. Let us try to analyse that. So, my goal in
this set of slides is given a quadratic function
where
, how to
determine the slope of a function .
So, in order to generalize this notion of slope of a function, we will first recall what we do
know about linear function. So, if you look at a linear function which is y which is equal to
, we know that this
considering a ratio of change in
represents the slope and
can be calculated by
upon change in .
We have spent a lot of time in understanding the slope and when I consider a linear function,
I also know that the slope remains constant okay. We also know that the slope is nothing but
of some inclination and that inclination is with positive
axis. I want to relate all these
concepts and try to figure out what is the slope of this quadratic function. Let us go ahead, we
will use a similar analogy for a quadratic function and define the slope of a quadratic
function. First let us take one example to discuss this concept of slope.

Let us take our standard prototype example. We are trying to answer this question,
