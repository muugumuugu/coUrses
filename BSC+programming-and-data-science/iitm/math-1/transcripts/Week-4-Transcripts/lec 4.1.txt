Quadratic functions
Welcome students, today we are going to start the new topic in our syllabus that is Quadratic
functions. Before starting this new topic, let us revise what we have studied so far. We started
with some simple geometric objects like points and lines, after studying points and lines
geometrically we plotted them on coordinate plane and seen how to derive the algebraic
equation of a geometric line.
When we have seen the algebraic equation of a geometric line, we got a form of the form
, it is also known as linear function that we have seen in last few lectures. And if
you recall recollect it from the first week where you have studied functions, this is
is a linear function.
Now, we want to enhance our knowledge further and add 1 more intrication or 1 more
complexity in this particular function and that is why we are studying quadratic function.
Here we will take an approach where we will first state the algebraic form and then derive its
geometric properties as opposed to what we did in straight lines. So, let us start with
quadratic functions.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:38)
The first question is, how will I define quadratic functions? The answer to this question is
given in this slide. So, a quadratic function is described by an equation of the form
, where
is a crucial condition. Why? If
it simply reduces to a linear
function. Let us talk about the name quadratic function. The name quadratic function is
derived from 1 foreign language where the quadra term, actual word quadratic term means
square and quadratic means related to square.
So, a quadratic function is a function that is related to square of the variable as can be seen
from the definition, it has a term containing a
. So, if
then it does not have a term
containing square so it no longer remains a quadratic function and it is a linear function
which is equivalent to a straight line as a geometric object.
So, we will put a condition that
that means we are studying a quadratic equation. The
next question is how to plot a graph of this function. So, this equation is actually composed of
3 terms, let us describe them 1 by 1 that is a
As I mentioned earlier, when
And finally, if you put
, the term
, this term is a quadratic term.
survives and that term
is a linear term.
, only term that survives is c so that is nothing but a constant
term. So, a quadratic equation can be split into 3 parts. If
is not there, then I know how to
handle this term on a coordinate plane, it just simply represents an equation of a non-vertical
line.
So, I know how to handle these terms. So, what if the a
term remains that is
? We can
graph this particular function and graph of any quadratic function will be called as parabola.
Graph of any quadratic function will be known as parabola. So, what are the important
features of parabola? In order to do that we first need to plot the parabola.
So, what is the best way to do it? We have already seen to graph any function what we need
to do is, we need to take the value of , put it in the formula
and evaluate it and get the
values of . So, consider all ordered pairs and plot them on the coordinate plane so that they
satisfy this function, is the best way to handle it. For example, let us take this let us take for
example, when
, let us take that particular function that is
In that case what I will do is, I will put
will take
I will get 1,
again I will get 4. So,
this is the curve
, I will get back 0. So, I will plot a point
I will get 1, and then
then I will get 4 and if I take
can be easily plotted by joining these points smoothly
, this is how we plot our quadratic function.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:35)
Let us take 1 example. Let us say I want to graph a function
. How will I
graph this function? In 3 steps. First, I will generate a table of ordered pairs satisfying the
given function. Second, I will plot those points on the coordinate plane. Once I plot those
points on the coordinate plane, I will connect a smooth curve joining the 2 points, this is the
recipe for drawing a function. Let us draw it here, for that I have computed some points you
can verify by yourself, if you put the value of
, you will get
and on
solving you will get 1.
You take the value
you will get 1, for x square you will get
and 1 in the constant
term. So, together they will cancel and you will get 0. Similarly, you can compute for
it is 1 and for
it is 4. Now, our job is to consider a coordinate plane and plot these
points so I have plotted these points.
So, these points are plotted and now I need to draw a graph, which is connecting all these
points. Now, here you remember I have plotted these 3 points, how will I know the shape of
this graph in this zone? That is a major question that you can ask, but this parabola is
somewhat symmetric in a sense, suppose I take this point, what is the point here, the point is
(1, 4).
Now, if I consider this point which is
where it takes the value 0 and consider the point 1 it
is 2 units apart. So, somewhere in this where
will come, which is 2 units apart from -1, the
value of the parabola will be again 4. I will keep the cursor here, see. So, there is some kind
of symmetry underlying this particular function, we need to understand that symmetry in a
better way.
So, what essentially is happening is, if I consider this point which is the bottom of the curve,
and if I draw a straight line, which is the line
every point there is a similar point on
, then if you look at all these points for
at the same distance from this particular point.
This also can be called as a symmetry of a parabola. We will study this later in the next slide.
So, right now, our job is to graph a function which we have plotted and let us explore further
properties of this parabola like this symmetry, what is the meaning of the symmetry and all
those things.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:00)
So, there are a few important observations, if you consider equation of
these are all parabolas, I have shown you two parabolas
both
parabolas have axis of symmetry. Inevitably all parabolas will have an axis of symmetry that
is, what is axis of symmetry. Let us go to the previous slide and see.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:28)
The axis of symmetry over here, as I mentioned was
fold along
. If I take this graph paper and
, then the curves that we have plotted here must exactly match each other
that gives us a recipe to draw a parabola.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:50)
So, all parabolas will have axis of symmetries that is if you take a graph paper containing the
parabola, and if you fold it along the axis of symmetry, the portions of the parabola on both
sides will exactly match with each other, this is the beauty of a parabola. So, now if I know
how the parabola appears on one side, I know how the parabola appears on the other side of
the axis of symmetry. It is a pure reflection of whatever is happening on one side.
Then, the point this axis of symmetry as we have seen in the previous graph, the point at
which this axis of symmetry meets parabola, we will call that point as a vertex of the
parabola. This is again a nomenclature we will call that point as a vertex of the parabola and
the point at which , if you put
, then the point at which the
called the value c or you can simply refer to the equation
coordinate is taken is
, put
, that will be
the y intercept which will be given by .
These 3 points play a crucial role in graphing the parabola. How? Let us do it one by one, Let
us say, our quadratic function is
where
, you can easily figure out that the
intercept of this point by putting the value 0 in .
Now, I want to know the axis of symmetry, this plays a crucial role. So, I will derive the
expression for axis of symmetry later but right now you memorize this equation as
this needs some algebraic skills which we do not have right now. So, I will derive it later. But
right now, you understand that
Remember, the equation of the quadratic function is given by
play any role in this and
will play a role. So, it is
where the graph meets this parabola, it is called vertex. So, the
obviously, because the axis of symmetry has
. So, the
, and
will not
is the axis of symmetry and
coordinate of the vertex is
coordinate of the vertex is
Let us see how this knowledge helps us in understanding how to draw a parabola. So, there
are 3 steps in drawing the parabola, first you need to generate a table of values, but if you
generate a table of values only on one side and you do not have a table of values on vertex,
then you may not be able to draw the parabola appropriately, that is way the knowledge of
these facts is important, so let us see how to draw a parabola by example.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:07)
, I want to graph this function. So, I will reiterate on previous points. So,
what is the
intercept,
intercept is 9, because if you put
, the y intercept is 9. Next, I
want to know the equation for axis of symmetry. So in this case, what is ,
, which will give me axis of symmetry to be
so I can evaluate the coordinate that is (
comes, you just substitute
is 8,
is 1, so
intercept is 9, axis of symmetry is
) will be the vertex. How this
over here in this expression, you will get the value to be equal
So, now with these 3 terms, how will I draw the function? So, now I know that around vertex
I need to find the points. So, based on this, I will draw a table. So, around
I have simply
taken three points, fourth point is already with me, (0, 9) is the 4th point. So, around the
around the point
I have taken the values so
substitute in the function
already known and
which is the value of
when you
. So, I have 3 points and the point
(0, 9).
So, I will plot these points on a graph paper, take a graph paper, plot the axis of symmetry
because around this the curve should be symmetric, take these 3 points, these 3 points are
here and I know (0, 9) is another point. So, it should be somewhere here (0, 9). Now, let us
plot a graph. So, now we have plotted a graph with much ease because of the knowledge of
axis of symmetry I know where the point where the minimum has occurred or the vertex
point is that is the beauty of axis of symmetry. So, this is how you will be able to plot any
function any quadratic function given to you, this is about the graphing of a function.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:48)
Let us try to see, is this the only shape that is possible that is the upward shape. Let us try to
figure out whether is this a quadratic function first of all,
. Now, in this case, let us try to figure out the 3 summaries that is what will be
intercept for this?
intercept will be 1, what will be the axis of symmetry for this
because b is 0, it does not matter what is the value of
, the answer is yes,
is the axis of symmetry that is
it will be 0.
axis is the axis of symmetry for this particular
function. And the vertex is (0, 1). In this case, we are not really getting much information
because what this is saying is (0, 1) is the
intercept that is (0, 1) is the coordinate, axis of
symmetry is 0 that means (0, 1) is the vertex as well, right?
But still this information will suffice because I know I have to find the points around 0. So,
let Figure out the points around 0;
, 0 and 1, these are the 3 points, their y coordinates
respectively are 0, 1, 0. Now you see there is a change, earlier we were only dealing with
positive side of
axis or the
axis where the curve is opening up, here the curve is opening
down. For example, if I plot an axis of symmetry over here, which is
axis and if I plot these
3 points, these 3 points look like this that means the curve will go downward. So, the curve is
opening down, why this has happened.
In earlier examples, if you look at it closely then this the form, general form of this
expression
, in all of them
was equal to 1, and in this particular expression
therefore, the curve is actually opening down instead of opening up, this point needs
to be noted.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:15)
So, let us know this point and figure out what happens when this
is greater than 0 or is less
than 0. So, that leads us to the next question that is maximum and minimum values. So, the
coordinate of the vertex of a given quadratic function is minimum or maximum value attained
by the function.
Do you all agree with this, we have seen 3 to 4 graphs of the functions, first we have seen
where it goes to bottom and 0 is the minimum value, then we have seen
which again gave us 0 value, then finally we have seen Third graph that we have seen the
last graph that is
, because the value of a was negative, it was going downward, and
that will give me the maximum value and all the values are below that value.
So, the
coordinate of the vertex of a given quadratic function gives us the minimum or
maximum value attained by the quadratic function. In particular, given any graph given any
function
where
. The graph of this quadratic function if a is greater
than 0 will open upwards and will have a minimum value.
If a is less than 0, the graph will open downwards and will have the maximum value and
there will be either maximum or minimum values, not both, this is the beauty of the quadratic
function. Another thing that you can see is the range of the quadratic function, if you relate to
your weak 1 background, where you are discussing about the domain-codomain range, so the
range of this quadratic function will be.
So, let us say a is greater than 0, then it attains the minimum value then it will be the
minimum value and all of the real line that is above the minimum value. And if a is less than
0, then it will be the maximum value and an entire real line which is below that particular
thing, I can denote this using the set theoretic notation as it is a set of real numbers R
intersected with a set of all
min when
, or if
, these
values such that
is greater than or equal to
it is set of real numbers intersected with
less than or equal to the maximum value that
has achieved.
So, let us try to visualize this. For example, if
particular the range of the value, range of
such that
your graph looks like this. So, in
values is from this point to upward. So, this is the
entire real line above this value. Similarly, if
, the range of the values that is taken by
this function is this, if you relate this to domain codomain terminology, what is the domain of
this quadratic function, it is an entire real name and range is restricted to some subset of real
life.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:51)
So, we will try to improve upon this concept using this example.
