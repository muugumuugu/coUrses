Logarithm Function: Properties -2
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
Now, we already know some facts, but it is better to revise them when we are actually handling
the problems. So, here is one such theorem that says that for a between 0 and 1, open interval 0
and 1 and for a > 1 and M and N > 0. So, these are essentially taking care of the conditions that we
are in the valid domain of logarithm.
Then, if M = N we know that log 
 = log 
. How this is derived? Because if you recollect we
have already proved that our function logarithmic function is one to one function that means for
every element in the domain there exists a single element in the co-domain or the range.
So, based on that you can actually see that if M = N log 
 = log 
. Then, another thing that we
want to see is two important values of logarithms. That is log, whenever we are talking about log
to the base a, this a is typically limited to or restricted to when we are solving any engineering
problem or any any stuff that involves some kind of engineering discipline, we generally restrict
to two numbers that are e that is Euler's constant, which we have mentioned and 10.
So, when whenever you are talking about these two numbers when you are talking about log 
we will give a notation ln and when we are talking about log to the base 10, we will give a notation
in log without any base. Why we are doing this? These two have special names also natural
logarithm and common logarithm. Now, this natural logarithm is as I already mentioned, it comes
naturally in the theory of calculus and therefore it has some special value and if you are using a
scientific calculator, then you will identify this natural logarithm as ln.
So, they are there are specific provisions given in scientific calculator because it is a natural
logarithm and then if you look at the scientific calculator you can open on your computer as well,
you will have some symbol of this kind, log this is log to the base 10 which represents our decimal
system. Because in decimal system, everything is given in powers of 10. So, therefore this is called
a common logarithm because we commonly used our decimal system and this is called a natural
logarithm.
So, these are the two important logarithms that we can study in the entire life. Now, the problem
that comes is why only these two why not others. So, here is my bold claim that only these two
logarithms will suffice for studying logarithms and why?
(Refer Slide Time: 03:53)
The answer to why is given by this particular theorem that is change of base rule. What let us,
understand, what does this rule says, this is also called another law of logarithms. So, if you are
handling x that is > 0 and if you are a is between 0 and 1 or if you are a is > 1. Remember this is a
base of a logarithm. So, I am talking about change of base. So, I will talk about another base which
is b, which is between 0 and 1 and b is > 1 this is called, this will be called as old base and this
will be called as new base.
Now, if I want all the calculations to be done with respect to new base. If I want all the calculations
to be done with respect to new base, then this theorem gives the answer, how should I go about
this. So, the answer is for any 
 > 0 you consider log to the base a of x then what do you do, choice
the new base that you want simply write the argument of the function over here in the numerator
and the base in the denominator and write logs with appropriate base that you prefer.
So, in particular if you give me if this theorem is valid, we will prove this theorem is valid if this
theorem is valid, then what we are actually talking about is you give me logarithm to any base, I
will convert that logarithm into logarithm to the base 10 or logarithm to the base e and I will
compute accordingly, that is the beauty of this theorem and therefore we have two important
logarithms. So, we will stick to only those two important logarithms one is to the base e which is
called natural logarithm. Another one is to the base 10, which is called common logarithm.
So, therefore, with this assumption, even our scientific calculators are designed to have only two
keys that are ln and log they do not generally talk about log to the any base. If you have advanced
scientific calculator, then it may talk about log to any base, but these two logarithms will suffice
in general. Because what you are actually talking about is simple change in the basis is just a
multiplication by a constant that log that constant will be given by this particular number, 1 upon
this particular number. So, let us go and start proving this result.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:51)
So, for proving it is very easy if you understand the basic logic in all these proofs for proving laws
of all laws of logarithm, what we are using is a key factor that is exponential function is inverse of
logarithmic function that is all. So, in particular if I want to prove this, let us say M = log 
 and
N =log 
, R = log 
So, what I am doing is I am mapping all these terms in terms of M, N so this particular term is N
and this particular term is R. Now, because it is this, you look at the other description of logarithmic
function. So, when you are talking about logarithmic function you are basically asking a question,
if I have been given a base a, to what power I should raise this base a so that I will get x this is the
question that we ask and answer to that question is given by M. So, essentially this means if I apply
an exponential function, which is a raise to M, 
 , then I should get back a raise to M = x this
is what I should get back.
And in a similar manner I will use this and I will I will use it for the second term and I will get
 = x and I will get 
 = a. So, now what is happening is, if your number is a can be written in
the form of 
 , if you are number a can be written in the form of 
 , then you can as well put this
particular thing into this expression, that means I can the write a raise to M as 
 = x that is
justified.
Now, what you have actually done you actually started with what. Let us, simplify this and this is
actually equal to 
 = x. Now, based on our understanding you simply hit this function with
log 
 = log 
, no confusion in this but this is actually inverse of this log function and is the
exponential unction.
So, I will get back RM= log 
. Let us, substitute what is R and M and then we will resolve. So,
this will happen if and only if, what is R? R is log 
 and this is log 
 is log to the base a of x
solve. Let me erase it and rewrite it again. Which = log 
. So, I am I have justified what I stated.
So, when I want to switch from log to the base a or log to the base b, it is simply a multiplication
by a constant that is log 
and therefore, our result is actually proved and what is what is our result
that my log 
 is actually log 
which goes in the numerator and log 
, which is a proportionality
constant comes in the denominator, that is all. So, now you forget about all other bases and you
simply try working with natural logarithm or common logarithm that is the key idea that we will
follow. So, let us use this fact and try to prove certain things like this.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:58)
For example. Now, if you have been asked some question like, what is log 5 89? So, you do not
have to go into much detail that what is log to the base 5? You can simply use natural logarithm
and use the change of base formula and get the answer to be
ln 89
ln 5
use your calculator it has a natural
key, which is ln, compute it you will get the answer to be equal to 2.78.
Somebody gives you any absurd number some irrational number log 
5. Still you do not have
to worry just apply ln 
5, ln 
2 change of base formula you will get ln
that is this thing is going
to the numerator argument is going to the numerator base is going to the denominator and you
know ln is nothing but natural base log with natural base. So, this will become 2.32 that is all. So
again, you can use scientific calculator and get the answer. So, this is how they were calculation
simplifies no matter what base is given to you, you can easily solve all the problems.
Now, sometimes people confuse with this kind of identity ln 
 they simply write it as ln 
, which
is not true. So, just this is just a warning that I want to give in particular. So, this identity is not at
all true. And therefore, you have to be careful while solving the problems. See in the verge of
solving the problems you made tend to do these kind of mistakes, which will ruin your entire
answer. So, in the next video, we will come up with better versions of graphing the logarithmic
function to any base using natural logs, or some other variations. Right now we will stop here.
