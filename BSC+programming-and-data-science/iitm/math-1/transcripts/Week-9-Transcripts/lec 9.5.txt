Logarithmic Functions: Applications
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
So, let us now go ahead and use these laws of logarithms and try to see some simple problems,
how the problems can be simplified using logs or how the problems can be made complicated
using logs.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:31)
So, let us see the first problem, it looks an ugly sum or ugly product and we have taken log and
how the process is simplified when you use the properties of logarithm that you have studied just
now or the laws of logarithm that you have studied just now. So, let us go ahead and do that.
So, this particular thing let me write this to be equal to, so first you identify or isolate the terms
that you identify can be separated. So, first term that I can separate out this is x cube, the second
term that I can separate out is this square root and the third term is numerator. So, essentially this
particular term if you look at can be split into 3 components, so I want end result that I want to get
after simplification should have 3 components.
So, first I will apply the quotient rule that is log 
 , so in this case this fetches me
log 
 3 . (
 2 + 1)2 
 log 
 + 3)4 . So, here I have not used any other rule so this is simply the
quotient rule that I have used that is the second rule that we have derived.
Let us go ahead, and see what we can do with the first term that is this term. So, now you can see
is simply see these terms can be characterize into two terms this is the first term and this is the
second term. So, I can write this particular thing aslog 
 3 + log 
 2 + 1)2 . So, to identify the
raise to half is inside the log I have put it this way then minus you look at this term again.
Now in this term something is raise to the power 4. Do I have any rule for indices of the law,
indices within the argument of logarithm? Yes, we have just now proved it for set of natural
numbers. So, you can use this that rule and say that this is equal to 
4log 
 + 3).
(Refer Slide Time: 3:20)
Let us go ahead and do a similar thing for the other two terms that are listed here then we will get
the final answer that is 3log 
 + 3). 3 times log to the base a of x plus half times here I am using
it for rational numbers which I have not proved 0.5log 
 2 + 1) 
 4log 
 + 3). So, this is how
I can simplify. Now in general, when you study logarithms people generally get confused between
the product becoming the sum. So, here we have some terms like this. Now these terms cannot be
handled with log.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:16)
So, right now let me give you a note of caution or a warning so to speak that is let me write this as
warning. Generally though it is obvious but while doing the calculation people used this rule;
log 
 log 
 + log 
. So, this is what people use and this try to solve the problem so
that they think they will simplify but remember this is not equal to that, why? Because we have
just now proved that this is nothing but log 
. So, these two things are different.
In a similar manner you can have a quotient rule that is log 
 log 
 log 
. Because
this is actually equal to log 
 . So, just remember this warning because generally in the when you
are in the fighting spirit you are trying to solve the problem you tend to make these mistakes and
which will ruin your entire answer. So, this is with extra star marked I am emphasizing that these
two are not equal.
Now let us try to see how we can simplify, sorry we have here seen how we can simplify our life
using logarithms where everything is now almost linear terms except for this quadratic term. Now
the next question that can be asked is can you combine using logs? The answer is yes, so if you do
not want to see such a big expression or you want to have a nice compact expression, the question
is can you combine? The answer is yes, and now let us handle the terms one by one and merge the
terms.
So, first term let us take these first two terms, what are these two terms? One is 2 log 
. So, you
have already seen log 
 log 
. Apply that in reverse so you will get this particular term as
log 
 2 , do not stop there you just apply the product rule now. 2log 
 + log 
 9can actually be
merged as we can use this rule and say this is equal to 9
 2 .
Now let us look at the next term which is this, next two terms in fact and there is negative sign so
naturally a quotient rule will come and you will have something like log 
 2 +1
. Can you combine
these two? Again apply the product rule and you will get this to be equal to log 
 2 (
 2 +1)
. So, this
is how you can simplify your life while studying logarithms by giving a combined expression.
So, you can use this to simplify your life give a long expression with positive signs when it will
help when you have lot of large numbers to be calculated. You can also combine the logarithmic
terms and combine the expression in a compact form when this will help when you have lot of
small-small terms that are unnecessarily occupying the space. So, when extremely large terms the
simplification will help when extremely small terms will come the matter will be simplified by
combining the terms. So, these are two simple avenues where you can actually do something.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:41)
So, I have already warned you about this log 
, this is nothing you cannot get anything out
of this, this is nothing. In a similar manner log 
 you cannot use reverse exponential or any
other form to get something out of this while solving the problems of logarithms. So, just whenever
these such terms come be aware and do not apply the things blindly.
