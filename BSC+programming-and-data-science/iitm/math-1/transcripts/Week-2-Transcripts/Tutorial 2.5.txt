Now 5th problem, Mary has subscribed to a cell phone plan with 400 free minutes, a 50 rupee
monthly fee and 20 paisa for every additional minute over 400. And the question is, what is
her bill amount if she uses 700 minutes?
(Refer Slide Time 00:42)
So let us put down our variables here. So there is 400 free minutes and there is a 50 rupee
charge per month and we have 20 paisa that is 0.2 rupees per minute over 400 minutes. Now,
our independent variable is the number of minutes, the bill is dependent on the number of
minutes, so our x variable is number of minutes and the y variable is bill amount. And what
we know is for every month the bill amount will always have a 50 rupee charge, and on top
of that you are being charged 0.2 for every minute over 400, which means if x is the total
number of minutes, then (x 
 400) (0.2) will be the charge for the additional minutes.
This is the fixed charge whereas this is the additional minutes charge, so we get a linear
equation which is y = 50 + x/5(because 0.2 is 1/5) - 80 which is then (x/5) - 30 . If we
simplify it further, we get 5y = x - 150 => x - 5y - 150 = 0. This is the equation that relates
our bill amount to the number of minutes. So, Mary is using 700 minutes per month and we
need the bill amount for that. So, if we substitute x = 700, we get, 700 - 5y - 150 = 0, this
gives us 5y = 550 which implies y = Rs. 110. This is the bill amount for Mary.
