Now the question can be asked that if a line is given to me, I can uniquely determine the
slope, but if a slope is given to me can I uniquely determine a line? That is the next question
that I will put up. In any sense the question asks can there be many lines with same slope?
The answer can be seen in this GIF image.
If you look at this image closely what we have done is? We have fixed one line and we know
how to compute the slope of this line we have a it will be minus 1 based on the coordinates.
Now, the blue line that is revolving around is actually having the same inclination as the
orange line.
Now, the orange line and blue line have the same inclination; that means, tan of those
inclinations will be same, will match and hence there can be infinitely many parallel lines
which have a same slope. So, the answer to this question, can slope of a line uniquely
determine a line? The answer is no, you cannot uniquely determine a line given the slope of a
line or the inclination of the line.
Now, why do we study the concept of slope or whatever we studied how it is helpful? The
helpfulness of this concept is just what we discussed in this graphical image, what we are
seeing is if the inclinations are same the line better be parallel. So, for parallel lines I can use
this concept and derive a condition of slope. Similarly, I can do by rotating them by 90
degrees; that means, I we can consider the perpendicular lines and I can consider general two
lines intersecting each other and see what condition I can derive based on the slope.
So, I want to explore the usefulness of slope. So, to explore this I will first figure out the
condition for parallel lines and I will figure out the condition for perpendicular lines, in due
course we will find the relation between slopes of two lines and their intersection and their
angles of intersection. This is what we will do in next few minutes.

So, let us go to the next characterization of parallel lines via slope. Now as you can see in this
image there are two parallel lines, they have same inclination, but they are not unique that is
what we figured out. So, if I play this video you can see again, this is similar to what we have
seen in the last video.
So, I have something which is moving around and there can be infinitely many lines, what
remains constant is the inclination, the inclination is same if I have parallel lines. So, let us
try to see whether we you can derive something. So, let to put it in a proper context.
Let orange line be l1and the blue line be l2 be two non-vertical lines. Why non-vertical lines?
Vertical lines have angle of 90 degrees for which the concept of slope is undefined,
inclination 90 degrees for which the concept of slope is undefined. So, what I need is nonvertical lines. So, considered two non-vertical lines with slopes m 1
m 2given the slopes their
inclinations 
and 
respectively.
Now, if you have been given that l1is parallel to l2then 
, inclinations are same that is
what we have seen in the figure and that is what we discussed in the last slide also. So, if
 then naturally tan 
 =tan 
 , once tan 
 =tan 
 ; what is tan 
 ? It is the slope of line11
that is m 1 and tan 
is the slope of line l2which is m 2. Therefore, clearly the slopes are equal,
m 1=m2.
The converse that is assumed that, if the slopes are equal thentan 
 =tan 
by a definition.
Now, tan 
 =tan 
does that imply 
 is equal to 
? In our case because we are restricting the
inclinations to vary from 0 to 180 degrees the value of tan is uniquely determined. And
therefore, because 
lie in 0 to 180 degrees 
 which resolves the problem; that means,
their inclinations are same. That means the two lines are parallel. So, l1 is parallel to l2.
So, what is a characterization of parallel lines? That means, if I want to say two non-vertical
lines l1 and l2 are parallel then it suffices to check whether their slopes are equal or not. If
they are parallel then the slopes better be equal and if the slopes are equal then we have
parallel lines. Now similar characterization we are searching for in perpendicular lines. So, let
us go and try to figure out this characterization for perpendicular lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:42)
Let us try to visualize, what are the perpendicular lines? So, here are two perpendicular lines
one l1and l2let us take the orange line as l1 and blue line as l2. So, l1 will have slope m 1, l2 will
have slope m 2 angle of inclination of l1 is 
 then inclination of 
, if it is perpendicular to line
l1is 90+ 
 which is 
 . And, then you may play with the tangent function of it and you can get
something which is very interesting.
So, let us try to figure out what is that interesting thing that we are getting. So, to put it
formally let l1 and l2 be two non-vertical lines because I cannot work with vertical lines 
equal to 90 degrees, the concept of slope is not defined which slopes m 1, m 2 inclinations 
and 
 respectively, no problem in this. If l1 is perpendicular to l2 as is the case in this a figure
I have 
 is equal to90+ 
So, if I want to figure out the relation between the slopes of 1 1 and l2 then it is a good idea to
take tangent of 
. So, let us take that. So, tan 
=tan(90+
 ) , but tan(90+ 
 ) if you use that
simple formula that is available to you is 
cot 
 which also can be written as
tan 
But what is tan 
? tan 
 is the slope of a line l2 which is m 2 and tan 
is the slope of a line l1
which is m 1. So, what we have just now derived is m 2=
or m 1 m2 =
1. That means, if you
take two slopes if you take slopes of two lines take a product of them and if you get the
quantity to be equal to 
1; that means, you have got a perpendicular line.
But right now, we have not proved that result, what we have proved just now is if l1 is
perpendicular to l2 then the product of the slopes better be -1. Now I want to prove if the
product of the slopes is -1 then the lines are perpendicular, how will I go about this? Exactly
the way we went for parallel lines.
So, m 1 m2 is
1 then I; obviously, tan 
 tan 
1; that means, tan 
will be equal to
tan 
tan 
cot 
but what is 
cot 
 ? tan(90+ 
 )or either it will be this way or it will be the
other way so, tan(90
). So, 
cot 
 is either tan(90+ 
 ) or tan(90
), in any case the
difference between 
 and 
 is 90 degrees.
Therefore, l1 is perpendicular to l2. Hence, we have proved a characterization that if two nonvertical lines are perpendicular to each other, the product of their slopes is equal to -1 which
can be written in this form. Two non-vertical lines l1 and l2 are perpendicular if and only if
m 1 m2 =
1 or you can verbally write product of their slopes is equal to - 1.
So, this is the characterization of the perpendicular lines via slope. So, what we have seen so
far is the characterization of parallel lines by slope and characterization of perpendicular lines
via slope, what if they are not parallel or perpendicular and they intersect just like that? If
they are not parallel then they better intersect each other.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:37)
So, in general if I want to have an intersection of two lines and I know the slopes of those two
lines. Can I talk about the angle of intersection of these two lines? The answer is yes. So, here
is the relation of angles between the two lines and their slopes. So, what I want to say if once
I show the figure it will be clear.
As of now let us understand I have two non-vertical lines with slopes m 1 and m 2, inclinations
 1and 
 2 respectively. And, l1 and l2 intersect each other, they are not parallel so they will
intersect somehow and they are not perpendicular also. So, they intersect in angles 
 and 
are the adjacent angles that are formed by l1 and l2, if they intersect in a perpendicular manner
the adjacent angles will be 90 degrees each. So, that is not an interesting case because we
have resolved that case.
So, now, if they intersect at any angle then this figure will look like this; let us first
understand this figure. So, there are two lines l1 and l2. So, l1 has angle of inclination
 1, l2 has
inclination 
 2 these two lines intersect over here near y coordinate 
and they have two
angles; one is 
, another one is 
So, these two angles are adjacent angles. What can you say about the angle 
 that is formed?
As you can see the angle 
 2 is obtuse and 
 1 is slight acute. So, the angle 
 is actually 
minus 
 1 provided 
 1 and 
 2are not equal to 90 degrees. Why? Because I cannot consider
vertical lines as simple as that. So, the angle is 90 not equal to 90 degrees, 
So, if I want to talk in terms of slopes of these lines, I better take tangent function and apply it
to the angle 
. So, let me do it. So tan 
=tan (
 1 ). Take a standard trigonometric formula
of tan(
 1), you will get
tan 
tan 
. But what is tan 
 2? tan 
 2is nothing but the slope
1+ tan 
 1 tan 
of line l2 which is m 2 and tan 
 1 it is slope of line l1 which is m 1.
Therefore, the answer to this is
. So, I know what is tan 
, now you can look at the
1+m 1 m2
angle 
 which is 180
. So, I can similarly derive a relationship for tan 
which is
tan(180
), we have already seen, this is 
tan 
 .So, that m 2
m1 will be swapped to m 1
denominator remains the same, the condition m 1 m2 
1remains the same because they
should not be perpendicular.
In this case we have figured out what is the relation of tan of that angle with respect to the
slopes of the lines. So, this finishes our discussion on two lines. Now another interesting
question that comes is, what if the three points are collinear, then how will the slopes be
interpreted? Imagine three points are collinear then what happens is their slopes must be
equal because they are all lying on the same line right and there is one common point.
So, if A, B, C are collinear slope of AB is equal to slope of BC and therefore, all of them
must be collinear. So, if there is any common point in between those three points the slopes
are equal, the points are collinear, that is called the relation of collinearity using slopes.
