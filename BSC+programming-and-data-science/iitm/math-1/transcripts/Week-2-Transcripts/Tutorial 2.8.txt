The 8th problem is pretty interesting. So, we have Sania who hears a sound in a night, and
she comes out to her balcony, which is at a height of 80 feet from the ground.
(Refer Slide Time 00:29)
So, let this be our tower, which has a height 80 feet. So, if we take this point to be origin (0,
0), Sania is here, which would be (0, 80). And she uses a torch light which makes angles 
and 
 with the ground, so the rays from the torch light make angles between these two.
So, this angle here, this is 
 and this angle here it is 
 . And the two thieves, their heights are
given and they are standing at these distances from the buildings. So, thief T1 is somewhere
here and T2 is here, what is given to us is this distance is 37.5. So, T1 is (37.5, 0), and this
distance is 50 feet, so this is 37.5 feet, this is 50 feet. So, T2 will be the point (50, 0). And we
are also given to understand that T1 is standing at a certain height, T2 is standing at a certain
height, which are roughly the same; one is 5 feet, the other is 5.3 feet.
In our diagram, we have drawn the rays of light as though they are passing away from the 2
thieves, however that we need to find out. So, if tan 
 is 2, and tan 
 is 16/9, can Sania see
any of the thieves ? so it is given to us that tan 
 = 2 whereas, tan 
 = 16/9.
So, that means we can find the slope of this line, which is the lowest ray of the torch, and this
line which is the farthest ray from the torch, and these slopes would be m1 =-2 and the minus
is because the standard angle here, which is angle from the posture x axis is actually 180 o - 
As you can see, it is clearly a line with the negative slope.
Likewise, this also is 180o - 
, thus this slope m2 = -16/9. In our diagram, we have drawn it as
though the 2 thieves are safe. But this is only a rough schematic diagram, we did not draw 
and 
 accurately. What we need to do now is to check if the line from Sania to the head of
thief 1 or the line from Sanya to the foot of thief 2. If these 2 lines have slopes between m1
and m2, then the 2 thieves are likely to be seen. So, we need to calculate these slopes, let us
call the head of thief 1 as H1 and that point will be (37.5, 5.3). So, slope of SH1 = (80-5.3)/
(0-37.5), which is -(74.7 / 37.5), which is roughly -1.992.
And slope of ST2, which is to the foot of thief 2 is (80 - 0) / (0 - 15), which is equal to -1.6.
So, I want to call this m3 and this is m4. And here m2 is roughly equal to -1.78. So, clearly m3
is greater than m1 and lesser than m2, but m4 is greater than m2 and also greater than m1 which
means m4 that is the foot of thief 2 is not visible to Sania, the actual light cone looks
something like this. So, thus we can say the head of thief 1 is visible whereas thief 2 is not
visible.
(Refer Slide Time 7:19)
And this light cone that we have drawn earlier it is wrong.
(Refer Slide Time 7:28)
Now, she moves her torch so that she can see the ground from a distance of 48 feet. Can she
see thieves or not?
(Refer Slide Time: 07:32)
That would mean she is able to see from some point here to some point beyond. From the
diagram, it is pretty clear that thief 2 is going to be visible, we do not know if thief 1 will be
visible though we have to check for thief 1's head. So, this point that we are talking about,
which is let us call it P gives us a slope with S as SP, the slope is equal to (80 - 0) / (0 - 48)
because point P is basically (48, 0).
So, that gives us - (80 / 48) which is divisible by 16, both of them are divisible by 16. This
would be 5 and this would be 3, so this is roughly -1.67. That would give us m3 is let us call
this now m5. m3 is lesser than m5. And that means the head of thief 1 is not visible now, but
thief 2 is visible.
