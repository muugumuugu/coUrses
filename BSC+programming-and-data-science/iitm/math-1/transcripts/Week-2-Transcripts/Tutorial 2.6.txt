For our 6th problem we have these 4 points given to us. Let us first plot them out on a graph.
(Refer Slide Time 00:32)
And this will be 0, we have a (-4, 4), so this is -1, this is -2, this is -3, this is -4, this is 1, 2, 3
and 4, so this point here is our K (-4, 4). And then we have (6.5, 6.5), this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
this here is 6.5 and 5, 6 and 7, this here is 6.5, here we are with L (6.5, 6.5), then we have a
(2, -2), -1, this is -2. So this point here is our M (2, -2). And lastly, we have (-5, -5), -4 and
-5, this is our point.
(Refer Slide Time 01:48)
Now we are told that R is the point of intersection of KM and LN, and it is known to cut the
line segment KM in this ratio, 4 is to 2 ratio, so let us identify R.
(Refer Slide Time 02:04)
So from our diagram, it appears to be the origin. Lets verify this, so we need this to be in the
ratio of 4:2. So when we use the section formula, which is the coordinates of a point cutting a
line segment in a ratio, m1 : m2 would be this, (m1x2 + m2x1) /(m1 + m2). And then we have
(m1y2 + m2y1) /(m1 + m2). So in this context, R is going to be ( (4(2) + 2 (-4))/ 6 , (4(-2) +
2(4))/6 ). And these 2 cancel out because it is 8 - 8, these two also cancel because -8 +8. So it
is true, R the point is the origin. Moving on then, we have two other points, P and Q given to
be (4, 0), (0, -7), so these are on the axis. So this point here is P(4, 0), and this is -6, this is -7
so this point here would become Q, which is (0, -7).
(Refer Slide Time 03:58)
Lets look at the options, RP and RQ are parallel, this is one option, lets verify. Now clearly,
this is 90
, PQ, PR is perpendicular to RQ and not parallel. So this is definitely wrong and
this is definitely right. Is there adequate information for finding the relation between RP and
RQ? Yes, we have just found the relation, so there has been adequate information.
Now let us look at 
 LRP +
 PRM. So we are interested in this angle plus 
 PRM. So this
sum is the total 
 LRM, so we need to know what is the angle between LR and RM. So let us
look at the slope of LR. So this slope if I call it m1, this is equal to (6.5 - 0) /(6.5 - 0), which is
1, which is basically tan 45
, so this angle here it is 45
And now let us look at this angle here, which is PRM. Then, if we look at the slope here,
which is m2 that is (-2 - 0)/(2 - 0), which is -1, which is equal to tan -45
, therefore this angle
here is -45
 because we are going clockwise from the horizontal. So in sum, we know that
 LRM is 45
+ 45
, leading us to see that this is 90
So this is true, which means the following statement is false, so this is false. And here we
have again adequate information for finding the relation between LRP and PRM. Clearly, we
have four options correct, so none of the above is not correct.
