Graphs of Polynomials: Identification and Characterization
Hello friends, in this video, we will take up our next mission of about understanding the
polynomials. This mission is given a graph of a function, whether we can identify the
given function is a polynomial or not. If you have been given a polynomial equation,
how will you put it on a graph paper?
So, the mission is twofold. First, If you have been given a graph of a function, you will
identify whether this function is a polynomial or not. If yes, the, we will answer the
second question that is can I derive the algebraic equation of this polynomial? The
second part of the mission is we want to identify how the graph looks like if I have the
equation of the polynomial. So, let us begin our journey about understanding the Graphs
of the Polynomials.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:17)
So, first of all let us recollect from our earlier experience that is linear functions and
quadratic functions. If I am as linear functions and quadratic functions themselves are
graphs of the functions. So, when I am plotting these two functions or when I am putting
them on the graph paper, what happens? There you will never feel any abrupt jerk while
drawing these functions. If you are trying to draw, you, for example, if you are trying to
draw a line, then what you will do is you will simply draw a line, and then on graph
paper. And there would not be any jerk for drawing the line.
In a similar manner if you are asked to plot a quadratic curve, you will find a axis of
symmetry, and around the axis of symmetry you will do something like this, this is let us
say this is the graph right, that means, the curve that you are trying to draw is has always
been smooth. So, that one feature we can record in our mind. And say that the, if I have
been given a polynomial function, the polynomial function must be smooth that means, I
should be able to join the points effortlessly without having any jerk.
If there is any corner or edge in the graph then it better not be a polynomial function.
Another thing is you can draw these graphs without lifting your pen; you can draw these
graphs without lifting your pen that means, these graphs always are continuous.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:04)
So, let us try to list these properties; first if you have polynomial of second degree or
higher even a linear degree, the graphs do not have sharp corners that is the graphs are
always smooth curves, this is a first feature that we will notice if I have been presented
with graph of a function.
Second thing is polynomial functions always display graphs that have no breaks that is
what I meant; the graph that I am drawing is always going to be continuous curve. Or
you can say in better words, it is curves with no breaks are called continuous, and
therefore the function itself will be continuous.
So, let us identify through two graphs. Let us have this graph. Now, is this a polynomial
function? Does it satisfy the first criteria? That is it should be a smooth curve, is it a
smooth curve? Yes, it is a smooth curve. But if you look at this point, then it had some
sharp corner over here, this corner is very sharp. And therefore, I cannot qualify this as
polynomial function; this is not a polynomial function.
Let us have a look at the next graph which is this. Now, here I can use my free hand skill
to draw a curve and I can actually find out how I can draw better curve. For example, if I
start drawing this curve, then I can easily pass through this. So, you will all the
transitions are very smooth, because the transition is very smooth I can easily identify
this to be a polynomial function.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:06)
Therefore, this qualifies to be a polynomial function, whereas this does not qualified to
be a polynomial function. Let us take a quick look at some other graphs and see whether
they will qualify as polynomial function or not.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:22)
So, let us go ahead. And pose a question, which of the graphs given below represent
polynomial functions? So, one by one I will unfold the graph, and we will argue for
whether they are polynomial functions or not. This is the first graph. As I mentioned
earlier, this also qualifies to be a polynomial function.
For example, if I want to draw a curve across this, I can easily draw a curve without
lifting my pen and therefore, it qualifies to be continuous, and it has no breaks in
between. So, therefore, it is continuous and it does not have any sharp edges, and the
graph seems to be free hand. Therefore, it qualifies to be a polynomial function. So, my
answer to this question is yes, this is a polynomial function ok.
Let us go ahead with the next graph ok. Now, what about this graph? Of course, we have
argued for say similar graph in the earlier page that this graph does not seem to be a very
neat graph, and it has a corner over here. This is the corner point of the graph. And
therefore, this disqualifies to be a polynomial function; this is not a polynomial function.
Again let me reiterate this was a valid polynomial function.
Next graph, let us look, let us try to see the next graph. This graph more or less seems to
be a graph of a line, because it is a graph of a line. You can see this is also smooth. The
transition is very smooth. So, again this will qualify as a polynomial function at least as
far as the graph is visible. This is a graph of a line and it is a linear polynomial. So, it
qualifies to be a polynomial function.
Let us go to the next graph ok. So, this graph is actually smooth. I can draw a curve over
here, but at this point let me erase this graph; actually, you do it here. At this point, at
this juncture, there is some problem. What is the problem? Over here, if I am drawing a
curve over here, then I have to lift my pen come to a point 0 and then start drawing it.
So, this defeats the criteria that the graph should be continuous. Though the curves are
very smooth, but at this point, this in this juncture, the problem is you cannot have a
drawing without lifting your pen. Therefore, this will disqualify to be a polynomial
function. This is not a polynomial function.
So, we have identified what is a polynomial function and what is not a polynomial
function. Generally, whenever you have several ups and downs in the functions, we will
estimate them or we will guess them to be a polynomial function if there is no corner as
given in this graph, second graph to be precise.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:15)
And if there is no there should not be any corner of this kind and there should not be any
discontinuity of this kind, ok. Then we can easily safely say that the given function is a
polynomial function ok.
And if you are looking at the ups and downs, these up and down of a function, those are
the typical features of polynomial functions. With this knowledge, we are ready to
handle polynomial functions because now, if you have been given a function on a graph
paper you can identify whether the given function is a polynomial function or not. The
next important criteria for about polynomial functions like quadratic equations is our
identity our ability to identify zeros; zeros of the function.
