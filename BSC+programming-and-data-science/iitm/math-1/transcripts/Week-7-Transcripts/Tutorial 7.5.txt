In this question, we are looking at an Electrocardiogram which is often called ECG or EKG. This
is a recording of electrical changes that occur in your heart during a cardiac cycle. So here we have
some ECG shown to us as a polynomial. And they are asking identify the number of turning points.
Ok? So that will be 1, this is 2, this is 3, 4, 5, 6, and here this is not a turning point, it is flattening
out like this and rising. Therefore it is not a turning point. We already have 1,2,3,4,5,6 so this is
7,8,9. That means we have 9 turning points. And then they are asking for the minimum sum of
multiplicities for that we look at the roots and so this one is directly cutting through this root is
directly cutting through the axis.
So the multiplicity of this is 1 and here this it is touching and coming back so it has to have an
even multiplicity. So the minimum is 2 and then here again this and this are both 1 each +1, this
1 also should be 1. And here we see this flat lined situation which occurs when you have an odd
multiplicity but not 1. So the minimum there would be 3 and then this is a 1 this is a 1 and this also
has to be 1.
So plus 1 + 1 + 1 which gives us all put together 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12. So the minimum
sum of multiplicities is 12. No electric activity that is flat lined surface ECG usually indicates the
death of a person. This is as shown in the figure after 
1 so after 
1 we presume that it is a, it is
basically along the 
 axis what polynomial will it be called for the domain after 
1 . Clearly a 0
polynomial. It is simply 
 is equal to a constant. So it has no degree and it is a 0 polynomial.
