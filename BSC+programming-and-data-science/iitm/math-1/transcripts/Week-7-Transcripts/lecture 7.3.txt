Graphs of Polynomials: Multiplicities
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, now, so far, we have mastered two skills; given a graph of a polynomial function, I
know whether the given function is I can identify whether the given function is a
polynomial function or not, ok. The second thing that we have seen is from algebraic
expression of polynomial function whether it is in factored form or non-factored form, I
have some set of rules or algorithm which will help me to identify, the roots of the
polynomial or the zeros of the polynomial.
So, with this knowledge, can I explicitly write a polynomial function, or do I need to know
something more about it? That is what the question that is troubling us. For example, the
knowledge about x-intercepts in this case, and the knowledge of y-intercept, is this helping
us to understand how the polynomial will look like?
For example, how will I decide the polynomial is going down from here, polynomial is
going up from here, and it will stay going up forever, or when will this kind of shape come,
the curve when will the rise and fall will happen, I do not know anything about this right
now. What I know is simply the function should be smooth, yes, this is a smooth function.
But, from this graph can I write this equation? Seems to be difficult right now, but we will
get the handle over it in due course of time.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:11)
So, let us now look at the x-intercepts or identifying the x-intercepts using graph. So, you
have been given a polynomial function. You have used a technology to identify the graph,
but still you are not convinced.
And, you want to try it by your hand. So, how will you do it? That is the question. So, if I
want to find the x-intercept, the given polynomial is a cubic polynomial, fine. So, this
polynomial is not given in a factored form; I cannot find greatest common factor that is
not possible.
Then, if I want to find something which is like binomial thing that is (
 + 4), but the rest
the other term is (
 6). So, I am not actually getting these two tricks done. So, there is
no way in which, I can factor this polynomial. So, one crude way, if you do not know how
to go about, is to plot the pair of values as we have done in quadratic case.
So, simply find out what are the function values at some points. So, these are some standard
points, I have drawn them symmetrically 0, 1, 2, -1, and - 2. When I considered these two
points, because the function is very nice, I accidentally came across two zeroes that are 2 and 1, good.
So, -2 and 1 are the x-intercepts of f which is clear from the table. Now, can I use this
knowledge to find the third zero? The answer is yes. And, we know the long division. So,
what you do is you consider (
 + 2) as one factor and (
 1) as another factor. You
multiply (
 + 2)(
 1) and treat that as a divisor, and take 
) as a dividend, and do
the long division.
If you do the long division; you will get, you may pause the video and try for yourself;
otherwise you will get the third 0 to be equal to 
 3; that is 
 + 3 is another factor.
And, this is a cubic polynomial, so it cannot have any other factor, can I have at most 3
roots. So, you got this (
 + 3), (
 + 2), and (
 1) as the factored form of this equation.
Then, it is easy to plot the equation along with this table of values.
So, what you will do is, you will simply put up the points, you will simply put up the point.
So, over here I know something and I know I have figured out the third root to be equal to
 3; therefore, I can put that point as well.
So, this is 
 3 and, how to draw a line passing through; so, the next step is joining the
line. So, you can draw join a smooth line passing through these points, then at this point it
will turn up; at this point it will turn up, but to connect to this point, it has to go down, and
then I do not have any idea. So, right now I can draw only up to this, right.
We will analyze further and see the cubic polynomial cannot turn more than two times, so
that we will that we will come later. But, right now I can draw it this way. So, let us see
what our graphical tool gives us. Yes, where the previous image and this image are slightly
perturb but they are exactly matching. So, this is how the behaviour of the function will
So, now we have slightly better edge over drawing the graph of a function, when we have
been given a equation of this form, but still I do not know why this is not turning up or
why this is not coming down, I need to understand these things in a better way by using
some analytical tools. For a moment, we got the correct graph.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:52)
So, let us move ahead and try to see the behaviour of the graphs around the intercepts. For
that, it is important to know the multiplicities of factor. So, in particular, graphs behave
differently for at various x-intercepts.
We can go back to the previous case, where everything is of linear order that is 
 + 3,
 + 2 and 
 + 1, the graph was behaving like this. If you go further back; why would this
graph behave like this? Over here, when 
3 is a factor, the graph the graph was
actually like a straight line and over here it turned around.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:33)
So, why should it turn around the factor? So, for example, 
 + 3 is one factor that is -3,
and here 
 1 is one factor. But, for this factor it turned around; and for this factor it
crossed, it cross the x-axis. So, why is this happening? So, I need to have a deep
understanding of this. For that, we will discuss the next that is what we will discuss in the
next slide. So, is it related to the function being appearing the factor appearing multiple
times? That is what we will try to see.
So, as mentioned as shown in the earlier slide, that the graph can cross over the horizontal
axis or it may bounce off; that means, it will touch and go up that is tangential to that axis.
So, why is this happening at x-intercept? That, so in that case let for that making the
understanding clear we will write a polynomial in a factored form which is
 1)2 (
 + 2)3 (
 + 4) , right. And, let us draw that polynomial using technology or
graphing tool, ok.
So, now some crucial things, let us identify the factors first; 
 1 that is 
 = 1, this is
the factor that we are talking about. Then, 
 2, this is the factor that we are talking
about and 
 + 4 this is the factor that we are talking about 
Now, at these points, what is happening, what exactly is happening at these points? So,
when I consider the factor (
 1)2 , because it is quadratic and if I recollect the graph of
a quadratic function, it behaved some it is not to the scale, but it behaved something like
this, right. It will never cross x-axis.
So, a similar feature is visible over here, when I consider the graph of this function. So, if
I consider a graph of this function, because 
 1 is coming twice; it is square (
 1)2
is there; so, what I am getting is the behaviour is of the quadratic nature, ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:39)
Now, let us look at that (
 + 2)3 . What is a graph of (
)3 ? A graph of (
)3 is somewhat
like this; it crosses x-axis y is equal to x cube, it crosses x-axis. So, now that behaviour is
evident when I consider that instead of x, I consider (
 + 2)3 that behaviour is evident
over here. It actually cuts and crosses x-axis.
And, if you look at the third factor that is 
 + 4 which is 
 4, it is behaving like a
straight line that is also. So, what is happening here? I have two things; one and this one.
So, in these both cases we have odd degree polynomials and, the odd degree polynomials
as we know actually cross x-axis. And, in this case I have an even degree polynomial
which is actually bouncing off the x-axis, this is a typical feature.
So, if I have even degree what we are saying is, if the polynomial is a, the factor is of even
degree, then it will bounce off; that means, it will not cross x-axis but, if the polynomial
as odd degree, then it will actually cross x-axis. So, these are the two typical features that
we will employ while for plotting the functions which are of polynomial nature once we
understand the factors.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:25)
So, in the next slide, I have given a general description of these factors, you can go through
these slides later, but it is essentially the same that I have said just now, ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:38)
So, now for identifying zeros and their multiplicity. What do I mean by multiplicity? How
often that factor is appearing. In the previous case the factor 1 was appearing twice, factor
minus 2 was appearing thrice, and other factor was appearing only ones. So, if I want to
identify the zeros and their multiplicities, I should look at the shapes of the curves. For
example, if you look at the first graph, here the degree of the polynomial 
 = 1, here
 = 2, 
 2 this is, and here 
 = 3.
As mentioned earlier, it is more; it is more evident now, that when I have odd degrees, the
curve actually passes through x-axis, when I have even degrees we can draw 
 4 , but
this will be slightly broad and it will cut the x-axis, it will be somewhat like this. Let us
not get into that. But, for odd degrees you will get something of this form, or even degrees
you will get the bouncing off pattern and for odd degrees you will get a pattern which is
actually crossing, one minute.
Let me reiterate this that; this is very as this is very important. If you have an odd degree
polynomial, then you are almost sure you are sure to cross x-axis. If you have even degree
polynomial, you will never cross x-axis at that point, you will simply bounce off from xaxis, ok. So, that gives us some more clarity. So, if the zeros of the polynomial or the factor
has even multiplicities, the graph will touch or is tangent to x-axis or zeros with odd
multiplicities, the graphs cross or intersect the x-axis.
Now, if you look at the even powers which are 4, 6 and 8, how will you guess, what is the
strength of the power? So, in that case the graph will still touch x-axis it will bounce off,
but which with each increasing even power it will appear to be flatter and flatter while
approaching the zero and leaving from the zero. For example, the base will broaden; in
this case, it will be something like this if it is 
 4 ; 
 6 further flattening.
If in a similar manner when you have odd powers like 5, 7 and then the graph will appear
to be more flat over here, and while leaving also it will leave slowly and then it will decay
at very fast rate. So, this is the typical feature from the bulge at these intervals you can
actually guess the multiplicity of a polynomial. That is the importance of this slide.
So, now we have added one more weapon in our arsenal that is we will identify the
multiplicities of the zeros. First we identify zeros. So, at the step zero is we identified given
a function where whether it is a polynomial function or not. Then, we identified the xintercept of the function that is zeros of the functions or roots of the functions.
After identifying roots of the functions, roots how many times repeated that is what, we
have identified here in this by using the graphical tools. This is quite powerful. And, you
can use it more often to understand the polynomial function. When you will actually solve
some problems on identifying the polynomial functions, you will get a better hold of it.
