In this problem, should be our fifth question. Suppose to find the area of ABC, there are three
points here. So, we need to make that triangle, our triangle would look something like this.
But to find the area, we are supposed to calculate a base and its corresponding height. So, we
are not supposed to use the formula which involves the three coordinates, instead, we will
take any of these sides to be the base. So, let me take AC to be the base. So, we need to find
the base length, which is AC, that would be by Euclidean distance formula,
 6)2 + (2 
 7)2 .
So, this comes out to be 
4 + 25. So, that gives us 
29 is the base. Now the altitude, the
height from B would be something like this, let us call this point D and this is 90 degrees, so
B to D that length would be the height. So, BD is going to be the distance of the point B from
the line AC, the shortest distance of point B, the line AC. So, for this we can use the distance
formula of a point from a straight line. However, we first need to find out the equation of AC.
For that, let us use the 2 point form because we have 2 points, we will get
2.5 . Anyway, if we cross multiply, we get 2y-14=5x-30, which gives us the equation to be
5x-2y-16=0 and the distance of (0,5) which is our B from this particular line. So, this line is
our 5x-2y-16=0 .
So, that distance can be calculated from the formula, which is the
|ax1 +by1 +c|
 2 +b2
. So here a is our 5,
b is -2 and c is -16. So, substituting and ( x1,y1 )is our coordinates of B, this is x1 and this is
y1, so the coordinates of B. So here we get
25+4
which then gives us
, | 
 26| is then
26. So, this would be the height.

Combining these two quantities, we get our area as half into base into height, which will then
be 2 
 AC 
 BD, which then gives us 2 
29 and 
29 cancels off, 2 cancels with 26
giving us 13. So, we get 13 square units as the area of our triangle ABC.
