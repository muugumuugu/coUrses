Equation of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines in General Form
(Refer Slide Time: 00:19)
Let us look at next example which is another application of a general form of equation of a line.
The example is stated in the form of a question that is if I have been given two lines
a1 x+b1 y +c1 =0, a2 x+b2 y+c2 =0, b1 , b2 
 0. What does this mean? That means the lines are
non-vertical. b1 ,b2 
 0 means the lines are non-vertical you can verify for yourself.
Now two such lines are parallel if a1 b2 =a2 b1and perpendicular if a1 a2 +b1 b2 =0. This is an
interesting application of general form of equation of line. And if you recollect, we have derived
some characterization of line in terms of slope. So, let us try to see this problem so let me first
identify if I want to characterize parallel and perpendicular lines what should I do?
What is a parallel line, how will I identify a parallel line when I will have their slopes to be equal
and how will I identify a perpendicular line, when the product of the slopes of the two lines is -1?
So, if you remember this then the job reduces to finding the slopes of the two lines. Can I find a
slope of these lines? Let us first consider this line a1 x+b1 y +c1 =0. You should be immediately
able to identify this with slope point form which is y=mx +c.
So if I want to adjust this equation in the form of y=mx +c then what should I do? Because b1 is
nonzero I can divide throughout by b1 and shift this coordinate of y to their right-hand side of the
equation. So, I will get y=
a1 c1
 . So what is the slope
. A similar trick you can apply
b1 b1
here and therefore you will get m 2=
m 1=
. So using slope intercept form you have got
m2 =
Now let us recollect the famous fact because b1 
b2 are not equal to 0 we are not considering
vertical lines. So, two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. So, what
you will do you will just put m 1=m2because you have been given that the lines are parallel. So if
you put m 1=m2 , minus sign will cancel each other
a1 a 2
= . Multiply both sides by b1 b2, b1 , b2 are
b1 b 2
nonzero.
So multiply both sides by b1 b2, you will get a1 b2 =a2 b1. Therefore, the lines are parallel then
a1 b2 =a2 b1. In a similar manner we also know something about perpendicular lines that the
product of their slopes is -1, if the lines are perpendicular. So, just multiply m 1 ,m 2 and equated to
-1. Minus sign will cancel each other so you will get
a1 a2
b1 b2
So take the denominator on the right hand side that is b1 b2, so a1 a2 =
b1 b2 which essentially
means a1 a2 +b1 b2 =0. Therefore, we have proved the result. So, now what we have done right
now is we have related our result about the characterization of perpendicular and parallel line via
slope to a general form of equation and this is the new condition that we are coming up with if
the lines are parallel and you have been given to two non -vertical lines and their general forms
then you just need to check that a1 b2 =a2 b1 for the lines to be parallel and a1 a2 +b1 b2 =0 for the
lines to be perpendicular. This you can consider as another characterization of parallel and
perpendicular lines using a general form of the equation of lines.
