Now, third question, you have two friends Lincoln and Lila who purchase shares of two
companies. Lincoln purchases six shares of a company M and one share of company N and
overall spends 400. This can be encapsulated as if the company M's share price is Pm and for
n that is Pn we can say that 6Pm + Pn = 400. Then for Lila there is four shares of Company
M and three shares of Company N coming to 360.
So, for Lila we have 4Pm + 3Pn = 360. How much did each of them spend on n? So, we need
to know what is Pn and 3Pn , that is what we are interested in. To find the values of Pm and
Pn we will require to solve these two linear equations. However, we only required to find Pn
because the question is only pertaining to the company N's shares. So, we can work towards
eliminating the Pm variable from these two equations.
So, we can multiply this equation by 4 and this one by 6 because 4 
 6 = 24, 6 
 4 = 24 and
that way we should be able to subtract 24 Pm . So, we are going to get from the first equation
24Pm + 4Pn = 1600, whereas, from the second equation we get 24Pm +18Pn = 2160. Now, if
we subtract second equation from the first we get these two canceling off and here we get
 14Pn = 560.
And this indicates that Pn = 560 / 14 because we can cancel out the plus and the plus and that
is equal to 40. So, Pn is 40 rupees per share. And now since Lincoln has purchased only one
share, Lincoln spent only 40 rupees on company N, whereas, Lila spent three times that
which is rupees 120.
