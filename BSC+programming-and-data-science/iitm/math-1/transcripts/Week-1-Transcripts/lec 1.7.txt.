So, closely related to relations are functions. So, what is the function? A function is a rule
that tells us how to convert an input into an output. So, for instance suppose we want a
function that given an x returns as x2, then this is one way to write the rule. We write this
symbol which says x maps to x2; given an x it is transformed to x2, but more conventionally
we also give a name to the function. So, in this case we can call it square(x).
So, square(x) takes a parameter x as input and it produces as output; some value which
transforms this parameter, in this case x2.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:56)
So, we can plot x versus x2 by putting all the points where the second coordinate is the
function value of the first coordinate. So, if we look at x2 for instance, it forms this up you
know inverted parabola shape which you should be familiar with. And notice that because for
instance 22 is the same as (-2)2, there is a symmetry about the y axis.
So, for instance 22 is the same as (-2)2, and 32 would be the same as (-3)2 and so on.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:31)
So, when we define a function, we have to be careful about specifying what set we take the
input from and what sets the output produces. So, the input set is called the domain. So, for
instance the domain of square as we have defined it above is a set of reals, so we can take the
square of any real number.
Now the output when we apply square, we know that it is going to be a real number; so the
codomain as it is called is the output set of possible values is called the codomain, in this case
is the reals. But of course, we know that when we square a number; even if the input is
negative, the output is going to be positive. So, even though the codomain is a set of all reals,
we cannot get all reals as output of the square function. So, there is a separate name for that
called the range.
So, the range of a function is a subset of the codomain; the range tells us what values the
function can actually take. So, in this case the range of the square function is the non-negative
reals. So, this is all real numbers greater than equal to 0 which is sometimes written like this
and if you want to explicitly write it out; it is the set of all r in the set of reals such that r >= 0.
So, in order to specify a function abstractly and describe its domain and codomain, we
usually write that f which is the name that we give to an arbitrary function is a function from
X the domain to Y the codomain. So, this notation f : X to Y tells us without telling us what
the function is actually doing; it tells us on what sets it operates, what is the input set and
what is the output set.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:08)
So, the close connection between functions and relations is that we can associate with every
function f a relation R f ; and R f is merely all the pairs of inputs and outputs that the function
allows. So, for example, with our square functions sq we have R sq as all pairs (x,y), such that
y is equal to x2.
So, this is actually sometimes simplified by saying y is equal to x2. So, we do not write out
f(x) and then say f(x) is y; we just directly say y is equal to x2 to denote that the output is the
square of the input. So, this is an implicit notation, where we are implicitly naming the output
for each x as y. So, notice that if we talk about it as a relation; remember that a relation is a
subset of the Cartesian product of two sets. So, in this case, the Cartesian product is formed
by the domain of the function and the range of the function, and then the relation is a subset
of the domain X the range.
So, what are some properties of this relation? Well, first of all when we define the domain of
a function, we really mean that the function is defined at every possible value in that domain.
So, for every x and domain of the function f, there must be a valid value f(x); so there must
be a y such that (x, y) belongs to the relation R f . The other property is that this is a rule for
producing an output from an input; so there can be no confusion about what the output is.
So, for each x that we feed in as a domain value to the function, there must be as exactly one
output value f(x) that we get out. So, there is only one y in the codomain, such that (x,y)
belongs to R f . And in fact, we saw in the lecture on relations that, we would draw relations
by plotting the points which form part of the relation. So, technically when we are drawing a
graph of a function as we have done here for this parabola, we are actually drawing all the
points which satisfy the relation R f .
So, plotting a graph is the same for functions and relations; because implicitly we are plotting
the relation that corresponds to a given function.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:23)
So, let us look at some other functions that we will encounter as we go along. So, if we have
a function of the form something x + something. So, mx + c, then this defines a line. So, then
the like we see a line 3.5x + 5.7. And what we will see as we go along in this course is that,
the quantity which multiplies x is called the slope and it determines the angle at which the
line goes; and the other quantity which is without x determines the intercept.
So, notice that if you set x = 0, then the first term goes to 0; this gets cancelled out, if x is 0.
So, the answer will be 5.7. So, when x is 0, you get 5.7. So, what the second term tells us is
where this line crosses the y axis.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:09)
So, if we change these two values, we get different lines. So, for instance if we change the
intercept and keep the slope the same; then we get a line which has the same slope it is
parallel, it is at the same angle. But now the intercept is -1.2; so it crosses the y axis lower, so
the whole line is shifted to the right.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:28)
On the other hand if we keep the intercept the same; but we change the slope, we get a
different slanted line. So, here we have reduced the slope from 3.5 to 2; so it is a shallower
line and the green line passes through exactly the same point 5.7 as the previous one, but it
has a shallower slope.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:49)
And we can change both and in fact, we can put a negative slope; so if you have a negative
slope, it comes down rather than going up, so we have this line coming here. And notice that
it crosses at 2.5, so that is the intercept. So, by changing the values of the slope and the
intercept, we get many different lines and many different functions.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:07)
And for all of these functions that we have defined the domain is the set of reals, the
codomain is the set of reals; but also because we can intuitively see that the line goes from
way down -
 to way up +
 whether it is going up or down, it can take all values in the real.
So, not only is the codomain equal to R, it is also the range.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:28)
So, here is another function x maps to 
x. The first question is, is this a function? So,
remember that for a function, we need it to be defined on every input value and we also
needed to have a unique output. So, remember that when we square a negative number, we
get the same as when we square the positive version; so 52 and (-5)2 are both 25.
So, technically if we take 
25, we cannot determine whether we are talking about +5 or -5.
So, when we write 
x as a function, our convention is that we are taking the positive square
root. So, the function on the right plots the positive square root; if we were to take the
negative square root, then it would be a symmetric curve going below. And now if we take
both these together, then this is not a function; because if we take any x value, we have two
possible outputs for this which is not allowed. So, we are taking by convention the positive
square root.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:23)
Now what is the domain of this function? Well it depends on what we allow the codomain to
be. We have seen that negative numbers cannot have real square roots; no real number can
multiply itself to produce a negative number, because of the law of signs for multiplication.
So, if we insist that the output should be a real number, then the domain of this function, the
function can only be defined when the input is not negative. So, we have this set which we
defined before; the set of reals bigger than or equal to 0.
On the other hand, if we move to the set of complex numbers which we said we are not going
to describe in detail; the set of complex numbers includes 
-1 and implicitly through that the
square root of all negative numbers. So, once we allow complex numbers as the output of our
function, then we can define square root on all the real numbers.
So, the notion of domain and range is kind of flexible depending on how we are going to use
the function. So, we have to be very clear when we are using a function what context we are
using it in.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:24)
Now we saw when we looked at relations that there are some properties of relations which
are interesting like reflexivity, symmetry and so on. Similarly there are properties of
functions which are interesting; the first interesting property of function is whether it is one to
one, whether it is injective.
What this means is; if I give you different inputs, does the function always produce different
outputs? If x 1
 x2 , is it guaranteed that f( x
 f( x
? So, if we look at the linear
function that we saw before the line, then we can see that it is injective; because if we change
x, we move along the line to a new point. So, no two x points, point to the same y point; so
therefore, this is an injective function.
If on the other hand, we take a parabola as function which of the other form something
squared, so 7 x2 for instance. Then we already saw that f(a) is the same as f (-a), so there will
be two points; the plus version and the minus version, both of which has the same output. So,
it is not the case that distinct outputs produce distinct, inputs produce distinct outputs; so the
square function is not injective.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:32)
On the other side we talked about the distinction between the codomain and the range; we
said that the codomain is the set of values into which the function produces answers, but the
range is the actual set of values of the functions can take.
So, the question is, whether or not all values in the codomain are actually touched by the
function and this is called surjectivity or onto. So, the range of a surjective function is in fact
equal to the codomain, which says that for every y which is in the possible codomain of f;
there is actually an x in the domain of f, such that f (x) = y.
Now, once again if we take a line, then this is surjective; because if I pick any point y, I can
find a point x, I can solve for x for example, which gives me that y. On the other hand if I
take a parabola, in this case we have shifted the parabola up, so it is 5 x2 +3 . Then we can see
that, first of all a parabola with no shifted, if I did not have this +3 term; then we know that it
can only take positive values, because x2 will always be a non-negative number.
Now if I further add +3, it can only take values 3 and above; so this definitely is not
surjective, the domain codomain is a set of all reals, but the actual range is only if the reals
which are bigger than or equal to 3. Similarly if I take this 7 
function, then we know that
even if we take the codomain to be R; so we only take square roots of positive numbers. We
know that we will never get a negative answer, because by convention we have taken positive
square roots.
So, this is again not a surjective function. So, these are two important properties of functions,
are they injective is it one is to one; if I give you different inputs, do I get different outputs
and is it surjective, is it onto, does every possible output have a corresponding input that
maps to it.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:25)
So, if you combine these two, you get something called a bijective function. So, a bijective
function is something with where there is a one to one correspondence between the domain
and the codomain.
So, every x in the domain maps to a distinct y in the codomain and every y in the codomain
has a unique x that maps to it. So, from the statement it looks clear that this corresponds to
injectivity and surjectivity. So, actually this is the theorem that a function is bijectuve if and
only if it is both injective and surjective.
Now this may look obvious, but actually only one direction is obvious, from the definition,
we can see that if a function is bijective; it must be injective, because it says every x maps to
a distinct y, so no two x will map to the same y.
It also says it is surjective, because it says every y in the codomain has a unique pre image.
So, the fact that a bijection implies injectivity and surjectivity is part of the definition; the
other way requires a small argument. So, supposing a function is injective and surjective, we
have to show that it is bijective. So, for this, we have to guarantee first that every x maps to
unique y; but this is guaranteed because the function is injective, injectivity says if I have two
inputs x 1and x2 which are not the same, f ( x1 
 f ( x2 
 . So, this is fine.
What about surjectivity? So, surjectivity says that everything in the output comes from some
input not necessarily unique; but if two things map to the same output right, if two things map
to the same output, if I have a y such that I have x 1and x2 mapping to the same y. So, if it has
even, if a surjective function if the output has two pre images; then these two pre images do
not satisfy injectivity. So, if I combine surjectivity in the presence of injectivity, I know that
the pre image is unique; and therefore these two conditions guarantee that I have a bijection.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:15)
So, an important use of bijection is to count the items in a set. So, remember we said that the
cardinality of a set is the number of items and if you have a finite set, we can count them.
Now supposing somebody gives you two large sacks filled with marbles or balls and ask you
to check whether the two sacks have the same number of balls each. So, think of these sacks
as sets and these balls are a large number of elements.
Now, you could of course, count the marbles in each sack, but this is a bit tedious; because
we know that as we are keeping track of these small objects, we often lose count or miss
count or add one or plus one. So, at the end, we have to be doubly sure that we have counted
correctly, so we will count it a number of times. So, counting the marbles in each sack and
then checking if the two counts are equal is a tedious process and it is error prone, if we do it
manually.
Now, here is a manual process which is less error prone. Supposing we put our hand into
each sack and pull out a marble from each sack and put it away somewhere; then we put our
hands again in and take out one marble each again and put it away somewhere. So, with each
move, we are taking out one marble from each sack. So, what can we say; well if the two
marbles sacks get empty together, then we pulled out one from each. So, we have actually
established that there is a one to one correspondence between the marbles in the first sack and
the marble in the second sack.
If on the other hand when we find one sack is empty and the other sack is not empty; this
means that up to this point, we pulled out an equal number of marbles from both sacks and
now one sack has extra marble, so they were not equal. So, in this way establishing a
bijection is equivalent to saying that two sets have the same cardinality. So, for finite sets this
is a convenience; but for infinite sets this is the only way in order to establish that the
cardinality is the same.
So, for instance supposing we want to know whether the number of lines that we can draw is
the same as the number of points on this plane R X R . So, R X R is a set of all points that
you can draw on this plane and the number of lines we can draw is a number of such straight
lines that we can draw; are these the same? Now it may not seem obvious how to argue this
one way or another; but remember that we said that every line can be represented by a
function of the form mx + c. And we also said that if you change m, you get a new line and if
you change c, you get a new line. So, m and c together uniquely define a line.
So, since m and c together uniquely define line; every pair (m, c) defines a line and every line
defines a pair (m, c), so there is a one to one bijection between the lines and the pairs of
points on this plane. So, actually the number of lines is the same as R X R. So, think about it,
because this may not be obvious at first sight; but by establishing a bijection in this way, we
can say that the number of lines that we can draw on a plane are equal to the number of points
on a plane.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:09)
Now, suppose we extend this argument; if we take any two points right, if we take two points
say x 1and x2 , we can draw a unique line passing through these points. So, this is a well known
fact from geometry.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:23)
So, we know that the number of lines has the same cardinality as R X R that is what we
claimed in the previous argument. Now we say that every pair of points defines a line. So,
can we say that every pair of points therefore, has the same cardinality? So, remember this is
a pair of points.
So, we have one point here and one point here. So, do we say that every pair of points has the
same cardinality as the set of all points? So, it is R 2X R 2 the same as R XR, is this an
argument for that? So, important thing is to ensure that we have a bijection; the problem is
that this is not a bijection, because along any line we have many points, right.
So, if I take these two points, indeed it forms a unique line; but I get the same line if I take
these two points for instance. So, it is not the case that every pair of points that I pick
generates a different line. So, unless I can show you that pairs of points, different pairs of
points generate different lines; I do not get a one is to one correspondence between pairs of
points and lines, and therefore this bijection breaks down.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:24)
So, whenever we are trying to use a bijection to describe some kind of a correspondence and
count points especially in an infinite set, count elements of an infinite set, compare infinite
sets against each other; you must make sure that the function you are defining is really a
bijection.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:39)
So, to summarize a function gives us a rule to map inputs to outputs. And with each function
we have to specify three sets; we have to specify the domain, so the function must be defined
on every set in the element of the domain set, the codomain what are the output elements
supposed to look like and the range which was actually the output assumed by the function
once we applied.
So, not all elements in a codomain may actually be attainable by the function; the range is
those elements which you can reach through the function. With each function we can
associate a binary relation consisting of all pairs (x , y), such that y = f (x). Then we saw
some interesting properties that we would like to prove for functions in order to make use of
them; one is injectivity that is every pair of distinct inputs produces distinct outputs, so this is
one is to one. And surjectivity which says actually that the codomain and the range match;
everything that I could possibly generate, can in fact be generated by applying the function.
Then we saw that a bijection combines these two. So, a bijection gives us something which is
an injection and a surjection; something that is one to one and onto. And once we have a
bijection between two sets, we can actually argue that the two sets have the same cardinality
and this is often the only way to prove that two infinite sets have the same cardinality.
Thank you.
