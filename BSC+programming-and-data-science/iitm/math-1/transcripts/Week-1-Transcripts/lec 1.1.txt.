So, welcome to the 1st week of Mathematics 1 for Data Science. So, we are going to start
with some very basic things which you probably know; right from the beginning we are
going to start talking about numbers. So, in this 1st module what we are going to talk about is
natural numbers and integers.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:30)
So, as you probably remember from as young as you were in school when you first came
across numbers, we use numbers mainly for counting. So, for instance if we see 7 balls like
this and then we see 7 pencils like this, then we need to know that these are the same number
of things and for this we use this number 7. So, 7 represents what is common to these two
objects that there are 7 balls and 7 pencils. So, 7 is an abstract concept in that sense and it
refers to a quantity.
So, we all of course, know the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and all that. So, when we see a number of
things, we can count them. But perhaps the most important number of all which is of Indian
origin is 0. So, it is quite important to have a way to represent something when there is
nothing to count because without a 0, we cannot use our place numbering system that we use
to manipulate numbers.
So, these numbers starting with 0 are what are often called the natural numbers. Now there is
some confusion in some books and many books will actually use only 1, 2, 3, 4 to represent
the natural numbers. So, we use N to represent the set of natural numbers and in case there is
any confusion whether 0 is included in this set or not, now sometimes people will not include
0 in the set of natural numbers.
So, sometimes to emphasize that we are using 0, we will actually put the subscript 0 below
the N right. So, we will write either N or N 0, but whenever we are talking about natural
numbers, it always includes a 0. Now what can we do with natural numbers? Well we can
add them, we can subtract them, we can multiply them, we can divide them. So, these are the
normal arithmetic operations which you have studied in school.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:43)
But what is really interesting from a mathematics perspective is, when we take natural
numbers and we perform an operation on them, do we always get a natural number? So, if we
add two natural numbers, do we get a natural number? If we subtract a number from another,
we get a natural number? If we multiply them, do we get a natural number? If we divide one
by another, do we get a natural number?
So, the first operation which fails this test is subtraction because if we subtract a larger
number from a smaller number, so supposing we take 6 and subtract it from 5; then we go
below 0 right. If you have 5 things and we take away 6 things, we will be cannot take away 6
things that is what subtraction means. So, we need to expand the scope of our numbers to
allow these operations to work sensibly and this is how we get the negative numbers.
So, we had the positive numbers 0, 1, 2 the non-negative technically because 0 is neither
positive nor negative. So, we had the positive numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. We added a 0 to account for
the fact that we are counting nothing and now we add symmetrically on the other side
negative numbers -1, -2, -3. So, this is just to illustrate why we get them of course, this is
something that you should know from school.
So, this set which is the natural numbers extended with a negative numbers is what we call
the integers and we use Z to indicate the set of integers. So, we have N the set of natural
numbers which starts at 0 and goes forward 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and we have the integers which start
at no at minus infinity and go to plus infinity. So, these are both infinite sets, but the natural
numbers have a starting point 0 and the integers extend to infinity in both directions.
So, it is very convenient mentally to think of the integers as forming this kind of a sequence
where on the left you have the very small ones and on the right you have the very long ones
and this is normally called the number line. So, as you go from left to right, the numbers are
increasing and this is how the integers are arranged.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:27)
So, we said that subtraction takes us away from natural numbers and we brought the integers.
So, now, let us look at the other two operations that we talked about multiplication and
division. So, let us start with multiplication. So, when we say 7 
 4 what we are really saying
is take 7 objects and make 4 copies of them. So, for instance on the right, we have those 7
balls that we started with and then we have made 4 copies of them. So, if we want to know
how many balls are here, then we have 7 from the first group, 7 from the second group and so
on. So, we have 4 groups of 7 and this is if we add it up going to be 28.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:02)
So, in general this is how we multiply when we take a number m and multiply it by n, what
we are doing is we are making n copies of m. So, we are taking m + m + m
 n times. So, in
this sense multiplication is repeated addition.
So, we often use this time sign the 
 sign for multiplication, but this is often cumbersome
when we write out equations. So, sometimes we replace this time sign by a . and sometimes
we write nothing at all. So, if we just write two symbols together, we do not write this
normally for numbers because imagine that if I write 7 4 like this, then you do not know
whether it is a number 74 or its 7 
 4. So, if we have numbers, we will normally write a dot
explicitly between them like 7 
 3. But when we have a names like m or n standing for
numbers, then if we write mn; we assume that it is one number m multiplied by another
number n.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:56)
Now, we have integers, an integers have signs they are positive and negative numbers. So, we
have to remember that when we multiply numbers with signs, the resulting number also has a
sign and there is a sign rule which basically says that if we have one negative number
multiplied by one positive number, then the result is a negative number. So, let us assume
that m is a positive number so, - m is a negative number. So, say - 7 
 4 would be - 28. On
the other hand if I take (- 7) 
 (- 4), then the two negations will cancel, and I will get 28.
So, if you have an even number of minus signs, you get a positive number; if you have an
odd number of minus signs, you get a negative number.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:40)
Now just like we have repeated addition, we can also do repeated multiplication. So, instead
of doing m plus m, we can takes m times m and this is called m squared and the reason that it
is called m squared is visible in the picture here. So, we have now here 6 balls and 6 balls. So,
we have 6 
 6 right. So, this means that we can arrange these 6 times 6 balls in a square and
this is why we call this square.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:15)
So, this notation m 2stands to the fact that, m is multiplied by itself twice. Now if you
multiply it by self 3 times, then we get a cube. So, here for instance we have 3 balls by 3 balls
and then we have a height a stack of 3 such balls. So, we have a square of 3 by 3, 9 balls and
we have 3 stacks of these one on top of the other. So, this naturally forms a cube so, m 
m is written m 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:37)
Now, unfortunately we live in a 3-dimensional world and we cannot imagine objects which
have more than 3 dimensions. So, our vocabulary stops with cube. So, in general if we have
m , then we write m 
, k times and we just say it is m , we do not have a fancy name
for it. We just say it is the kth power of m ok. So, to emphasize multiplication is repeated
addition and exponentiation as we have seen is repeated multiplication.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:07)
So, now let us come to division. So, you would have seen this familiar problem in school.
You have a certain number of objects and you want to divide them among certain number of
people. So, for example, supposing you have 20 mangoes and you want to give them to 5
friends. So, how many mangoes does each friend get?
(Refer Slide Time: 08:31)
So, here on the right we have this picture and then, what you do is well you start by
distributing one mango to each friend right. So, you take out 5 mangoes and you give them to
each of your friends. So, now, you have given away 5 mangoes and you have only 15
mangoes left so, you repeat the process. Among the 15 mangoes, you give away 5 to your
friends one each and now your 15 mangoes have become 10 and do it one more time and
your 10 mangoes have become 5, do it a third time or fourth time rather and the 5 mangoes
are now gone.
So, after 4 rounds of distributing mangoes, each time giving one mango each so, 5 mangoes
per round, you have got rid of your 20 mangoes so, 20 
 5 is 4. So, here as we have
illustrated, division is actually repeated subtraction. You keep subtracting by the number you
are trying to divide and finally, if you hit 0, then you have divided it exactly.
Well, what if you had only 19 mangoes? Now you know very well that 19 mangoes cannot be
evenly divided into 4 into 5 groups. So, if you would start distributing like we had above the
first three rounds would go fine; you would come from 19 to 14 from 14 to 9 and then you
will come from 9 to 4 and now you have only 4 mangoes left and you have 5 friends so, you
cannot give 1 each.
So, we have managed to distribute 3 times and we have 4 left over. So, formally this is
written as saying that the quotient the number of times you can actually divide without
getting into a fractional part is 3 and the remainder that is after you have a little bit left over
which you cannot subtract one more time is the remainder is 4. So, for 19 
 5, the quotient is
3 and the remainder is 4.
Now, very often we will need to use this remainder and there is a notation for remainder. So,
this is this notation called modulus. So, modulus is another word for remainder and it is
written as mod. So, 19 mod 5 is the same as the remainder when 19 is divided by 5. So,
instead of saying the remainder of 19 divided by 5 is 4, we will often say 19 mod 5 is 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:38)
So, with this notation, we can now define what is a factor. So, a factor is a number which
divides a bigger number evenly without any remainder. So, a | b, if b mod a is 0. Remember
what this mean is means is that if b is divided by a, there is no remainder and we write this
with this vertical bar |. So, on the left is the smaller number, on the right is the bigger number.
So, a divides b this is what this is supposed to say and the other way of thinking about it is
that b is some multiple of a. So, b if a | b then a.k=b ok. So, we have some multiple the some
number of times that a goes into b. So, therefore, b is a multiple of a.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:27)
So, here are some examples we have already seen that 4 |20 because 4 
 5 is 20, 7 | 63
because 7 
 9 is 63, 32 |1024 because 32 
 32 is 1024 and so on.
Now, the symbol that we use for not being a divisor is just to put a stroke across that vertical
line. So, 4 does not divide 19 because there is no way to multiply anything by 4 and get 19.
Similarly, 9 does not divide 100 evenly because we get 9 
11 = 99 and then we go 108.
So, we say formally that a is a factor of b if a | b right. So, a | b is the same as saying that a is
a factor of b and it is easy to see that factors must come in pairs because if a | b then, a goes
into b some k times. So, k | b right so, k 
 a = b so, both k is a factor and a is a factor. So, for
instance, if you take a number 12 then 1 is a factor because 1 divides everything and in fact,
for every number n, 1 
 n is n so, the pair for 1 is always the number itself.
Now in this case, 12 is divisible by 2 and 2 goes in 6 times. So, the pair 2, 6 form 2 factors 6
times 2 is 12, 2 
 6 is 12 and similarly 3 
 4. Now, of course, there is an important side
condition which is that sometimes the pair is the same as the number itself and this happens
when the number actually happens to be a perfect square that is, it is some number multiplied
by itself. So, for instance consider 36 so, 36 is 6 
 6. So, if you look at the factors of 36 and
group them in pairs, then we have 1 and 36, we have 2 and 18, we have 3 and 12, we have 4
and 9 and finally, we have the factor 6, but 6 is multiplied by 6. So, 6 does not produce a new
factor as its pair, it is just itself.
So, another way of thinking about it is that, if you have something which is not a square you
will have an even number of factors, you will have 2 + 2 + 2 +2. If something is a square, you
will have an odd number of factors, you will have 2 + 2 +2 and finally, when you come to the
number of which it is a square that number will come only once in the list of factors.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:45)
So, once we talk about factors, we come to a very interesting class of numbers which are the
prime numbers. So, a prime number is one which has no factors other than 1 and itself. So, 1
is a factor always and 1 
 n is n. So, for we try to usually write p for a prime number. So, a
prime number has only two factors 1 and p.
Now, it is important that it must have two factors, two separate factors. So, one technically is
not a prime because it has only one factor one itself because 1
1 is 1 and so, the only factor
that 1 has is 1. So, the smallest prime actually is 2 because it has two factors 1 and itself 2
and no other factors. 3 is also a prime because it has only 2 factors 1 and 3, 2 does not go into
3 and so on.
So, we are all familiar with the smaller prime numbers. So, 2 is the first prime number, 3 is
the next prime number, then 5, then 7. Notice that, after 2 no even numbers can be primes
because they are all multiples of 2 and so, 2 divides them. Now we come to 9 and 9 is not a
prime number because it is a multiple of 3, but 11 is a prime number and so on.
So, there is actually one clever way which is call the sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime
numbers which is whenever you discover a prime, you knock off all the numbers which are
multiples of it. So, we can do this for instance to get all the prime numbers from 1 to 100. So,
what we do is we first lay out a grid like this right, we know that 1 is not a prime so, the first
prime that we have as a candidate is 2 right. So, this is how the sieve of Eratosthenes works,
you lay out the numbers in a grid and now we can try and mark off all the prime numbers
which are up to 100.
So, we know that 1 is not a prime so, we leave 1 off the grid and we start with 2. So, 2 is our
first prime number and what the sieve of Eratosthenes says is you knock off all multiples of
2. So, you knock off all the even numbers and of course, now you can do it in one shot so,
you can knock off this whole column, this whole column so, all these numbers are not prime
So, now once you have you have a target so, we are looking only up to 100. So, up to 100 we
have knocked off all the powers of 2 or all the multiples of 2. So, now, we look at the first
number which is not been marked off and we notice that 3 is a prime because 3 is not yet
marked off. So, now, we start mark off multiples of 3, some of them are already marked off
because they are multiples of 2. So, 6 is already gone, but 9 is also gone, 12 is already gone,
but 15 is also gone and so on.
So, we can mark off all the other multiples of 2 which are not multiples of 3 and so on right.
So, we get this kind of a picture and now having done this assuming we have done it all the
way, then we will come and find that 5 is a prime right. So, this is the process by which if you
want to know count all the primes up to a certain number n, you can write out all the numbers
up to n and starting at the left you can take the first unmarked number, call it a prime and
mark all its multiples to the right as non primes and the next unmarked number will be the
next prime and so on.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:56)
Now, this is not necessarily an efficient way to do the prime numbers, but this is a good way
to generate them without missing out any. One of the important facts that we use all the time
is that every number can not only be factorized as we have seen into a number of different
pairs of factors it can actually factorize uniquely into the prime numbers that form it.
So, for instance if we look at 12, we said that 12 was 2 times 6, it was also 4 times 3, it was 1
times 12 and so on, but fundamentally it has 3 prime factors 2 2 again and 3. So, depending
on how we combine them for instance, we can get 4 
 3 or we can get 2 
 6 and so on, but 2
 3 is the absolute unique way of writing 12 as a product of prime numbers and using our
exponentiation notation, we can condense this and put the 2 2
s together and say it is22 
Similarly, if we take a number like 126, then it is 2 
 3, 6 
 3, 18 
7 ok. So, the prime factors
are precisely 2 3 twice and 7 and we can write this as 2
 32 
 7. So, this is very important
because we use it implicitly along a lot and we will see later how we use this.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:10)
So, this is called the prime factorization right. So, every integer can be decomposed into a
product of primes in a unique way.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:20)
So, to summarize we started with a natural numbers which we use for counting which are the
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. Then, we extended these numbers with a negative numbers
and this gave us the set of integers. So, the integers include all the natural numbers as well as
the negative numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on -1, -2, -3 and so on. We saw some basic arithmetic
operations on these the usual addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
exponentiation.
We also looked at what happens when we divide integers and we do not want to look at
fractions, then we talk about the quotient which is the integer number of times that the
dividend goes into the number and the remainder is also written as a mod b. So, using this
notation of a mod b, we can talk about divisibility which we write with a vertical bar. So, a | b
if a mod b is 0. So, the factors of a number are those numbers which divide it and a prime
number has exactly two factors 1 and itself and we can always decompose any integer
uniquely into the list of factors, prime factors that multiply out to form that number.
