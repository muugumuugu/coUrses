So, we have seen Sets, now let us move on to Relations.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:17)
As we saw a set is a collection of items and we can construct new sets from old sets. So, we
can take unions combine two sets into one. We can take intersections, take the common
elements. We can take the difference that is take the elements of X which are not in Y and if
we define the universe with respect to which we are working, we can define the complement
those elements that are not in X.
Now, in general we are interested in carving out subsets of a set and so, we use the set
comprehension notation. So, what this does is it takes a base set and takes elements of that
set, then it applies some condition those elements we are interested in and then it collects
them all together. So, we can take all the integers which are divisible by 2 or not divisible by
2 in this case, so we get the odd one; so, those where the remainder is 1.
Or we can take all fractions in which the numerator and the denominator have no common
divisor or we can take for instance the real numbers which lie in an interval with [3,17).
(Refer Slide Time: 01:17)
So, now, we will see a new way to combine sets to form new sets and this is called the
Cartesian product. And, in the Cartesian product basically what we do is we take two sets and
we take one element from each and form a pair. So, A 
 B as it is called is the set of all pairs
which we write with this normal bracket notation (a,b) such that the first element a comes
from the big the set A and the second element comes from the set B.
So, for instance, if A is the set {0, 1} and B is a set {2, 3} then all possible pairs we can form
in the Cartesian product a 0 combined with 2. So, (0, 2), (0 ,3) and then 1 combined with 2, (1
, 2) and (1,3). So, we have four possible pairs.
Now, in sets we said that the order of the element is not important, but of course, when we
are doing this kind of a pairing, then we know that the left set comes from the left part of the
product and the right element comes from the right part of the product. So, for example, (0 ,1)
is not equal to (1 , 0). So, here we have to respect the order when we talk about a pair.
Now, if we have sets of numbers right, then we normally visualize the product as a space
which we draw familiarly as a graph. So, for instance if we take N 
 N then we draw N 
as this grid, where on the x-axis you have one copy of N , on the y-axis you have another
copy of N . And, for example, if you want to look at the pair (2 , 3), then such that the xcoordinate is 2 and the y-coordinate is 3 and you get this point and similarly, if you look at
the point (5 ,6); you get this point right.
So, you can take the first coordinate plot it on the x-axis; take the second coordinate plot it on
the y-axis and where those two points meet in the grid is the point that we are interested in.
So, this is one way of visualizing a binary relation on numbers.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:00)
And, we can do the same thing if you are using say the reals, in which case the grid points
that we are going to plot will have real coordinates and not just natural number coordinates.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:10)
So, now we have this Cartesian product which consists of all possible pairs of the two sets
and as we did with set comprehension we might want to pick out some of these sets some of
these pairs and this is what we call a relation.
So, we combine this Cartesian product operation with set comprehension. So, for instance,
we can take all pairs of numbers which are natural numbers (m ,n), but we want to insist that
the second number is 1 plus the first number.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:40)
So, we get for instance (0, 1) because the second number one is 0 + 1; (2, 3) because 3 is 2 +
1, (17, 18) and so on. And, if we plot these points alone on the right then we get these so, we
get a subset of the overall points and this these points satisfied this set comprehension
condition.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:59)
Another example would be pairs again of natural numbers (d,n), where d is a factor of n.
Remember, d is a factor of n means that if I divide n by d, I get remainder 0. So, for instance
2 is a factor of 82, 14 is a factor of 56. So, these will be points in our relation. So, this is what
is called a binary relation. So, formally it is a subset of the product. So, we take the Cartesian
product all possible pairs and then we apply some kind of a condition which filters out the
pairs of interest to us and it gives us therefore, a subset of pairs and this is what we call a
relation.
Now, to denote the pairs that belonged to the relation either we can give the name of the
relation as a set and say that (a,b) 
R or sometimes to say that a is related to b, we use R as a
kind of operator. We say a is related by R to b and so, we write a R b. So, these are two
notations which you might see in different books and they mean exactly the same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:57)
So, let us let us look at some other examples of relations outside the numbers. So, supposing
you have a school in which there are some teachers and some courses to be taught. So, T is
the set of teachers; C is the set of courses that are being offered in this term, then you need to
describe which teachers are teaching which courses. So, we would have an allocation relation
A which is a subset of all possible pairs T 
So, every teacher and principle could be teaching every course, but of course, this is not
normally the case. We do not have all teachers teaching all courses, we have some teachers
teaching some courses. So, we would specifically say take every pair of possible teacher
course pairs, then we take out those were precisely the teacher T is actually teaching the
course C and we collect those together to form this allocation relation.
So, here is a different graphical way of describing a relation not in terms of the grid and the
graph that we have learned when we do graphs in school. So, this is also called a graph, but
this is a graph in which we have some nodes representing the elements on the set. So, on the
left hand side we have five teachers, on the right hand side we have four courses and the
arrows from the left hand side to the right hand side connect the pairs which are in the
relation. So, we see that Kumar teaches maths; Deb teaches history and so on.
So, this is a useful way of visualizing relations on finite sets and we will see this often as we
go along. Another example of a similar type of a relation is that between a parent and a child
specifically let us look at mothers and children. So, if we have a set of people in a country,
then we can take the set of all pairs of people and then isolate from that pairs in which the
first element of the pair is the mother of the second element. So, we want (m,c) which
belongs to P 
 P such that m is the mother of c.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:49)
So, let us go back to numbers. So, supposing we want to plot all points which are in R 
which are at a distance 5 from (0, 0) which is normally called the origin. So, one thing you
need to know for this we probably you should have learned this at some point is that if I take
a point (a ,b) and calculate its difference from (0 , 0). So, this is calculated using the
Pythagoras theorem and it comes out to be 
 a2 +b2.
So, in other words, the relation we are looking for in this case is all (a,b) whose distance from
(0 , 0) is 5. So, all (a, b) and R cross R such that
 a2 +b2is equal to 5. So, here are some of
the points (0,5) for instance you can see (0, 5) is there because the sum is 0 plus 25 and the
square root of that is 5. (3 ,4) is there because 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, 9 plus 16 is 25,
square root to 25 is again 5.
So, interestingly these points if we plot every such point in R 
 R which satisfies this actually
defines a circle of radius 5 with center at (0 , 0). So, relations can define interesting geometric
shapes and very often we do deal with geometric shapes in this relational form because it is
easier to manipulate than looking at pictures. Now, depending on how we are going to view a
relation, we can look at it in different ways.
So, remember that we looked at rationals in reduced form. So, we said that a rational in
reduced form has p / q such that p and q are integers and the gcd is 1 right; that means, that
they do not have a greatest common divisor other than 1. But, we can also think of this as a
relation on integers itself. We want all pairs of integers. So, every rational is really a pair of
integers, the numerator and the denominator and we want every pair of integers where the
gcd is 1, that is, there is no common divisor.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:51)
So, we do not have to restrict our self to binary relations. The Cartesian product notation
extends to multiple sets. Let us look at three sets for instance. Remember, Pythagoras
theorem which says that the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares on the
opposite sides. So, what values of a, b and c could be the sides of a right triangle are
determined by Pythagoras
s theorem.
So, we would say that a, b and c is a valid triple in the Pythagoras sense if (a, b, c) belongs to
 N . So, here we now have three copies of N and a, b, c must all be nonzero. They
must all be positive length we do not want to have triangles in which one line one side is
collapsed to a point and we want the constraint that a2 +b2 =c2 .
(Refer Slide Time: 09:41)
Here is another example. Suppose, we look at squares on the plane squares with real corners
right. So, a corner is a point (x , y) which is in R 
 R . So, we define the x coordinate and the
y coordinate that defines the corner of a square and we want four corners which together form
a square if we connect them by lines. So, for instance, if you look on the right the four blue
dots correspond to a square which is cornered at (0, 0); (0, 2); (2, 0) and (2, 2).
The red square is also red points also define a square because this is a rotated square, but then
if you rotate it vertically; you will turn out that this diamond is actually a square. So, there are
many such four sets of points which form the corners of squares and we might be interested
in all such four sets of points. So, now, we have a relation which involves four sets of points,
but each point itself is a pair of real numbers; it is an x and a y.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:35)
So, square if we think of it as a relation is actually a relation on R 2 that is the first corner
times R 2 the second corner times R 2 the third corner and the fourth corner R 2 again. So, this is
actually either a relation on eight copies of R or if you want to group it four copies of pairs of
So, this just says that we can take relations on arbitrary an arbitrary number of copies of a set
and we get larger and larger from pairs, we move to triples we move to quadruples and in
general if we have n copies we call this an n tuples.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:11)
So, there are some special binary relations which pop up all over the place. So, it is useful to
know their names. The first one is called the identity relation and as you would expect, the
identity relation maps every element to itself. So, if I take A 
 A, so, first of all the identity
relation is defined on two copies of the same set because identity means equality. So, I take A
 A. So, this has all kinds of pairs (a , b), where both a and b belong to A and now, I want the
condition that a = b.
So, in other words, I want things of the form (a , a). So, if I plot this for instance on the
natural numbers and N 
 N , then I get (0, 0); (1, 1) and so on, and these are the points which
are drawn on the right in this grid.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:05)
Now, point of notation we sometimes it is tedious to write this notation as it is says us (a,b)
time in n. So, we do not want to you know have to write out this long thing. So, sometimes
we simplify this by saying I want all pairs such that a comma a belongs to A 
 A. So, what
we are really saying is that the second day and the first day must be the same. So, we are
collapsing the equality and this. Now, this is not technically correct, but this is often used in
order to simplify the notation.
And, sometimes we might drop the product altogether. We might just say we want all pairs (a
,a)where a comes from the set A. So, in other words we are pulling out one copy of the
element from the set and then we are constructing a pair by taking two copies of it. So, all of
these are equivalent ways of writing this although only the first one technically follows the
notation that we are using to introduce relations.
Now, there are some properties that relations may have. The first one is called reflexivity. So,
reflexivity refers to the fact that an element is related to itself. So, a reflexive relation is one
in which for every element a; (a,a) belongs to R. So, in other words based on what we just
wrote above, it means that the identity relation is included in R. So, it does not mean that is
the only thing. The identity relation has only the reflexive elements. A relation that is
reflexive will have the identity pairs and it will have other pairs, but it must have all the
identity pairs to be called reflexive.
A symmetric relation for instance is one where if (a, b) is there, then (b, a) must be there. So,
for instance looking at reflexive relations, one example is the division relation. So, if we
provided we make sure that the numbers are not 0, then we know it is reflexive because every
number divides itself. So, if we take the reflect division relation as the relation that we
introduced in the first part of this lecture that would be reflexive because a divides a for every
a which is not 0.
Similarly, symmetric relations if we look at pairs where the greatest common divisor is 1, in
other words they have no common divisors. This is what happens for example, in reduced
fractions, then it does not matter whether we write it as (a , b) or (b, a). So, if (a, b) has
greatest common divisor 1, so does (b , a). So, (a, b) and (b, a) must both either be there in
the relation or neither will be there.
Similarly, if we look at this which is asking about the absolute value so, it is saying give me
all numbers a and b such that a - b is either 2 or -2. So, the absolute value takes the difference
and removes the negative sign. Now, we see that for instance if (5, 7) is there, then (7, 5)
must be there because they both have the same difference depending on how we write it.
Normally, in subtraction we have a sign difference, but because we are taking the absolute
value there is no difference actually between these two. So, this absolute value relation also if
we fix is a symmetric relation.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:51)
A third property that relations may have and which are useful is called transitivity. So,
transitivity says that if we have two pairs which are related such that they share an elements.
So, a is related to b and b is related to c, then a must be related to c. So, again our divisibility
is a relation. So, supposing we say that 2 | 6 and we say that 6 | 36, then from this we can
conclude that 2 | 36 as well, right.
Similarly, if we take less than if we say that 3 < 10 and 10 < 28, then we know from this that
3 < 28. So, this is transitivity.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:34)
So, if we want to draw it pictorially if we have three elements a, b and c and this arrow
remember we had this graph notation which says a is related to b and b is related to a, then
this dashed line represents the requirement for transitivity a must be related to c.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:49)
Now, we saw symmetry. So, symmetry says that if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) must also be in R.
Anti-symmetry says something different it says if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) should not be in R.
So, less than for example, which was transitive above is also anti-symmetric. If you take
strictly less than, if a is strictly less than b; then it cannot be that be strictly less than a. So,
this is an anti symmetric relation, but anti symmetry does not require that one of the two must
be there. It only says that if one pair is there the opposite pair should not be there ok.
Similarly, if we look at our mother and children example; obviously, if p is the mother of c
then c cannot be the mother of p ok. Now, there may be p and c such that neither p is the
mother of c nor is c is the mother of p. So, that is allowed. We do not insist that every pair (p,
c) must be related one way or another, but if it is related one way it should not be related the
other way is what anti-symmetry says.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:46)
So, if we combine some of these conditions, we get an interesting class relations called
equivalence relations. So, equivalence relation is something that is reflexive, symmetric and
transitive. So, as an example supposing we connect together all numbers which have the same
remainder modulo 5. So, for instance 7 has a remainder 2 with respect to 5 and so does 22.
So, 7 and 5 would be related in this way if we define the relationship as having the same
remainder modulo 5.
Now, notice that if two numbers have the same remainder modulo 5; that means, that going
from one number to the other you are going in multiples of 5. So, for instance 22 -7 is 15
right. So, this is this modulo arithmetic. So, if you add the number that you are dividing by,
then you get the same remainder and so, in set notation we can say that the integers modulo 5
are all pairs a, b such that b - a mod 5 is 0. In other words, we are not asking what is the
actual remainder of b and a, we are just saying that b and a are separated by a multiple of 5
therefore, they must have the same remainder modulo 5.
Now, this divides the integers into five groups if I based on the remainder. So, there are the
group of numbers which are divisible by 5, they have remainder 0. Those like 6, 11 and all
which have remainder 1; 7, 12 and all which one remainder 2 and so on. So, we have five
possible remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and therefore, this divides the set of integers into five disjoint
classes.
As an example of modulo arithmetic that we are all familiar with, consider what happens
when we look at a normal clock. Now, a normal clock measures time from 0 to 12 and then
cycles around again. So, though there are 24 hours in a day, the clock is actually partitioning
these 24 into two sets where we have 0 and 12 as same, 1 and 13 as same and so on right. So,
2 am and 2 pm, there is no distinction on the clock.
So, the clock is actually showing us this equivalence class of hours regarding am and pm as
being equal and we have to know from context whether the clock is showing am or pm. So,
the main thing to note about an equivalence relation is that it partitions a set. It partitions a set
into disjoint groups, all of the elements within a group are equivalent and all of the elements
outside across groups are not equivalent to each other.
So, the groups of equivalent elements that we formed through an equivalence relation are
called equivalence classes. So, this might look a little abstract now, but equivalence classes
really represent a kind of equality and sometimes we are happy to work with this equality in
terms of equivalence relations rather than actual equality and it has very much the same
properties as equality does.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:28)
So, to summarize as we have seen a Cartesian product can generate n-tuples of elements from
n sets. So, if we have X 1, X 2 , up to X n , n sets these can be different or the same, then we can
take one element from each set and form an n-tuple x 1, x2 , up to x n. And, when we now pick
out some particular subset of these n-tuples, we get a relation. So, for instance, if we take
pairs from N 
 R and we want the second element of the pair the real number to be the
square root of the first element, then we get N 
 R such that r = 
So, here on the right we have seen we show one picture of this. So, there are some elements
like (2, 
 2 ), (4 , 2) , (7, 
 7 ) and so on. Now, just notice that in this picture the y-axis is
elongated compared to the x-axis. So, this is not in some sense to scale in both dimensions
because the square root function behaves like this.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:27)
So, we have seen that there are some properties that we would like to record of binary
relations 
 reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and sometimes anti-symmetry. And, using
reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity together we get what is called an equivalence relation,
an equivalence relations partition sets into equivalence classes which behave like equality.
Thank you.
