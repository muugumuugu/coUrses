In our sixth question, there is a sniper who shoots a bullet at some inclination from the ground
towards a bird flying in the 
 direction, some bird is flying in the 
 direction at a constant
height of 1600 feet. Because of gravity, the path of the bullet is projected as shown in this
diagram. So, this is the bullet, it is going in this particular parabolic path and this is the bird
which is going in the 
 direction at a constant height of 1600 feet.
Now, they have given the height y of the bullet at t seconds as this function, this is a quadratic
function 
 2 , where 
 is the initial vertical speed and that is also given here, it is
equal to 400 feet per second and the value of 
 is also given here, 32 
 2 . And then, the
distance travelled by the bullet in 
 direction is given by 
 and 
 = 400 feet per
second, neglecting the effect of the wind and everything, find the position of hitting?
Where will the bullet hit the bird and that would be here where y = 1600 for the bullet. So, let
us use the y equation and the y equation is 
 2 . So, 
 2 = 
, so we know 
supposed to be 1600 and 
 is 400, so we get 400
 2 . So, 2 ones and 2 16s, now
you can cancel off 16 here with this is equal to and this becomes 100 and this becomes 25.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:34)
So, we get a quadratic equation which is 
 + 100 = 0 and if we solve for the roots of
this equation, we get the time when y is 1600 and we will get 2 times because y is 1600 twice
on this path. So, we will get 
1 and 
2 , we are looking for 
1 because that is where the bullet
will hit the bird. So, your two roots are using the formula
, here you will get it as
So, that gives us
which then given us
. So, we have one solution, 
25+15
. So, this is equal to 5 and this is equal to 20. Clearly, 
1 =5 seconds is where our
bullet will hit the bird. This is 
1 =5 seconds. And we already know the y coordinate of this
place so, for finding the position what is left is to find the x coordinate which we will get from
 where, 
 is already given to be 400.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:23)
So, 
 = 400 
1 which is 5 and that is equal to 2000 feet.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:35)
Thus, the 
 coordinate for the point of hitting is 2000 and the 
 coordinate is 1600 feet. And
this is the point where it hits.
