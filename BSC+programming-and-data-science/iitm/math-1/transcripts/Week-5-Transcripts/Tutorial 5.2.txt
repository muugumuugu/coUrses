We are supposed to use this information this particular table to solve question 2 and 3. We will do
a question 2 now. And this table will give us the variation of approximate temperature T. So, this
is a temperature T in 
 at a particular place with time small t, so this is the time. So, the time and
the respective temperatures are given in this table.
And Anshu fit a quadratic equation for temperature during day time as 
) = 
 2 + 5
25. Where 
 is the number of hours after 8 am. So, 
 begins from 0 for 
 = 0. If we wrote
additionally here this is 0, this is 1, this is 2, this is 3, this is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. So, we
have x going from 0 to 12. If she will not, so if Anshu will not go out of her home the temperature
is greater than 40 degrees.
So, greater than 40 degrees and Anshu will not go out of the home. Then what is the minimum
time gap when she will not go out? Which means what is the time when the temperature is greater
than 40. And this is on the basis of this particular quadratic equations. So, we are essentially trying
to solve this as 
) > 40. So, that means 
 2 + 5
 + 25 > 40.

And that would indicate that 0.4
 + 15 < 0. So, if we took all the LHS to the RHS this is
what you will get and this is an upward facing parabola. So, the parabola will be like this and we
are looking for the portion where you have the value, the y value to less than 0. So, that would be
happen between the roots for this we find out the roots using the formula
And how did we know that this parabola is upward facing because a is greater than 0, a here is 0.4
b is -5 and c is 15. So, these roots will come out to be 5 
 0.4 
 15 that is 16
0.4 that
is 6 
4 that is 24. So, divided by 2
 is 0.8.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:46)
So, our roots are 5 plus or minus 1 divided 0.8 which is one is 6/ 0.8 and the other is 4/ 0.8. So,
that gives us the roots as 7.5 and 5. So, these are the roots 5 and 7.5 and that means, this condition
that is the temperature being greater than 40 is satisfied between 5 hours and 7.5 hours. That would
be from here till somewhere in between here that is 15, 30. So, from 1 pm to 3:30 pm is the time
suggested by the curve fit that Anshu has drawn but clearly this is wrong because it is already 43
here, and 48, here and 46, and 43, and 40, and 40 so it is a much larger duration where the
temperature is greater than 40 degrees Celsius. So, this particular curve fit is pretty bad.
