This is the pretty straight forward question, we are given a quadratic equation and we are asked to
find the roots and also calculate the sum and product of roots. So, the roots we are going to get
from the formula again which is
 is 1. So, we have
So, we have
. So, that gives us, here in this case 
 is 5, 
 is 8 and
. And if we simplify it taking 2 common out, you will get
because the 4 comes out of the square root and becomes 2. And
(Refer Slide Time: 1:44)
And the sum of these roots is if you just add them up you will ge
so you get
So, these get canceled
is the sum. And in terms of product you basically doing (
) so you
will get ( 5 )2 
11 2
So, that gives us
= 5. So, this is the product of the roots.
are just sum and product of the roots respectively.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:43)
The question is asking us to prove that the sum and product of roots for any quadratic equation
will be this and this respectively.
are left with
respectively. So, all we need to do for this is to sum
. This we are summing with 2
, 2 and 2 cancel off and you have
a. So, clearly these two cancel off and you
is sum of roots.
And when we do the product again it is in the (
) form so we will get( 2
 )2 
which gives us 4
. So, that gives us
 2 cancels off then
we have 4 4 going away 
 going away so you were left with 
. So, this is the product of
roots for a quadratic equation.
