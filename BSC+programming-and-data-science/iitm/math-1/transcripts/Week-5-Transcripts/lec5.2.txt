In this video we are going to learn one more interesting method called Solving quadratic
equations or for finding the roots of quadratic equation. The method named completing the
Square method also it has a very good connection with a very well-known or very popularly
known as Quadratic formula. So, we will explore that connection towards the end of this video.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:44)
So, let us start I will demonstrate this method through some examples. So, let us first understand
or revise what we done in the earlier stage or in the earlier video. We have used a method of
Factoring that I have called as old method. So, let us take this example
If you
use the method of factoring you need to identify what is this term 24 and 1. So,
is the product of the leading coefficient and the constant term and
So, I have this setup which is
so - 24
. So, I will essentially use a prime
factorization theorem and get the prime factors of -24 so that if you rearrange the prime factors
in such a way that the sum should be equal to 10. One such rearrangement is 12 and -2. So, ad is
12 and bc is -2. So, I got this and then based on our factorization technique I will substitute this
12 and 2 for this coefficient if x and I will get this expression which is
Then I will use the greatest common factor technique that is I will take out x common, 2
common from the last 2 terms and I will get this expression. So, finally, I got
and therefore, I will get the roots of the equation are -12 and 2. Now, somebody came up and
thought, that why should I bother what is this last term? It is just a constant right, so I will
replace this constant with something and I will work on it.
So, from that particular though comes the new method, which is the method of completing the
square. So, what that person did is just rewrite this expression into this form that is
. Now, the next question that person asked is if I look at this
, do I know something that
will make this particular expression as a complete square. So, what do I mean by complete
square let us understand?
So, complete square means
if I want to write
then what I need to do here is to
add some number and subtract some number or to add this same number on both sides right. So,
in this case if you look at this expression that is
which is
. So, this a is the
number that I am looking for. Now, in this case if I consider this expression and if I want to add
a number which will typically be
what that
should be, Is the first question.
So, to answer that let us equate this 10 to this 2a, so
what will be
will be
therefore
is the answer. So,
which is 25. So, now I got a number
to add and subtract
from both sides. So, what I will do is I will add the number 25 on both sides so once I add the
number 25 on both sides for this expression. I get
, it turns out here in this
case that the number is 49 which is also a perfect square.
But it need not be the case all the time. So, now what I know here is this number this particular
expression is nothing but
other side is
from this formula. Formula that is given here and then what is
. So, I can rewrite this expression as
wonderful.
So, I got something in terms of squares, now had it been only one square then in the situation
was easy I would have equated to
. But there will be two situations because both the
terms on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side are squares. Now, you just write
that will give us four cases.
But if you look at these two expressions, they will eventually reduce to the same two expressions
that is
. So, it is sufficing to consider only two equations
. Once I have
considered this then I know the solution right, so it is just a matter of substituting the values and
doing some little bit of algebra. So, you subtract 5 from both sides so
me 2, and
which will give
which will give me -12.
These are the roots of the quadratic equation, these exactly match with the roots that we have got
-12 and 2, and here 2 and -12. So, the solution set is same therefore now it is a personal choice
which method to prefer but what is a choice that is available if you have some difficulty in
factoring this. Let us say this is not 24 but some absurd number and you have some difficulty in
factoring this finding prime factorization.
What you are doing here is you are not using this particular property when you are doing this
example. When you are solving this example through this method you are not using this
particular property so you can get rid of this property and you do not have to worry about. One
note of caution is you cannot use this method when the number given here becomes negative in
this side because square root of a negative number is not defined.
So, after adding this a and the number still remains negative you cannot use this method because
according to this method there is no real solution whereas we do not know. So, this method had
some limitations but it is quite powerful in solving the problems okay. We will come to how to
overcome the limitations in a certain in the next few slides and we will see its beautiful
connection with the quadratic formula.
