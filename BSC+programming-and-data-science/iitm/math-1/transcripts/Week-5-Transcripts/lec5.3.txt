Quadratic formula
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
So, let us now go when the right-hand side is not a perfect square. In this case the righthand side was a perfect square. So, when right hand side is not a perfect square, let us
take this expression where;
. So, I have already done the first step, I
have added it. So, you can see the left-hand side is nothing, but
which is equal to
32 and 32 is not the perfect square.
So, in such case what will happen? So, you will equate you will go in a similar manner
, you will take a positive square root of the left-hand side and
can be decomposed into
. So,
is 4. So, it is
So, you will get 2 two roots;
are irrational roots because,
are the roots of the quadratic equation and they
is an irrational number ok. It is interesting to verify this
result using a graph because, that will give us the clear cut understanding where does this
are mapped. The two green dots over here represent the location of the roots ok.
So, this is how you will solve a quadratic equation using the method of completing the
squares.
Now let us explore the relation between quadratic equations method finding the roots
using quadratic equations. Sorry; finding the roots of quadratic equations using
completing the square method and its connection with quadratic formula.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:05)
So, for this let us take a general quadratic function equated to 0 that is;
n is the second step is because
that will give us the second step.
. I can easily divide a I can easily divide by a; so
Now, as far as we can understand what we have here is,
is the constant term. So, as
per if we go by our method of completing the square, we will push this
side. So, it will take a negative sign that is what you are seeing here
And, now,
was the term
on the other
was the term, if it is a complete square
will have
come. So, I will get a term which is our a in the earlier expression that will be
will be
both sides
, which is the term that I will add on both sides. So, I have added on
Now, look at this expression carefully, what is this expression? This is
this is some constant. So, I will use this that is;
this term,
. So,
is equal to we can rearrange
is the LCM. So, you just multiply by 4a over here you will get
there and divide by 4a so you will get
. This is what you will get if you
rearrange these terms hm. Sorry, it is wrong.
It is
it is. This is wrong. It should be
root of this then you will get
and then once you take the square
So, effectively using the same method of completing the square, the root of this equation
will be
; as easy as this. So, this method is very powerful; this is
what we have done using method of completing the squares and it gives us a general
formula which is called quadratic formula. So, this formula is known as quadratic
formula and the term over here in the square root is known as discriminant.
What is the quadratic formula? This complete expression on the right-hand side is a
quadratic formula. And the term in the square root since
is called the
discriminant. Why? Because it discriminates.
Let us see, if this
; that simply means we have two real roots. If this
; that means, we have only one repeated root. And if
, then we
are actually taking square root of a negative number which will go to the complex
domain. So, it has no real roots.
So, let us summarize this method or the summary of this method into a table.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:03)
So, value of the discriminant suppose
and the discriminant
is a
perfect square; that means, I know the square root of it then we have two real rational
roots. If
, but it is not a perfect square; then I have two real irrational roots.
We have already seen in week 1 that real number line is divided into rational numbers
and irrational numbers. So, this is the splitting which will help. So, if
not a perfect square I will get irrational number. If
get a rational number. If
, but
is a perfect square, I will
, then I will get one real rational root. And if
, I do not have any root.
Let us demonstrate it through some graphs which we have seen which we have already
seen. So, here is the example; where
. These are the two roots of this
quadratic equation which are given here.
Let us say
, this is the root only one root it has and it is repeated. And if
, our example was
. So, in this case right it never touches the
minimum; so you will get this particular expression ok.
, it never really
touches the x axis. That is the verification that we have something like this ok.
So, let us go to the next slide which is actually yeah of course, these are the conditions
that are required where a, b, c are rational numbers because, I am telling that this is this
is will be a rational root. So, if it is not rational then what you need to do is; you suppress
this, you do not need to say anything about this.
If they are rational numbers then whatever I am saying over here is true and whatever I
am saying over here is true. If they are not rational numbers still you will have two real
roots, but I cannot say whether they will be rational or irrational. And you will you may
have one real root, but it can be irrational also. For example,
then still you will get root as a
which is an irrational number.
So, that is so in order to distinguish between rational and irrational you need a condition
that a, b, c are rational numbers. If you do not want to distinguish between rational and
irrational numbers you do not need this condition. You can have a, b, c as real numbers;
only condition that will prevail is
(Refer Slide Time: 09:21)
So, let us go ahead and see some examples where I will use the discriminant formula or
quadratic formula to distinguish between the roots. So, the question itself says; find the
value of discriminant for each equation and then describe the number and type of roots
for the equation.
So, let us take the first example is
So, it is b is -12, a is a is 9 and c is 4. So,
similar manner let us take the next equation which
. So, I want to evaluate
I want to evaluate for this. In a
; where b will be
16, a will be 2 and c will be 33.
Let us evaluate
36 4s are 144 and
for the first equation that is;
. So, 9 4s are 36,
is also 144. So, 144 - 144, if you refer to the previous table it has
only one repeated rational root.
You go to the second example
is 256,
; b is 16, a is 2 and c is 33. So, if you look at it
is 264 yes. So, I got 256 - 264; that means, I got -8. Therefore, the
, and hence it will have no real root ok. This is the summary of using the
discriminant method.
The discriminant method or the quadratic formula actually gives you a number of ways
to handle the problem. So, in short what we have seen today is, we can solve an equation
given that I know the values of a, b and c using the quadratic formula. So, let us
summarize what are all the methods that we have studied in this particular example ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:45)
So, the summary of concepts is; let us say I have a method which is called graphing
method. This is the method which we started with. When do we use this method? The
graphing method actually unless your solutions are integers will not give you a good
result.
But it is a best method to verify your results or verify the results that you have actually
found algebraically. If there is any calculation mistake or something it will be revealed
very easily. So, the graphing method is very helpful when you want to verify the result,
but you can also use it to find roots of the equation occasionally.
Similarly, factoring method also suffers from the disadvantage that; it may not be helpful
if the factors are not easily visible. For example, you may get the constant term to be
equal to 26.2 in the quadratic equation. The constant term is 26.2 and then, you may have
tough time in visualizing the factors.
So, in such cases factoring method need not be used, but it is very helpful if the constant
term is 0 or the factors are easy to find you can actually guess the factors if the nice
numbers like 49, 24 all these nice numbers are there then you can very well go with
factorization method.
The method of completing the squares all the time it works; it is very easy when b is
even. Otherwise, you will have problems if the right-hand side in the method of
completing the square is negative, that is you will go to complex domain and then you
may have some problems which we are not dealing with in this course. So, for us it can
be always used when b is even ok.
Now last method is quadratic formula, which is derived from which is derived from
method of completing the square. And this gives you all the time this is this will give the
answer all the time it is always helpful for. So, for our purposes when we are studying
these methods these two methods; completing the square and quadratic formula will
always give the answer irrelevant of whether the coefficients are rational numbers,
irrational numbers, or some absurd numbers ok.
Now, let us go to one more concept which is called axis of symmetry. I have not given
any derivation about axis of symmetry yet.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:33)
So, let us start with axis of symmetry. We already know while graphing the graphing the
quadratic function it is very important to know the axis of symmetry. And we have
boldly claimed at
is the axis of symmetry. Now I will answer the question why
is the axis of symmetry. This is an application of method of completing the
square.
So, let us assume that I have been given a general quadratic function
. So, I will pull out a common and therefore, my expression will become
. Now, when I was completing the square I was throwing
on the right
hand side, but this time that provision is not there.
So, I will retain
only thing is I will split the entire expression. So, when I split the
entire expression, I will get a as it is and this expression as it is here
should come;
that means,
I will add and subtract
ok. And therefore, I will get this
expression. Once I get this expression, I will recognize this term this entire term so these
three terms together as
Now you look at this equation correctly. For example, this is a quadratic function written
in a different form. What is this number? This is some constant ok. This is some constant
and now you look at this number this is actually deciding the symmetry around x
symmetry on x axis.
If you put
as one vertical line; everything because
y axis, everything will be symmetric about
it is symmetric about that
. This expression defines the
symmetry of the relation or the symmetry of the function because this is nothing, but just
a constant on y axis.
Therefore, this x is equal x. So, basically you will write
. So,
vertical line is the axis of symmetry for this expression. So, the symmetry about
that
Therefore, this is known as axis of symmetry that answers the quadratic equation axis of
symmetry question. Why
is the axis of symmetry?
This ends our topic on quadratic functions and quadratic equations.
