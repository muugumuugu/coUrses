## Lec 06 - Relations

> A filtered subset of a Cartesion Product b/w sets.

> Can also be denoted by a node-edge (*bipartite*) graph between the vertices taken from set-1 to set-2.
>> two vertices v<sub>a</sub> v<sub>b</sub>, representing  a ‚àà A & b ‚àà B respectively , are connected iff aRb. that is the relation holds for that pair.

###examples

+ Square in 2D real plane is a relation on ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>X‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>X‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>X‚Ñù<sup>2</sup> , and also on ‚Ñù<sup>8</sup>. The relation is that the tuple defines being a corner.

###equivalence relations

---

## Lec 07 - Functions

> ùëì : X ‚Üí Y, a subset of a relation where the first element is resticted to no repetations. THis constricted subset is like a Map from set of elements in X to Y.
>>the set of first elements of tuples: Domain on which function acts.
>>the set of second elements of tuples: Range of function.

###Bijections

+ Injective : One-One.
+ Surjective : Onto.

###Tables As Relations.
> Extended relations . Each entry a n-tuple, where elements are mutually related by some condition. the set of such conditions is fixed and ordered and is consistent aross rows
>> If one column is unique it can be used as a key, and if two tables share sucha column, a new table can be created by performing a ***join***, that is extending the relations via the key element, and selecting different columns from the two or more tables.

>>Arithmetic Operations are defined in terms of Set Building operations (Union, Intersection & Cartesion Product)

### Is there a Set of All Sets??? - Russel's Paradox

>generating by set comprehension. we can have a set of all sets that do not contain themselves then, this set contain itself impies that it does not contain itself and hence the paradox.
>> so therefore it is not definitive to form a set of all sets, and unrestricted comprehension will always lead to a paradox.

> In general call any unsuitable collection a ***Class***.

---

## Lec 11 - Degrees of Infinity

>Enumaration - ***bijection*** with ‚Ñï
>> Enumerable Sets are called Countable. They may be finite or infinite

## Lec 59 - Introduction to Graphs
### Graph = (V,E)
+ V = set of vertices / nodes
+ E = set of edges, is a subset of VxV, that is, it is a binary relation on the nodes

#### Directed Graph
+ (v,v') ‚àà E doesnot ‚áí (v',v) ‚àà E
#### Un-Directed Graph
+ eg -freindships
+ (v,v') ‚àà E  ‚áí (v',v) ‚àà E
+ effectively (v,v') is the same edge as (v',v)

### Path
* sequence of vertices connected by edges.
* no vertice is re[eated
* every adjacent vertice in the seqeunce share an edge

### walk
* path with freedom of repeating vertices.


#### reachable vertex
* v is reachable from u if there is a path from   u to v.

#### connected graph
* example flight landings
* every vertice is reachable from every other vertice

---

## Lec 60 - Some general graph problems

### map coloring
+ example min classroom for overlapping timeslots
* states that share a border should be different color
* create a graph
	* each state = vertex
	* edge relation = sharing border
	* problem becomes assigning colors to nodes so that endpoins of an edge have diff colors.
	* for planar graphs , 4 colors suffice. -- Four color theorem

### vertex covering
* example= installing cct cameras
	+ vertices = intersections of coridors
	+ Edges = corridor segments connecting intersections
* smallest set of V to cover all the edges

### independent set
* example group dances
	* vertices = dances
	* edges = have common dancers
	* dances we can have so as to have one dancer perform only once
* set of vertices such as none of them share an edge

### matching
* example - class project
	* group of freinds
* subset of E of mutually disjoint edges
* maximal matching, max cardinality matching
* perfect matching, covers all vertices.

---

## Lec 61 - Representation of graphs

### adjacency matrix
* map vertex names to integer indices
* Matrix entry (i,j) = 1 if (v·µ¢,v‚±º) is an edge , 0 otherwise
* columns represent incoming edges
* rows represent outgoing edges
* wastes lots of space because typically |E|<< n¬≤
>degree
>>d(v)= number of edges incident on i

### adjacency list
> list of neighbour indices for any vertices
>> time costly for neighbourhood scanning, etc.

--

## Lec 62 - Breadth-first neighbour search

* do it level by level
* implement using queue(FIFO)
* visit closest ( 1-step away) neighbours and mark them for exploration by adding them to the queue.
* repeat closest neighbour exploration for each item in queue, dequeuing it and flaging it as visited,till queue is empty, adding to queue only unvisited neighbours.
* necessarily mark each visited node with a flag so as to not loop infinitely.
* to store and extract path --> store parents, while exploring nearest neighbours, store parent in addition to flagging the neighbour visited.
* can also store level insted of visited flag --> unvisited =level -1
* on exploration of each item's nearest neighbours, while adding parent increment level.

---

## Lec 63 - Depth-first search
* implement using stack (LIFO)
* explore fully till the end a neighbour to its fring end and then back track to the parent and explore its other neighbours
* keep backtracking and exploring till u reach back the root, and it has no new neighbours to explore.

### uses
* find *cut vertices* - vertices which connect the graph, on deleting the graph no longer remains connected.
* find bridge - edges that connect the graph.
* cannot find shortest path :(


---

## Lec 64 - Applications of BFS and DFS-1
1. From bfs parent list --> get shortest path of unweighted graph.
2. finding components of a graph. (mutually unconnected maximal connected subgraphs)
	a. starts bfs/dfs at vertex 0  -- initialize component number 0 and assign it to each node as u visit it.
	b. increment component number and start scan on smallest unvisited node.
2. detecting cycles. - walk that ends on the same vertex, without repeating an edge
	+ simple cycle - only repeated vertice is the start/end.
	+ maintain a DFS counter that is incremented both at start and end of exploring a node
	+ assign nodes these entry and exit numbers

### tree
1. minimally connected graph.
2. edges explored by a BFS form one tree per component.
3. collection of trees= forest.
4. N vertice tree necessarily has n-1 edges.
5. acyclic graph.


* any non tree edge creates a cycle.



## Lec 65 - Applications of BFS and DFS-2
### directed cycles
### non-tree edges
1. Forward edges
2. Backward edges -- form cycles
3. Cross edged - across branches
#### classifying using dfs numbers
1. forward :Interval  \[pre(start),post(start)\] contains \[pre(end),post(end)\]
2. backward:Interval  \[pre(end),post(end)\] contains \[pre(start),post(start)\]
3. cross :Intervals  \[pre(start),post(start)\] & \[pre(end),post(end)\] are disjoint.
### strong connections
two vertices have both paths from v1 to v2 and v2 to v1.
#### Strongly Connected Components:
> directed graph decomposition
