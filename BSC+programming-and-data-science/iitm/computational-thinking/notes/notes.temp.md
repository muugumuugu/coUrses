# WEEK 8

---

---

## lec 8.1 - Representation of a graph as an adjacency matrix to find shortest distance and time

+ graph connections represented in matrix with true / weight at i,j if âˆƒ edge i,j.
+ edge weight = distance/ fare etc.
+ distance  --> matrix multiplication

---

## lec 8.2 - Construction of a graph where trains are nodes and stations are edges

+ delay propogation
+ stringing nodes

---
## lec 8.3 - Pseudocodes for finding a route between two stations using no hops, one hop, two hops and n hops


---

## lec 8.4 - Pseudocode for edge labeled graph

---

## lec 8.5 - Depth First Search (DFS) and recursive procedure call

* reachability of stations example
+ finding cycles - mentoring example.
+ connecting both train and stations graph via mutual recursive calls.

---

## lec 8.6 - Pseudocode for recursion

---

## lec 8.7 - Pseudocode for Depth First Search (DFS) and recursive procedure call


---
