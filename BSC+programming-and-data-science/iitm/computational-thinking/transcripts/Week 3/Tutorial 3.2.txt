Tutorial 3.2
Hello, CT students, in this tutorial we will look at a task which is similar to the one performed by
professors in lecture 20. In lecture 20, professors try to filter out the score cards with less than
average, below average scores.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:34)
So, for that they first calculate the average by finding the sum and the count and finally they
divide the total sum by the total count for the average.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:53)
Once they find the average, they do a second iteration where they go card by card finding every
card where the score is below average and they note down those cards. So, this is how the
filtering is done in a second iteration. So, one iteration goes into finding the average and the
second iteration goes into finding the below average cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:16)
Now, in our tutorial task we will do something very similar which is we will find all the bills
which are above the average bill amount. So, for that we have to first find the bill amount, so we
should find the sum and the count. So, let us go card by card, for our first card the total bill
amount the sum would be simply 567 and the count is 1 card.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:55)
And then we have 1525, which gives us the sum of 567 plus 1525 is 2092 for 2 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:13)
And then we get the 1341 included we will have 3433 for 3 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:24)
Then we have 123 adding which is 3556 for 4 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:33)
Now, we have 4174 adding which gives us 7730 for 5 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:46)
Then 354 is going to give us 8084 for 6 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:57)
Now 96 is going to give us 8180 for 7 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:07)
Now, 3132 additionally gives us 11312 for 8 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:20)
Then an additional 595 gives us 11907 for 9 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:32)
Then this 378 gives us 12285 for 10 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:45)
Now, we have an 893 which will give us 13178 for 11 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:58)
And now another 186 which gives us 13364 for 12 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:10)
Now, we are at 3060 additionally that will give us 16424 for 13 cards. Going further.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:27)
We have 656 here, which indicates we have a sum of 17080 for 14 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:39)
And 229 additionally will give us 17309 for 15 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:49)
Now, 187 more that is 17496 for 16 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:59)
Plus 279 which is 17775 for 17 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:10)
Now, we have 603 next, which gives us 18378 for 18 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:22)
Now, another 592 gives us 18970 for 19 cards. Going further.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:36)
622 which in the sum will give us 19592 for 20 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:48)
Now, we have 128 additionally that gives us 19720 for 21 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:05)
Then we have 315 which is 20035 for 22 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:17)
Then, 888 is 20923 for 23 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:28)
Then a 92 gives us 21015 for 24 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:37)
Now, 1364 gives us 22379 for 25 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:50)
Next we have a 276 giving us a sum of 22655 for 26 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:01)
And then an additional 340 which is 22995 for 27 card.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:12)
Then we have 514 giving us 23509 for 28 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:22)
And then 23615 for 29 cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:28)
And lastly we have this 798 which is giving us 24413 for 30 cards. So, this is our total sum and
this is the total count. Now, we know average is a total sum by the total count which gives us
24413 divided by 30, this is equal to 2441.3 divided by 3, which then comes out to be roughly
813.77. So, this is roughly our average bill amount. Now, what we do is we look at the above
average cards in the second iteration. And these for these we can go in any order, so we will go
in reverse order now, 798 is not greater than 813.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:08)
106 is not greater than 813.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:11)
514 is not.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:13)
340 is not.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:14)
276 is not.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:16)
1364, so our first bill here is 25, bill number 25 is above average expenditure.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:27)
92 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:28)
888 is large, so 23 is also an above-average bill.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:35)
315 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:36)
128 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:38)
622 small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:39)
592 small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:41)
603 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:43)
279 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:44)
187 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:45)
229 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:47)
656 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:48)
3060, so bill number 13 is also an above-average bill.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:57)
186 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:59)
893 is greater than the average, so the number 11 is an above average bill.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:07)
378 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:09)
595 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:10)
3132 is large, so bill number 8 is also above average.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:17)
96 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:18)
354 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:20)
And bill number 5, which is also the largest bill, is an above average bill.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:29)
Small.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:31)
And 1341, so again 3 is also an above average bill.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:36)
1525 is also an above average bill, so 2 is also an above average bill.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:41)
And 567 is small. So, in this way, we calculated the average in one iteration and then we found
the above average bills in the second iteration.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:01)
Now, the next thing that the professors do in this lecture is they try to categorize the students
according to their grades and for that for establishing the grades, they first find out the maximum
score and the minimum score, this they do in one iteration where they go card by card and find
the maximum and minimum.
You will observe that here these variables are initialized as maximum is minus 1, it is initialized
to minus 1 this is because no score can be negative, so minus 1 is indeed lesser than any possible
score. Similarly, the minimum should be initialized to a value which is greater than any possible
score which is why they have chosen 101, because the scores are for out of 100, a 101 is not
possible which is why it is a good value to initialize the minimum variable to.
Now, through the iteration they go through the cards and they find out which is the maximum
score and which is the minimum score. Once they have found the maximum and minimum what
they did is, they took this range and split it into 4 equal parts. And they assigned a grade to each
part. Now, in the second iteration they go card by card and they categorize each card as
belonging to one grade or the other, based on the marks. So, this way at the end of it all, we will
have all the cards in each grade.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:14)
Now, we will do something similar with the shopping bill data card, what we will do is we will
try to categorize these cards as low expenditure, medium expenditure, or high expenditure. For
that again let us find out the maximum bill amount and the minimum bill amount. However, we
need to be initializing these properly the maximum can be initialized to simply 0 or some
negative value, because we know that a bill amount cannot be 0, it has to be greater than 0.
However, for minimum what can we do? What is a good value for minimum? Does ideal to take
Infinity, but infinity might not be recognized number, so just to be safe I will start with a really
large number like 10000000, so we are expecting that nobody is spending 10000000 rupees in
one bill in any of these stores.
So, that is meaningful initial value for the minimization variable because we expect that
whatever is the minimum value in these shopping bills it should be definitely less than
10000000. So, let us begin with our first card, our first card is 567 which is greater than max, so
we update max to 567 and it is less than the minimum, so we update the minimum also to 567.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:04)
Now, 1525 is greater than 567, so max gets updated to 1525, whereas min does not get updated,
because 567 is smaller than 1525.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:22)
1341 is smaller than the max and larger than the min, so no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:30)
123 is smaller than max, so we are not updating max, but it is smaller than the min. Therefore,
our new minimum is a 123.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:45)
4174 is large, so the max is now 4174, there is no update in the min because this is a very large
number.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:56)
354 is smaller than the max and greater than the min, so no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:03)
96 smaller than the max, but it is also smaller than the min, therefore the minimum needs to be
updated 96.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:15)
3132 leads to no updates, it is smaller than the max and greater than the min.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:22)
595 is the same case.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:25)
378 also no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:28)
893 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:30)
186 also no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:32)
3060 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:35)
656 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:37)
229 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:38)
187 is also less than the max and greater than the min.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:44)
279 the same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:46)
603 same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:48)
592 also the same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:51)
622 the same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:53)
128 the same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:55)
315 the same thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:57)
888 is also less than the max and greater than the min.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:02)
92 is less than max so we do not update max but it is great, it is also less than the min, which
means our min needs to be updated to 92.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:14)
1364 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:17)
276 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:19)
340 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:20)
514 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:22)
106 no updates.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:25)
798 no updates, so we are now sure that this is the maximum and this is the minimum, now in
order to create our grades of shopping that is what is low, what is medium and what is high, let
us again represent these values in this way and now let us try to cut this range into 3 equal
pieces. So, what we get is each piece should be 4174 minus 92 divided by 3, this is what each
piece is size should be and this comes out to be 4082 divided by 3, which is roughly equal to
1360.67, so we can say this quantity here, this is about 1453, whereas this quantity is about 2813.
So, these are our grades, this is low, this is medium and this high bill amount. Now, let us try to
find these bills.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:08)
The categories are low is from 92 to 1453 rupees and medium would then be 1454 to 2813 and
lastly the high bill amounts would be from 2814 to 4174, which is the largest bill value. Now, we
again iterate through the cards and we start putting these cards into their respective categories.
Now, 798 is clearly low, therefore bill number 30 is in this category.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:02)
106 is also low, so 29 is also low bill amount.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:07)
So is 28.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:12)
And 27.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:17)
And 26, so lot of these cards are actually low bill amounts.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:25)
1364 is also low, so 25 is also here.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:33)
92 is really low, so card number 24 is also here.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:40)
888 it is the same thing, card number 23.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:46)
And also card number 22 because 315 is small.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:51)
128 is also small, so card number 21 is the same case.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:57)
622 is also the same case.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:00)
592 is also the same case, so card number 19.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:04)
And card number 18 is also the same boat.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:10)
So is card number 17.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:14)
And card number 16.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:19)
And card number 15.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:25)
And card number 14.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:29)
And we now have one high card which is card number 13.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:39)
And now we are back to a low card 12.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:45)
And 11.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:50)
And 10.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:56)
And 9.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:00)
Now, we have a high card again, this is 8.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:06)
Then again small 7.
(Refer slide Time: 22:11)
And 6.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:17)
5 is very large, just the highest bill amount in fact.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:22)
Now, we have 4 here.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:27)
3 also falls in the small.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:34)
2 alone is probably the only medium card.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:41)
And then we have 1 in the low cards. So, this way we have only 3 high bill amounts and only 1
medium bill amount and the remaining 26 are all low amounts. Thank you.
