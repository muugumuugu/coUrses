Operations on the data collected in three prizes problem using lists
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So, we has found when we were doing this three prize problem,
one of the things we have said was that the student who qualifies for the price must be in the top
3 in at least one subject.
Professor G. Venkatesh: At least one subject, yes.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:29)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So, we had calculated for each subject the top 3 marks in that
subject. So, in mathematics for instance there were two 97 to the top mark, one with 93, one with
89, so 97, 93 and 89 were the top 3 marks. Similarly, in physic is 92, 91, 88; chemistry it was 97,
93, 92. But what we have not recorded in this is who got these marks? So, we only know that
somebody got 92, somebody got 88.
Professor G. Venkatesh: In fact we notice that somebody who did well in chemistry, topper in
chemistry has not got very good marks in maths and physics. Topper in maths and physics had
not necessarily done, he is not the topper in chemistry, remember.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So now one question to ask is in this collection of people who
have got top 3 marks in of the subjects is there somebody who has actually managed to get not
the top mark but at least within the top 3 in all 3 subjects.
Professor G. Venkatesh: All 3 subjects which means that what does it mean; mean that student
must be, so student must be in this
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, so there is a maths set so to speak.
Professor G. Venkatesh: There is a maths set the students who got either 97, 93 or 89 that is the
maths set.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Then we have a physics set. So people who got in physics 92, 91
or 88 and then we have a chemistry set.
Professor G. Venkatesh: This is 97, 93 or 92 in chemistry.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And now we want to check whether this intersection of these 3
sets is empty or not, whether there is some student
Professor G. Venkatesh: Will be there, I suspect that at least one student will be there, may be 2.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So what will need to do is now find out
Professor G. Venkatesh: What is your guess? I think there will be 2, 3.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Maximum 1 I think, maximum 1.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Okay, will see, will find out. I think that there will be 2, let us see. So,
how do we do this? So we go through this, we know anyway these marks. So like we have to do
is filter this
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And like last time we will record the list, we will not physically
put in the index markers but will imagine that they are there. So without disturbing the thing we
will just not down in a separate thing the list of those cards. So anybody who has got now we are
doing the maths list, so maths list
Professor G. Venkatesh: So what you want we to check? 97, 93 or 89?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, anybody who has got 89, so the card number is 14.
Professor G. Venkatesh: You may keep maths in one and physics in we want to keep everything
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes it is because there are only a few which are in the top.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So 14?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 87?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 62?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 97?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Okay that is 11.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 97.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 23.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 84?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 68?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 87?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 78?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 81?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 65?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 57?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 72?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 63?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 74?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 72?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 93?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, 93 is there, 20?
Professor G. Venkatesh: So, 64?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 81?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No, so I think maybe that is a misprinted card, maybe we should
pull it out.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 71?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 87?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 62?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 74?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 44?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 62?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 52?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 56?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 42?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 76?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So, now we have come up with these 4
Professor G. Venkatesh: And I did not disturb it.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, without disturbing because the same order we just, and
actually we can validated we got it right because here according to our calculation there were 97,
97, 93, 89, should have been 4 and we have 4.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So, we have to do same process, we could have done it in one iteration
without having to do it
Professor Madhavan Mukund: But it is just, supposing we have done it at different times and
kept track of it, it is just to illustrate that.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So physics like that we can do physics also.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So we want 88 and above.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 92?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So 11.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 83.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Okay.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 7.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Okay.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 88 and above, physics 88 and above, yes 88, 88 and above.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 9.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 88 and above.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 18, 5?
Professor G. Venkatesh: Okay.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: What is the last one?
Professor G. Venkatesh: 58.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 58, okay 90 is chemistry, okay fine. And finally we have
chemistry. So chemistry we want
Professor G. Venkatesh: get the numbers 4 plus 2; 6.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 6, correct.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Chemistry we need 92 and above.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, so 14.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Yes.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 11?
Professor G. Venkatesh: 92 and above, so 97.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 18.
Professor G. Venkatesh: This is 91, 92.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 25.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 91 again, nice scores in chemistry, okay 62, 78, 90.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: There should be 1, 2, 3, 4.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Not bad, alright, good. So now what do we do? What is the question,
this is a set of all the people who scored
(Refer Slide Time: 06:17)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: The top 3, top 3 marks in maths, top 3 marks in physics, top 3
marks in chemistry.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So, we do not need the cards now, we do not need this also, this is all
we need. So, from these 3 sets we want to find out these 3, intersection of these 3 sets is null or
has something? So, what do we do it? We have to iterate, we go through this and for each of
these go through this, so it is a 3, iteration, it is a iteration my god, so one pair at a time we can
do no?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: I think so, I think we will find out those have in both maths and
physics only those need to be checked.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Make another card and do it.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So, let us do that because there is no point in looking for
somebody in all 3 if they are in 2, so first we will do maths plus physics.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So maths is intersection with physics, so it means that you go through
all the maths, so 14.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Is it there? It is not there.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 11?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, so 11 is in there, so that is okay.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 23?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 23 is there, 20 not know, so we have go two people who are in
maths plus physics.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So now you intersect that with chemistry.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So, we can
Professor G. Venkatesh: Go through the smaller list 11, so 11 is there.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So I will write M P C, so 11 is there and 23 is not here.
Professor G. Venkatesh: That is it, 23 is not there.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Say I got 1.
Professor G. Venkatesh: You got 1?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: I said at most 1, so 1 okay.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Alright, so here again this is an example of where we, if you want to
find 11 presumably can the bookmarks?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, then we just have to look for the bookmark for 11 and we
would get that card.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So we have again we wanted to find whether or not there is any
common student among these 3 sets? So we first found the first set, made a list out of it, list of
bookmarks, this two index right, indices. Physics we found the set, chemistry we found the set
and then we found the intersection through algorithm.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Without disturbing
Professor G. Venkatesh: Without disturbing, we did not disturb the cards that is the key thing.
And then we identified that there is indeed one person we can pull that person out.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Wonderful, interesting.
