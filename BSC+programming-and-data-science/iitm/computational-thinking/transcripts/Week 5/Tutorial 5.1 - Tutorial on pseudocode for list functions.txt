Tutorial on pseudocode for list functions
(Refer Slide Time: 00:25)
Hello Computational Thinking students. In this tutorial we will see pseudocodes of list functions
used by professor in the previous lecture. This is the list of all those special functions; length,
first, last, rest, init and we will also introduce a new function called member. Now we will see
the computational logic involved in each of these functions. It is possible to write function
definitions in many different ways. As we have learned earlier that the procedures with same
interface can have different implementations.

Length; is a function which counts the number of elements in a list. Therefore, it accepts a list as
a parameter and returns an integer which represents the count of elements. Here we will iterate
over the list l using this new operator called foreach. It will go through the entire list element by
element and increment the count variable. If we pass an empty list as a parameter then it will
return 0 because foreach block will not execute at all. If we observe carefully the functionality of
this for each operator is similar to the iterator logic which we use over a pile of cards or rows of
table.
So far we have used for each operator to iterate over the list and while loop to iterate over cards
or table rows. But foreach operator can also be used instead of while loop like for each x in Pile
1 or for each x in Table 1 where x holds a card or a table row.

First function accepts a list as a parameter and returns the first element in the provided list. The
return statement will terminate the execution of the foreach block while accessing the first
element itself. With this function we have to think about some boundary conditions as well like
if we pass empty list to this function, then the output is undefined because we cannot compute
first of empty list.

Last is another function which returns the last element in the provided list. Here, foreach iterates
over the elements in the list and will always update value of this variable E. Therefore when the
foreach block ends its execution variable e will hold the last value in the list. Similar to first
function if we pass an empty list to the last function then the output is undefined.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:35)
Rest is a special function which always returns a list. This list will contain all the elements from
the original list except the first element. It can also be represented as rest of l equal to l minus
first of l. In the pseudocode we will maintain an empty list called rest list which we will use to
store output of this rest function. Also we will maintain a Boolean variable found and initialize it
to false. This variable will be set to true only once when we access the first element in the list.
From there onwards we will copy all the elements from the original list to the rest list. If we pass
an empty list to this function then the foreach block will not execute and the function will return
an empty list. It will also return an empty list if we pass a list of length 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:45)
Init function returns all the elements from the original list except the last element. Hence it can
be represented as init of l equal to l minus last of l. The pseudocode is similar to rest function
except the variable prev which is used to store the value of previous element while iterating over
the list. No element will be added to the init list when variable x holds the first element of
original list. If variable x has second element of the original list then we will be adding the first
element in init list which is stored in variable prev.
The same process of adding an element will continue for all the elements of the original list
except the last because we will add the second last element of original list in the init list when
variable x has the last element of the original list. Similar like rest function, if we pass an empty
list to this function then the foreach block will not execute and the function will return an empty
list. It will also return an empty list if we pass a list of length 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:22)
Member is another special function which checks for the membership of an element in a list. It
accepts two parameters; a list and an element and returns Boolean value true or false based on
whether the input is present in the list or not. If list l contains an element e, then the function will
return true which will stop the iteration of the foreach block and member function will terminate.
If that return statement does not execute at all then it indicates that the list l does not contain the
element e. In such case for each block will complete its execution without any output and then
the default return statement will execute which will provide the output value false. Thank you for
watching this tutorial, happy learning.
