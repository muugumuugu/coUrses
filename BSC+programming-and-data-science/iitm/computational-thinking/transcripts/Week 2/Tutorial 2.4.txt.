Tutorial 2.4
Hello Computational Thinking students, in this tutorial we going to look at a procedure similar to
what the professors have done in lecture 14. In lecture 14, professors execute a procedure where
they finding the maximum revenue made by a store in the shopping bill data set.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:38)
For this they maintain a variable which they call Max, which is supposed to be the max revenue
and it is initialized to 0 and as they go card by card for every new store they encounter they
create a new variable and initialize it to 0 and that stores variable will maintain the revenue for
that store. This sum variable for each store whenever it is greater than the max variable, the max
variable is also updated to the new maximum revenue amount.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:17)
In this way, at the end of the procedure the max variable indicates the maximum revenue made
by a store in the shopping bill data set.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:29)
For our tutorial now we are going to do a very similar procedure on the words data set. In the
words data set we might like to know which part of the speech contributes most characters to the
text? This is not the same thing as which part of speech has a maximum number of words on its
count. This is about the letter count per part of speech.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:00)
For example, these are the pronouns in this text. As you can see, although there number is 7,
there letter count will be quite less. Because the words are all pretty small they just 2 letters or 3
letters. So we are trying to find out which part of speech contributes the maximum letters to this
text.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:34)
So we will go through this data card by card and every time we come across a new part of speech
we will declare variable for that part of speech initialize it to 0 and that variable will keep track
of the sum of characters for that part of speech. And before that we also have a max letter count
variable, which is initialized to 0.
This will be updated whenever any of the individual part of speech variables have a value greater
than the max value. So, let us begin here, we have the first card which is a pronoun and this is the
first time we are seeing this part of speech. So, we have a variable called pronoun later count.
This is initialized to 0 and then we increase the value to 2. Since max letter count has been
initialized to 0, 2 is greater than 0, we update our max later count to 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:42)
Going next, we have a verb. We have not seen a verb before, so we now declare and initialize
this variable to 0 and the variable is verb letter count. Now it is updated to 3, 3 being greater than
2 the max is also updated to 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:07)
We see a noun here noun is again a new part of speech. So noun letter count is declared and
initialized to 0 and now it is increased to 6. It is updated 6, which means max also has to be
updated to 6 because 6 is greater than.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:28)
Another noun and this time the letter count is 7, so the total noun letter count would be 6 plus 7,
which is 13 and 13 being greater than 6, max is also updated to 13.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:43)
One more noun and this is 11, so the total noun count total noun letter count would be 13 plus 11
that is 24. Since 24 is greater than max, max is also updated to 24.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:02)
Now this another verb. So verb letter count comes to 6, but 6 is lesser than 24 so max is not
updated.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:12)
Then we have a adjective. This is the first time you seeing an adjective. So we declare adjective
letter count and initialized it to 0 and we updated to 9.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:25)
We have a preposition which is new and so preposition letter count is declared initialized to 0
and updated to 2. This does not affect the max, of course.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:38)
One more verb so we are now at verb letter count being 10.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:44)
One more pronoun. The pronoun letter count is now 5
(Refer Slide Time: 05:50)
One more noun and the noun letter count is now 24 plus 4 that is 28. Now 28 being greater than
24 the max is also updated to 28.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:03)
This is another pronoun and the pronoun letter count is now 7.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:08)
A verb letter count will now be 10 plus 10, 20.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:14)
Another noun this time the noun letter count goes to 34 and thus the max is also updated 34.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:24)
We have an adverb which is new. So we introduce a new variable called adverb letter count. We
initialize it to 0 and then we update it to 9.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:37)
Now, we have one more adjective making the adjective letter count 19.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:42)
Then there is one preposition. The preposition letter count is now 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:48)
An article, article is new so new variable article letter count which is equal to 0 and then update
it to 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:59)
Now, this is calendar is a noun with little count 8 that gives us noun letter count this 34 plus 8,
which is 42 and this is also the new maximum.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:11)
You have a preposition now of with 5 letters. So that is proposition letter count is 9.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:20)

updated to 3.

Here as you can see the nouns are typically long words and there also a lot of them. So they
occupy maximum space that is they have the maximum letter account in this paragraph and this
maximum letter count we know to be a 145. Thank you.
