Iterations using combination of filtering conditions
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So last time we looked at this question of filtering, so we said
we would go through the cards and based on some characteristics of the cards, some property
of the card, we will decide whether it is useful or not. For instance, we looked at pronouns,
we looked at verbs we also said we could keep track of both pronouns and verbs at the same
time because something is either a pronoun or a verb. So, now let us do something more
interesting.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:41)
Professor G. Venkatesh: So I am going back to this data set, classroom data set. Now let us
say in this data set I want to find out all the girls, who not just want do I want to find out how
many girls are there, but I want to find out how many girls are there from a specific city, let
us say Chennai.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Okay.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So how many girls are from Chennai, how many Chennai girls are in
this
(Refer Slide Time: 1:01)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So there are two, so there is a gender and there is a town/city,
so there two items and what we want is this should be female and the town/city should be
Chennai.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Yeah, how would we do that, I mean is there simple way of doing
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So what we could do first is we could first separate out all the
girls, so that would be one step of filtering.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Want to try that?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yeah. So
(Refer Slide Time: 1:24)
Professor G. Venkatesh: So here is a girl, so I guess I put it in a different pile, here is also
girl, girl, girl, boy, boy, girl, girl.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Girl.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Girl, boy.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, one more girl, boy, boy, girl, boy,
boy, boy, boy, girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl. So now we have filtered this data into two piles,
everything on this pile is a boy
Professor G. Venkatesh: Not useful
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Everything there is the girl
Professor G. Venkatesh: This is one which we are interested in
(Refer Slide Time: 2:07)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Now, among the girls, we want those who are from Chennai.
So we move this aside keep it separately and now we want to go through this again look at
the town/city thing.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Yeah so
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So this is not Chennai, Bengaluru, not Chennai, this is
Chennai, this is Chennai, this is Chennai, this is Chennai, not Chennai, this Chennai, not
Chennai, not Chennai, not Chennai, not Chennai and not Chennai. So now we have pulled out
those cards which are a combination of two different interesting things for us, that they are
both girls and they are from Chennai.
Professor G. Venkatesh: And we can count this I guess. We shall 2, 3, 4, 5
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So among this entire remember we add 30 students we had
counted at the beginning, so among those we have found that there are 5 girls from Chennai.
So in this what we have done is we have done filtering in two stages, so first we have applied
a gender filter to pull out all the girls and then we have applied the city filter to pull out all
the Chennai, I guess we could have done it the other way, we could have first pulled out all
the Chennai people and look for the girls in that.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Should give the same answer, right? Because the same cards would
come out.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes
Professor G. Venkatesh: First, we should have filtered the Chennai.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yeah, but supposing we did it in a one step, can we do it in a
one single, so what I said is instead of going through and first explicitly pulling out all the
girls, and then going through all the girls and then pulling out all the Chennai people, do you
think we can just do it in one shot like we have done for some of the other iterations overlap
this thing that we could check?
Professor G. Venkatesh: We should I guess that would be I mean just go through the cards in
one iteration and at each stage you look at the card and see whether it is a female, that is not
enough.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And we also need to check
Professor G. Venkatesh: So we have to do, so you have to check two conditions. So you have
to check
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So both of them have to be true
Professor G. Venkatesh: Both of them have to be true, so it is an 
, and of two conditions,
and of two conditions, the first condition is the gender F and the second condition is this the
town/city Chennai. So if it is an and of, if both of them are true, then only we select the card
for counting we keep count I guess, so we have a count variable and so maybe we start with a
count variable to 0.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yeah. So we could do that, maybe I could do that by count
Professor G. Venkatesh: And then we go through this
(Refer Slide Time: 4:23)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So I will say, Chennai
Professor G. Venkatesh: Girl, Chennai girls equal to 0. So here is a card which is a male, so it
does not satisfy the condition.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So if it is a male we do not even have to look at the city.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Do not have to look at the city, so that is interesting. So, again here
it is a male, so do not have to look, male, male, so female now we look at the city, Trichy
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So it is not Chennai.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So again, female Teni, female Bangalore, female Madurai, female
Chennai.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So now I have to increment my count.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Increment the count, another female Chennai.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Increment again.
Professor G. Venkatesh: One more female Chennai, they all come together I guess because
you put the cards together, another female Chennai and then one more female Chennai, and
there is a female Madurai, Erode, female Nagercoil, Bangalore, male, male, male, male so the
rest I think are not cards that are useful to us, so just going through all of them.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So now basically in one
Professor G. Venkatesh: So we got the count, in one iteration we kept track of a variable
called Chennai girls and we kept incrementing that variable provided that both the conditions
were satisfied, it is 
 of two conditions, gender being female and the city being Chennai.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So this is a very useful thing now, so we know that we can
take the entire stack of data or sequence of data or cards whatever we want and we can pull
out those which are interesting based on some property, in this case it was the city, for
example if it was the shopping bills it could be based on whether the total is bigger than
something and they have bought at certain type of item, in the case of the words for instance
it could have been if it is a noun and it is more than five letters long, so we can take various
combinations of conditions and filter on them simultaneously.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Is there something bit more interesting we can do, for example, can
we find all those people who are born between one date and other date?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yeah, let us try that, so let us see if we can find all people who
are born in the first half of the year, say between 1st January and 30th June.
Professor G. Venkatesh: It should be half, we do not know.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: We do not know, but let us see, is it true that, let us see.
Professor G. Venkatesh: It should be half, I mean if it is random it would be half, but this
may not be random
(Refer Slide Time: 6:46)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So let me keep track of a count for this, so this is
Professor G. Venkatesh: So here we are actually now not checking against two of these
fields, we are checking one field only, we are checking the date but now we are comparing
the date, we have two
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So we could still do two, so we could say for male and for
female, so we can say they should be born in the first half and they are male born in the, so
how many boys were born in the first half of the year, how many girls
Professor G. Venkatesh: Girls are born in the first half. So to check whether it is the first half
the date has to be, so if it is 22 July is it first half or it is not first half?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: It is not first half.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So anything should be up to June 30th.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So which means that it should be
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So we should first check the date.
Professor G. Venkatesh: It should be more than 1st January or equal to, more than or equal to
1st January and less than or equal to 30th of June.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: That is right.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So that is what it means. So let us check this this is, so this is 22
July, so does not meet the criteria. 4th March
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, and it is
Professor G. Venkatesh: It meets the criteria because it is greater than its between 1st of
January and 30th of June, so it is in that space
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And it is a male.
Professor G. Venkatesh: And it is a male.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So I will increment the male count by 1.
Professor G. Venkatesh: The Next one is 17th of September, so again in the second half. 30th
of August
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 2nd half.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 2nd half because it is greater than
Professor Madhavan Mukund: After June.
Professor G. Venkatesh: After 30th of June. 6th May this one lies between 1st of January and
30th of June.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And it is a male.
Professor G. Venkatesh: We should count it, it is a male, so it should go to the male one. 13th
October again is in the second half. 3rd June is before 30th of June so should be in the first
half male. 4th Jan, again male, looks like there are more males. 14 December
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So no, 30th December no, 7th November no, 30th April male.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So that is now 5.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 26 December male, 13th May, so first time me got a female, 13th
May first half. 17th July
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No, too late.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Again no, 9th October
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 10th September.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 12th Jan.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Female, 16th May again, female.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 8th February female, 14th Jan female, 5th May female, wow, 17th
November, so this does not count, 15th March
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So I am running out of space I am moving to the left, so I will
say 7 now.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 22nd September.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 23rd July.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: No.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 23rd March.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, so male now goes to 6.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 15th March, again male.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Male goes 7.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 28th February male.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Okay, 8.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 6th December does not count. So what do we get?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So of the 30 students, 8 males were born in the first half, 7
females. So, roughly half the students, actually exactly half
Professor G. Venkatesh: 15
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 15 of them were born in the first half
Professor G. Venkatesh: This is not bad.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Which is surprising and off that since we have an odd number
of 15 is roughly equal, 8 males and 7 females. So this is a very equally
Professor G. Venkatesh: Looks like a balanced, looks like a very balanced data.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So this is interesting, so now so basically so you can filter on
multiple things at the same time and then when you are filtering on multiple things you can
also keep track of them separately. So we have two conditions, when they were born and
whether they are male or female and based on the combination we have one count for males
born in the first half, one count for females born in first half.
Professor G. Venkatesh: And we have used the same pattern, we have used the iterator
pattern, initial values of so we kept two variables, male female born first half variable count,
that is a count so we have two variables that we are keeping track and going through the
iteration each time filtering on the gender as well as the date of birth and checking whether
the date of birth field falls between two values, 1st of January and 30th of June, inclusive and
if it falls then we add to the male count or the female count, that is what we have done. So it
is just an iteration pattern with a filter added.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So filtered iteration, very good. So let us do something more
interesting with this set, so here we have the maths marks highlighted and earlier we
computed the average marks for the whole class but supposing I wanted to find out as a
teacher who is better in general in the class, are the girls doing better in maths or the boys are
doing better in maths. So what would be a good way to look at it, should we look at the
highest marks maybe the which
Professor G. Venkatesh: I am not very sure about that, highest marks because there could be
one exceptional boy let us say, but you know the girls could general be doing better than the
boys, but only one exceptional boy may be there and just by looking at the maximum you
will biasing it by looking at this exceptional boy candidate. So I do not think we should look
at the maximum.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So then, if you want to look at the general trend I guess
average is as good as
Professor G. Venkatesh: Average is, average should work I think, if you find the average of
the boys and the average of the girls and compare it, if the average of the girls is higher,
which I think is likely than the boys, then the girls are doing better, this is what I would think
is right way of doing that.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So, we saw how to compute the average, we have to find out
how many cards there are and then we have to add up the marks across those cards and divide
by the number of cards but now we have to separate the cards, we have to filter the cards into
those for the boys and those for the girls.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So we are doing total, we are trying to find the total average total
marks for boys.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: For maths total.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Maths total, we are checking which, whether girls are doing better
than boys in maths?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: In maths, yes.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So we can find the average maths marks for girls, average maths
marks for boys and compare the two, that is what we want to do. So simple way would be to
simply separate the boys from the girls, and then find the average for each set like we did last
time, last time we did the average for the whole set
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So we filter it out into two sets boys and girls
Professor G. Venkatesh: Boys and girls
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Then we process the boys separately
Professor G. Venkatesh: Boys separately find the average, girls separately find the average
and compare the average.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So why do we need to separate them, why cannot we just do it
as we are going along, so surely like we said we did it earlier, we can keep track of all these
things in one single iteration, so we could keep track of the
Professor G. Venkatesh: We need to keep track of to keep to find average of the boys, what
we need we need the total mathematics marks of only the boys and we need to find the total
number of boys and then if you divide the total mathematics marks of the boys by the total
number of boys that gives you the average for the boys. Similarly, for the girls you have find
the total mathematics marks of the girls and find the total number of girls and then divide the
total mathematics marks of girls by the total number of girls that will give the average for the
girls.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So we have to keep track
Professor G. Venkatesh: So we see it looks like we keep track of 4 things.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:49)
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So let me just write it down, so we need say let me just break
up this space into four things, so we need say the boy count
Professor G. Venkatesh: We need the boy count.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And of course we need the girl count. So this will tell us how
many of each there are and then we will keep track of the boys sum and the girls sum.
Professor G. Venkatesh: And we are going to do all of it in one iteration, as we go through
the cards
Professor Madhavan Mukund: As we go through in one iteration.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So here there is some filtering going on because we are looking at
whether it is a boy or a girl and then doing the so these few things
Professor Madhavan Mukund: And then this, and then use accumulation because
Professor G. Venkatesh: Accumulation because we are adding the mathematics marks and
then we are counting, so we are counting, accumulating, filtering all together in one shot, so
let us try it. So here is the first card, this is a boy
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So boy is now count is 1.
Professor G. Venkatesh: And mathematics is 72.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So the sum is now 72.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Second one is a girl.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Girl count is 1.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Girl count is 1 and 74 is the maths marks. Third one is again a boy,
count
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Count is 2.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Maths is 81.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So 72 plus 81 is 153.
Professor G. Venkatesh: The next card is a male again boy
Professor Madhavan Mukund: 3.
Professor G. Venkatesh: 74 is the maths marks.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So that is 227.
Professor G. Venkatesh: The next is girl and 62 is the maths marks.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So it is 136.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So here is a fantastic maths mark by a girl who is getting 97.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So that is 233.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So here is a boy who is not doing that well, maths mark 44.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So that is 271.
Professor G. Venkatesh: We can do like this we can go through the whole set I guess.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So at the end we would have got some total.
Professor G. Venkatesh: We have got a total, so we have gone through the whole list now,
what do we get?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So I think the whole list there were 17 boys and 13 girls and
the sum of the boys was 1220 and the sum of the girls was 951. So now what we wanted to
do was find the average
Professor G. Venkatesh: Average.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: So we need to divide, so if we actually divide the left hand
side you get some 71.76 and this is some 73.15, so 1220 divided by 17, 71.76, 951 divided by
13 is 73.15.
Professor G. Venkatesh: So it looks like the girls are doing marginally better than the, not that
much 73.15 is just a little bit more than 71.76, so the girls are doing better but one, could not
because it is small number 13 and so on you cannot really say much, but slightly marginally
better than the boys.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: But what is interesting is that we were able to do this now in
one scan, so we were able to iterate this set of cards once and keep track of these four
outputs
Professor G. Venkatesh: Four variables.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: As we were going along, so we were kind of doing a filtering
on the gender in this case and we were accumulating both the number of cards of that gender
and the maths marks total of that gender and finally we got all the totals and we were able to
then
Professor G. Venkatesh: So would you say that I mean we had this original question, are the
girls doing better than boys, which seem like very interesting question, I mean it is kind of
question that we normally ask but we have been able to turn that into a procedure, an iterator
with some filtering and some variables and keeping track and all that and we have been able
to give an answer which is numerically
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yes, that we can justify.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Justify, so would you say that this is an algorithm that we have been
able to take this problem, are girls doing better than boys and we have found an algorithm for
it, would you describe it like that?
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Yeah, that is a good way of thinking about it, so we have taken
a question which is say subjective which you can debate about and we have given a
systematic procedure on using the data available and a way to calculate and either confirm or
to deny the hypothesis. So if we assume that girls are doing better than boys, then this is one
way to validate whether this is true or not true, so that is true so this is very interesting that
you can actually take a question which looks somewhat vague and make it precise by giving a
criterion for that and giving an algorithm to compute that.
Professor G. Venkatesh: Okay.
Professor Madhavan Mukund: Very good.
