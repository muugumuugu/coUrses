Seventh question, as a gardener who collected data on the rates per kg of tomato, sold in
different seasons. So, these are the data points which are 12, 16, 22, 8, 36, 34, 40 and 28. Then
the question which of these 3 box plots correctly represents the gardener
s data.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:50)
So, for this we have to first understand what a box plot is, so the box plot is called number of
things, so it is called a box plot or box and whiskers plot or also candle sticks chart, these are
the various names given to the plot, and it is essentially a chart a plot to represent the five
number summary. So, in the five-number summary what do we do we have something which
is the minimum of the data, then we have the first quartile, then we have the second quartile
and then we have the third quartile and finally we have the maximum of that data.
Let us imagine some data where the minimum is let us say 3. And the maximum is let us say
42 and the Q1 is occurring at suppose 10, Q2 is occurring at suppose 19, Q3 is occurring at
suppose 27. So, this is how the data is, we have found the five numbers summary of this data
suppose. Now, for the box plot we first establish this markings vertically like this letters in this
ruler, let us consider this is 0, this is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45.
So, this is how the ruler is 0 is here and 45 is here, so what we do in a box plot is we draw a
box a rectangular box from the Q3 to Q1 so Q1 to Q3 we draw a rectangular box which looks
like this. So, here we can see that the upper part of the box is Q3 and the lower part of the box
is Q1 10 to 27. So, this is basically nothing but the interquartile range Q1 to Q3 is the
interquartile range and we are basically showing a box to represent the interquartile range.
So, this is why we call it the box plot and the whiskers part is that along with this box we also
draw a vertical line from the Q3 to the max here which is 42 and here we mark it of like this.
And we do the same thing on the other end from Q1 to the minimum which is 3, so here this is
to 3 so this is our minimum and this is 42 which is our maximum. So, in this way the min is
shown the max is shown the Q1 and Q3 are shown and what is left is the Q2 which is also
incidentally the median.
So, to indicate the median what we do is we draw this little line that is going through the box.
So, this is our 19 which is Q2 which is also the median because Q2 is exactly 50 percentile
which is a median of the data. And this plot is what is called your box plot or box and whiskers
plot or sometimes even the candle sticks plot because it looks like a candle stick. Now, given
this introduction, let us go to the question and see how to solve it.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:00)
So, since it is box plot we need to first rearrange our data as a ascending order we need to
arrange the data so we will have 8 first 8 goes first, 12 appears to be next, 16 as after that, 22
comes after that, 28 is here and we have 32, 34, 36 and 40 so overall the 9 observations. So,
first of all which box plot has a range of 8 to 40, so this box plot does not seem to be starting
from 0 because this appears to be 5 units this length and this is even lessees on 5 units.
So, maybe this value is probably 7 and then 8 is likely to come about here, so all of these box
plots seem to match that the upper limit the other side of the range is 40 for these two. So,
either of these two could be our box plot and this one is definitely wrong. Now, let us look at
the interquartile range, so we have 9 points we have seen. So, the interquartile range will come
from if we did it exactly by as 25 percent, we would get from 2.25 to 6.75 and that means from
the third value to the seventh value which is this.
So, 16 into 34 should be shown in our interquartile range. And that is happening for this box
plot so this is about at 16 and this is at 34, so this is wrong and this is our correct box plot.
