So, I read question. Preeti found the following ages of 8 tigers. So, these are the 8 ages Preeti has
found they were selected randomly from 20 tigers at her local zoo, and the value of the standard
deviation is being asked. Now this is clearly sample standard deviation, so we need to first find
the mean, the mean, 
 would be 5 + 9 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 3 + 5 + 1, the whole divided by 8, which
gives us 5 + 9 is 14, 14 plus that 13 is 27, 27 + 15 is 42, 42 + 17 is 59, 59 + 3 is 62, 62 + 5 is 67
plus 1 is 68.
So, we are getting 68/8 which is 8.5. This is our mean. Now, if you look at the deviations of each
of these, because we as first going to have to calculate the variance, or we can calculate the standard
deviation directly is the square root of the sum of the squares of the deviations. Here, I have used
the 
 minus xi deviation is actually xi - 
 , but since we are squaring, it really does not matter the
sign should not matter. So, we can go on like this. Then I goes from 1 to 8 here divided by 7
because it is sample standard deviation.
So, this we will get as square root of the whole thing by 7 in 2. Now, we will get 3.52 + 0.52 + 4.52
+ 6.52 + 8.52 + 5.52 + 3.52 + 7.52.

So, this gives us then the #
which further gives us
square root of this denominators to the 7 the numerator will give us 12.5 + 2.25 is 32.75 plus 42.25
is 75 plus 72.25 is 147.25 plus 30.25 is 177.5 plus 12.25 is 189.75 plus 36.25 is 246, which is
roughly the square root of 35.143 which is again roughly 5.928. So, this is the standard deviation
of the ages of these tigers, sample standard deviation of course.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:28)
So, our answer is 5.928 years.
