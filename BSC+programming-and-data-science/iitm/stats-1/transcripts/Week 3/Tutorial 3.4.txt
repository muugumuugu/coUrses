For our fourth question, we are told that the mean of 25 observations is 36 and the mean of the
first 13 observations is 32 and the last 13 observations is 39, which means the thirteenth
observation must be included in both of the calculations. Because, so we have observations, let us
call them 
1 , 
2 , 
3 , so on and look at the 
13 one, it comes right in the middle and then we have till
25 .
So, the first 13 would include these and the mean is 32. The last 13 would include these and the
mean is 39, so this particular term is there in both calculations. So, what we get from these three
different pieces of information is, when you talk about all 25 put together, the mean is 36. So, that
means the total sum
= 36.
Then we also know that
= 32 and
=13 
= 39. So, in case you are confused about what
this 
i going from something to something let us call this m to n ti means, this is basically the 
implies a summation so you are adding things. And what are you adding?
You are adding 
s, where the i variable goes from m to n. So, that would be 
 plus because you
are starting from m and everything on the way till n so, 
+1 + 
+2 +. . . +
 , this is what
the summation notation indicates.

So, in this particular first case what we are basically saying is 
1 + 
2 + 
3 +. . . +
25, that is what it
means, where i goes from 1 to 25.
3 +...+
 = 25
 36 = 900
And now from the second piece of information we get that
 , that is the sum of the first 13 terms is so what is the mean, the mean is 32, so
 = 13
 32 = 416.
And this portion, the last one where 
=13 
 = 13 times because a 13 observation overall into 39,
this is the given mean, so this is essentially 507.
=13 
 = 507
(Refer Slide Time: 4:40)
So, now what we have is the sum of the first 25 terms is there, sum of the first 13 terms is there
and sum of the last 13 terms is there. So, if I added these two, this and this, I will get
=13 
 = 416 + 507 = 923.
However, these two put together are basically 
13 which is because our 
13 is showing up
once in both of these summations.
Therefore, when I combine them one 
13 goes into the total summation and the other extra is lying
here, so this is going to give us 923 and this sum, the total sum we know is 900 which means 900
13 = 923 and that indicates that 
13 = 923 
 900 = 23.
