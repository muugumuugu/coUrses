In our sixth question, we have Rajan just took his first math test in his college analysis class. His
professor says he scored the eightieth percentile and Rajan
s professor posts a list of grades without
names. The 12 students, these are the grades, these are the marks actually not grades, but anyway.
So, what is Rajan
s mark? So, there are 12 students and the eightieth percentile would indicate 80
percent of 12, so if I can sell this with 4 I will get 25 with for 4 I will get 3, 55 and 5 16.
So, I get 48/5, which is equal to 9.6. So, obviously you cannot be the 9.6 person in a class. So, you
taken to be the tenth guy, that is in our case we have to order these now. So, in this we will first
go look at the smallest value 38 is the smallest followed by 46 which is the second smallest. Then
we have a 55 which is the third smallest and then there is 60 the fourth. Sixty sixth the fifth, 68 is
the sixth. 70 is the seventh, 75 is the eighth, 78 is the nineth and 84 is the tenth, 85 is eleventh and
93 is of twelfths. So, 84 is our tenth value. So, this implies Rajan scored 84.
