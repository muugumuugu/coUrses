Probability 
 Basic Definitions
(Refer Slide Time: 00:24)
So having learned about permutations and combinations, we now move on to learn about the
fundamentals of probability. So what are we expected to learn in the next two weeks is, we
are going to first understand what we mean by uncertainty. And we will understand about a
very important concept that is random experiment.
Now, the concept of random experiment and what are events, sample spaces, events these are
extremely important in our understanding of probability. We then move forward to
understand what is the notion of simple event and compound event, we will introduce the
basic laws of probability.
We will spend some time to compute the probability of events through visual representations
which we call tree diagrams. Then, a very important notion of conditional probability is
introduced. Because we need the notion of conditional probability to define what we finally
know, distinguish or to distinguish between what we refer to as independent events and
dependent events.
We will also solve applications of probability throughout the module. So, these are, this is
what you should be knowing at the end of these two weeks, which we have devoted to
understand the concepts of probability.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:56)
Now, let us move forward and understand what, how to set up this formal definition of
probability. Every time we hear things like this that there is a 50% chance that India will win
a toss when you have captains who go for a toss at the beginning of a game, say the game of
cricket. Usually, they toss the coin and the captains decide whether they want to field first or
bat first.
So, we always say when there is a toss of a coin, there is a chance of the person winning the
toss of a coin, typically we assign a 50% chance of a person will or a country would win a
toss. In the, if we do not know the answer to a multiple choice question, most of the times we
guess an answer. Suppose I guess an answer A, then afterwards I want to say that okay, this
guess I do not know whether what I have guessed is the right answer or not.
Similarly, when we come to elections there is always we hypothesize or we say that a party
would probably win the next election. Similarly, we have also heard statements of the kind
that there is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow. Now, when you look at these statements, you
always see that in the first statement, there was something called a chance that we are talking
about. Again, my guess probably win chance of rain. So what we see immediately is that
there is an element of uncertainty.
What do we mean by this element of uncertainty? We are not sure that are certain that India
will win a toss. India could win, could not win. So the outcome is uncertain. I am not
confident that answer A is the right choice. I am guessing, whenever I guess I am not certain.
The uncertainty element is there. Similarly, we are not sure, we are not certain that party
ABC will win the next election. We are probably it would win the next election.
Similarly, I am just telling that there could be a chance of rain. Am I certain it would rain
tomorrow? The answer is no. I am just saying there could be a chance of rain and I am
quantifying that chance with a 30% chance. So, we routinely keep hearing claims of this kind,
where we are addressing this element of uncertainty.
So, why do we need to learn about this here? Remember when we talked in our descriptive
statistics module, you said that we have a larger subset or larger set which we refer to as a
population. We refer to the smaller set, subset of a population as a sample. And, I said I want
to draw valid inferences about this larger set using this smaller subset.
So, if I want to draw valid inferences about a population from a sample, I need to know how
likely it is that certain events will occur under certain circumstances. So, if I am want to
move from my descriptive statistics which we learned in our first module to inferential
statistics which you will be learning in your second course.
I need certain tools to capture the uncertainty that would manifest here and that uncertainty
that is the determination of the likelihood or chance that an event will occur is what is the
subject matter or what we refer to as probability. Hence, if I have to go from this to this, I
need to understand probability and that is what we are going to do in the next two weeks. We
are going to set up the foundation because this is again remember a foundational level course.
We are going to set up this foundation which will help you understand inferential statistics.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:18)
So, we start this foundation by setting up the building blocks of help in create this framework.
Now what is an experiment? An experiment is any process that produces an observation or
outcome at monitoring the time taken to, for example, if I am just monitoring the time taken
to measure, Okay, certain output from us certain machines, Okay, or if I am measuring the
diameter of nuts or diameter of bolts which are produced by a certain machine.
This is my experiment because it is producing an observation. What is the observation? I am
measuring a particular diameter, Okay. Now, I can define an experiment as a process that
produces any observation or outcome. Now, if I conduct an experiment in a completely
controlled setup.
For example, I am just having two people; let me call this as person A and this is person B
and I give each one of them a glass of water, same identical glass of water and I asked them
to add a spoon of sugar to the glass of water. Same amount of water, identical, and asking
them to add a spoon of sugar and ask them to stir it, we would expect both the outcomes to be
the same because we are having exactly the controlled experiment.
Both of them are given the same type of glass, everything is similar. I am asking them to just
add a spoon of sugar. Sugar is also same. Everything is absolutely identical, same. They are
just mixing it. I would expect the both the outcomes to be the same. Now let us repeat another
experiment. This is an experiment because it is a process, it is producing an observation.
What is observation it is producing? I am mixing water and salt.
So I am seeing what is the outcome, it is going to be a mixture of sugar and water this is what
I am mixing. Now suppose I give both of them 1 rupee coin, okay I am giving both of them a
1 rupee coin and I am asking them to toss the coin, that is each one of them gets identical 1
rupee coin and both of them are asked to do the experiment of tossing a coin.
So, when you toss a coin, you have an outcome of the experiment. Now when I toss a coin,
now, in this case, I cannot expect the same outcome from both. So cannot expect same
outcome, even though they are in the same setup, identical setup, identical coin, identical
force, thrust everything given to them, we cannot expect the same outcome.
So, in the first case, it is a some sort of a deterministic experiment, whereas in the second
case, because my outcome is uncertain when I toss a coin, I do not know which of the
outcomes would come. So, when it toss a coin, I know, I could either get a head or a tail in a
coin. I know the outcomes, but I do not know whether it would be a head or a tail.
So the uncertainty is which of the outcomes is actually going to happen. It is not a random
experiment. It is not an experiment with unknown outcomes. Here, I know what are my
outcomes. In this experiment, I know my outcome is either a head or a tail but the uncertainty
is whether it is a head or tail.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:05)
So, we formally define what is a random experiment as an experiment whose outcome is not
predictable with uncertainty or the outcome is uncertain. So, this is an extremely important
understanding. So, here I want to qualify it. The outcome of the experiment is known in
advance. So, when I am tossing a coin, I know it would be a head or a tail. But I do not know
whether it would actually be a head or tail, though two possible outcomes I know what are
the possible outcomes, but I do not know whether it would be actually a head or a tail.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:53)
So, now let us look at examples of a few random experiments. Suppose, my experiment is
guessing answer to a four option multiple choice question. Let my options be A, B, C, D. The
possible outcomes of this experiment are I have A, B, C, and D. Those are the possible
outcomes because the experiment is guessing answer. I just have four possible answers
because it is a four option multiple choice question. So, my outcomes are A B, C, D, where
these are my options.
Order of finishing a race with 6 students, I have A, B, C, D, E, F. By order of finish I am, I
mean that for example, one order of finishes, A comes first, B comes second, C comes third,
D comes forth, E comes fifth and F comes sixth. This is one order of finish. Another order of
finish is, B comes first, A comes second, C comes third, D comes forth, E comes fifth and F
comes sixth. This is another order of finish.
So, the experiment is to actually note down what are the order of finish is when I have 6
students? What are the possible ways the order of finish can happen? So, we can see that this
is one particular order, this is another particular order. We quickly recognize that this is
nothing but the number of ways you can arrange the six people.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:52)
So my total number of outcomes is nothing but I can list all possible permutations of A, B, C,
D, E, and F. Those are my possible outcomes of the experiment where I need the order of
finish. Now, why is this a random experiment? Because when six people are competing in a
race, I do not know who is going to come first or second. There is an element of uncertainty.
We do not know who is going to come first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, there is an
element of uncertainty.
Any one of them could come first or second or any of the positions. So, the outcome is all
possible permutations of the 6 students who are named A, B, C, D, E, F. Now, suppose I toss
two coins, I am tossing two coins. So, what are the possible outcome? I have my first coin. I
have my second coin.
So, the possible outcome is I have a head on my first coin a head on my second coin. I have a
head on the first coin, a tail on my second coin. A tail in my first coin, a head in my second
coin. A tail in my first coin and a tail in the second coin. These are the possible outcomes of
the experiment of tossing both the coins together.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:33)
So, I can represent that as HH, HT, TH and TT. Now, suppose the experiment is to measure
the lifetime in hours. So, if, if a bulb is lasting even for 30 minutes, I will say that it is lasting
for zero hours, if it is lasting for 1 hour, 30 minutes, I says that it has lasted for 1 hour. So that
is how we are measuring the lifetime of a bulb. So, what are the possible outcomes? It could
last for 0 hours, or 1 hour or 2 hour or 3 hours, I can keep going. So it could be 0 hours, 1
hour, 2 hours or 3 hours.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:19)
It could be any amount of time. So, it is 0 or 1 hour or 2 hours or so on. These are the
possible outcomes. I do not know how long a bulb is going to last. It could last for 30
minutes, 45 minutes, in which case my outcome is, I am going to record it as a 0 hour. If it
lasts for or it depends, if it, if I decide that anything less than 1 hour, I will record as 1 hour.
Anything less than 2 hours, between 1 hour and 2 hours, I would record as 2 hours. It would
be 30 minutes is 1 hour. It depends on how you are defining this convention. So, you can see
that the outcome again is uncertain. It is a random experiment because I do not know how
long would any light bulb last. It could be anything between 1 hour, 2 hours, 40 hours, 45
hours, we do not know. So, it was a random experiment with whatever is the outcome.
Similarly, let us go to the next experiment. The next experiment we are going to look at is the
experiment where I am throwing a dart. So, suppose I have a unit square here. For example, if
I am having an unit square, this is the point 0, 0; this is the point 1, 0; this is a point 0, 1; this
is my X axis, this is my Y axis and this is a point 1, 1. I am throwing a dart and I assume that
this dart is going to actually land within the square.
Now, the dart could land at this position, it could land at this position, it could land anywhere.
So, there is an uncertainty as to where this dart actually lands. So, if I am if my experiment is
to throw a dart and my outcome is to note down, the observations I am going to note down is
where it is actually landing in this unit square. So, that is my observation so where it lands.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:22)
So, any point in this square is a possible outcome to the random experiment. Why is it
random? I know it would be any point in the square but I really do not know which of these
points in this square would be the actual outcome. So, these are examples of random
experiments. You can see that they are random because I am guessing order of finish is not
known. When I am tossing a 2 coin, it could be either head or tail. Measuring lifetime, it
could be anything. There is an element of uncertainty.
Similarly, when I am throwing a dart in a unit square, it could be any point in the unit square.
So, these are some examples of random experiments. Now, when you look at these examples,
here I had a finite, so A, B, C, D only four choices, they were discrete finite. Whereas here, I
can writing it as 0, 1, 2. You can see that again, when I am recording it as 0, 1, 2 and so on
again discrete choices, and I am recording it as hours, but it is infinite.
Now again, when I look at this point in the square, I am recording it as a coordinate. Again,
there are infi... countable, but there are many points in this square. So immediately, you see
that I need to have a way to represent all the outcomes of this random experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:07)
And, the formal way to do it is through what we define as a sample space. So, some books
use the notation omega to represent a sample space, I am just going to use the notation S,
because it is a collection or set of all basic outcomes of a random experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:33)
Now, what do we mean by basic outcomes? The basic outcomes are all possible outcomes of
a random experiment which should be mutually exclusive. By mutually exclusive I mean that
only one not the outcome can occur. So when I am tossing a coin, the outcomes are head or a
tail, these are the 2 possible outcomes. If a head occurs, a tail cannot occur; if a tail occurs, a
head does not occur. So, this is what we refer to as a basic outcome.
For example, if I roll a die, die you all know what is a die. So, this has one dots here, it might
have 3 dots here, it has 4 dots here, it might have 2 dots here and this is a die. So, the
possible, when I roll a die whatever turns up on the top is what I record as my observation. It
could be either a 1 or a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or a 5 or a 6. So, one of the basic outcomes will occur, I
represent this by my sample size.
So when a toss a coin, my S is represented by head, tail, when a roll a die, I have a sample
space. This is for tossing a coin. When I roll a die, I have sample space which can take the
values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. And it is exhaustive in the sense that when I roll a die, one of these
outcomes have to occur. When I toss a coin one, it should either be a head or tail. So, this
collection or the set of all basic outcomes of a random experiment is defined to be what we
refer to as a sample space.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:34)
So, now let us go back to the experiments which we have seen earlier and represent them now
as sample space. Recall sample space is a set of all outcomes of my experiment. So guessing
answers, the sample space is going to be I have 4 outcomes so A, B, C, D I represent S equal
to A, B, C, D. Order of finish I have, so now, my sample space is going to be ABCDEF
which is one order of finish. ABDCEF, this is another order of finish. ABDCFE, so forth all
possible and I know my n=6 here. So, I have 6! permutations which are possible.
So, my sample space is going to have a total of 6! elements which I can represent as
ABCDEF. The dots represent all the other. I am not listing all the 6! elements here. Or I can
write it as all possible permutations, 6! permutations of my A, B, C, D, E, and F form my
sample space in this case.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:12)
Now, let us go on to the next example. So, I again have 2 coins. So, my sample space is, I can
either have a head-head; head in my first toss, head in the second toss or head in the first
coin, head in the second coin, head in the first coin, tail in the second coin, tail in the first
coin, head in the second coin and tail in the first and tail in the second. So, I can represent my
sample space of this experiment in this way, HH, HT, TH and TT.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:44)
Now measuring the lifetime, I said it could be a 0 hour, it could be a 1 hour. So, I can express
this as x where
. And, this would actually I can, I know that this is either a
0 hour or a 1 hour or a 2 hour, it is less than infinity, sorry, okay.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:11)
The next thing is when I throw a dart, I have already told you that this is going to be my X
axis Y axis, this is going to be the square. If I represent my cord
 points in the square using
my coordinates of the X, Y could include my boundary points also. So, my S is going to be
the set of all ordered coordinate points such that
That is what is my sample space where the sample space is nothing but all the points which
are enclosed within the square. So, given, if we are, so if we encounter any situation with
uncertainty, we need to understand what is the experiment, what are we observing, we need
to know how to list down the sample space and the how to rep
we need to know how to
represent the sample space.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:23)
So, what have we learned so far? The main thing is we are learned what is a random
experiment. The second thing we have learnt is what is a sample space and, we can list a
sample space is nothing but the set of all basic outcomes of a random experiment, okay. So
that is what we have learned. Now what is the next building block? So the first building block
is the notion of a random experiment. And once we have the notion of a random experiment
we understood what was the sample space.
