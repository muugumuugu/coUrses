An engineering college hostel has 20 rooms and two beds per room. There are 20 civil
engineering students, 20 computer science students who are allotted to these rooms. Pairing is
done at random, what is the probability that there is no civil and computer engineer roommate
pair?
So, all the civil engineering students are in 10 separate rooms and all the computer science
students are in 10 separate rooms. So, for solving this problem let us look at the rooms which are
like this, each room has two beds so on and there are 20 rooms all together and there are 40
students, there 20 in computer science and 20 in civil and we are looking at the total possibilities.
So, the first room gets 40C2 ways of being filled. Then the next one has 38C2 and the next one will
have
C2 so on till we are left with 2C2, so we have 4C2
basically
ways of being able to fill these rooms.

. So, this will give us
.. 2C2 which is
. So, this is the total
Now, imagine if we filled separately 10 rooms with just the civil engineering students and again
separately 10 rooms with just the computer science students. Then we will get a very similar
logic for both of these. You will get
for these and
for these as well.
However, how we choose the rooms also should matter. So, we will be getting
C10.
After these rooms are chosen, these are the ways that they respectively get filled. And then this

. This gives us the simplification would be
