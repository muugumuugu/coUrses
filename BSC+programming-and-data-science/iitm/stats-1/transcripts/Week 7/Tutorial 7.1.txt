Hello statistics students. In this week's tutorials we look at problems related to probability. In this
problem they are saying Arushi wants to set a password containing three digits followed by four
letters and then they are asking what is the probability that she will choose the first two letters as
vowels and the later two letters as consonants. Repetition of letters and numbers is not allowed.
So, the first thing we realize here is there is no condition which is set on the digits, so the digits
are as good as not being there. So, we are only interested in the four letters. So, we will look at
the probability regarding these four letters and here you want a vowel, this is also a vowel, this is
a consonant, this is a consonant and there is no repetition.
So, let us see for the first box to get a vowel the probability would be
this vowel, the one in the first box should not come up, so we get
. Now, in the next box
because one letter is taken
away and then we have 24 letters left but these are consonants now, so you have 21 consonants
here and lastly this would be 20 consonants remaining divided by 23.
So, this calculation is what we are supposed to do, if we can cancel out some things let us try
is 24 and
is 25 so
is 20 again, so two 2 two 3 two 1 and there is 13 so you will
now get, actually we can further cancel three 1 and this is 7. So, you now get
which is roughly equal to 0.02341 so this is the probability.
which is equal
