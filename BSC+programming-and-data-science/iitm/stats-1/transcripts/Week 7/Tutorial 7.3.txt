In this question there is a circular dart board radius is , and a player wins if she hits the
central rectangle, so there is a rectangle at the center and the dimensions are and .
Counting only the cases where the dart hits the board, what is the probability that the player
wins? So, a dart board is something like this and the radius is given to be r and then they are
saying there is a central rectangle which if the dart hits the player wins.
And this rectangle
s dimensions, this is , the breath is and the length is . So, the sample
space here is the total circle. So, our denominator will be the area of the total circle which is
and the specific condition we are looking for is hitting the center which is this area, just
the rectangle
s area and that comes out to be , so this should be the probability of winning.
