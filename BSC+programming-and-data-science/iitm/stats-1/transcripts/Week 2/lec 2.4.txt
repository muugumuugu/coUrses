Describing Categorical Data - Best Practices While Graphing Data - 2

Now whenever we come to display a data there is a fundamental rule called the area principle.
Now, what is this area principle actually tell us. When we look at the area principle the area
principle states that the area occupied by a part of the graph should correspond to the amount of
data it represents. What do we mean by this?
(Refer Slide Time: 00:42)
You can look at the first thing is when I have charts which are decorated to attract attention. For
example let us look at this particular chart now what this chart gives us is the total wine exports
in the United States value in millions of dollars. Now this is more like a infographic, but what
does this tell? It tells us United Kingdom is about 150.3, Canada is 146.8, Japan is 82.8, Italy is
42.5 and Netherlands is 34.4.
You can immediately see that there is no baseline, it show bottles on top of label boxes. Now
even the boxes are not of any uniform shape they are of various shapes and sizes. So, when you
look at this chart it does not convey anything which is actually I can make a meaning out of.
Whatever I need to convey is just a total US wine exports to each one of these countries and I
can construct this using a bar chart where my categories are again United Kingdom, Canada,
Japan, Italy and Netherlands.
I have labeled each one of my categories. I can see that United Kingdom has a value in 150.3
million dollars, Canada is about 146.8 million dollars, 82.8 to Japan, 42.5 to Italy and 34.4 to
Netherlands. Now the chart on the right hand side obeys what we call the area principle. It is
accurate, it has a baseline this is the baseline of this chart. So, you can see that this is the baseline
of this chart.
It has an everything is it is actually consistent the width of the bars for each countries is equal
and I can have a vertical scale and on the vertical scale I have the value which is given and hence
I obeys what I refer to as the area principle where the area occupied by the graph and what is the
area occupied by the graph it is this area, it is this area, it is this area, it is this area and this area it
is proportional to the data that is being presented.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:21)
The next way people mislead with graph is through use of what we call as truncated graph. Now
what is a truncated graph? Now let me show one thing is where the baseline of a bar chart is not
at 0. What do we mean by baseline of a bar chart is not at 0? Now let me show you this graph
now again this is a regional wise distribution. I have four regions South, West, North and East.
Now when I portrayed this data and this graph to you, you can immediately see there are 500
people and I have just the data is which region do the 500 people come from, that is the data.
Now when I portray or I show this graph the immediate thing or the immediate response or a
person who looks at this data without looking at the access is to imagine that these people from
South and North are much higher than the people from West or East.
That is what this message this graph conveys, but when we look more carefully at the data you
see that this is the baseline and it starts at 0 whereas here it starts at 75. Now these two graphs are
actually the same data. What do I mean by same data? 500 students each one of them tell which
state, region they come from whether it is a South, whether it is a West, whether it is a North or
the East.
When you look at this graph, you feel that the South and North are the ones from where majority
of the student come. Even though majority come it seems that the North and East are negligible
to the distribution from North and South, whereas this graph conveys a different story. So, the
left graph or this graph exaggerate the number whereas this graph shows the same baseline at 0.
Now, this is what is recommended because this is where data integrity is maintained and the
actual story is said. Now where does this matter, now when you are showing a growth and
everything and you truncate the graph or you miss the present data or you mislead, people will
actually attribute a wrong story to this even though both of them represents the same data.
Visually you see that this tells a different story than what do the one on the right says.
So, the second thing is whenever you truncate graph there is a loss in information and it is a
violation this has to be avoided.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:42)
Now some textbooks and some people say that whenever you have a truncated graph or
something you introduce a y axis break. So, if you are starting and you are breaking the axis you
can introduce it either by doing this where I am telling that I am introducing a break in my y axis
or you can show that this is I am not starting from 0 there is a break and I am starting from a
higher value.
For example, if I wanted to start from 75 I should have indicated that I am starting from 75
instead of shifting the graph to 75. So, this is incorrect whereas this is this is the right way to go
about it. So, whenever you are altering or manipulating with the y axis, indicate to the reader that
you have manipulated or you have introduced a y axis break.
