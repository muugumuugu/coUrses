Random variables - cumulative distribution function
(Refer Slide Time: 0:15)
So, the next concept we are going to learn about is, what we understand by a cumulative
distribution function. A probability mass function gave us a
taking a particular value xi.
So, we assume that X takes values x1, x2, xn if they take finite number of values, it takes the
values x1, x2, so forth if it takes countably infinite number of values and the probability mass
function or distribution just told us what is the probability with which X takes a particular value
xi. That is what a distribution function tells us. In other words, it tells us that what is the chance
of this random variable taking a particular value.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:20)
But sometimes we might be interested in knowing for example, we go back to this tossing the
coin thrice and look at the solution here. So, you can see that I am counting the number of heads,
so I either have, so recall my sample space here was a head, head, head; head, head, tail; head,
tail, head; head, tail, tail; tail, head, head; tail, head, tail; tail, tail, head and a tail, tail, tail.
Suppose I am interested in knowing what is the chance, so this probability gave me what is the
chance of me having 1 head?
I can see that, that corresponds to this outcome, this outcome and this outcome and which is .
This is how we got a probability mass function. But now suppose I am interested in asking, what
is the chance that I have got at least 1 head? So, the way I am translating this is what is the
chance that
? The chance of me getting at least 1 head is equal to this or I could also
ask, what is the chance of me getting at most 1 head in 3 tosses? So, in other way, I am asking
So, instead of looking at what is the chance of X taking a particular value, we might be interested
in knowing what is the chance of X is less than or equal to a particular value or greater than or
equal to a particular value?
(Refer Slide Time: 3:11)
To answer this question we introduce what is known as a cumulative distribution function. As
the name suggests a cumulative distribution is that function which accumulates the probabilities
at different points. So, this is a function, so the minute we refer to a function, I need to
understand the function is defined on what, this cumulative distribution function which is given
by capital F, typically it is referred to as capital F is defined for every real value and it takes
values in the closed intervals 0, 1 and how do we define it? For every real value,
(Refer Slide Time: 4:16)
I repeat, a cumulative distribution function F can be expressed as
this
. So, given
is defined for every value of a on my real line. So, let us look at an example. For
example, if X is taking values, whose possible values are X1, X2, X3, let us start with a very
simple example.
X takes finite value 0 and 1 with probability 1 by 4 and 3 by 4. I know that the way my pmf is
defined is
is ,
add up to 1. And in addition,
else.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:44)
is , it is a probability mass function because both of them
for all other i. So, this is equal to 0 for everything
So, what is my chance so if I am going to map every point on my real line to this, then the way I
can start is I look at my real line, I have a 0 here so till the point I have touch the 0, my
probability is going to be 0 because I have defined
is equal to 0 for all points other than 0.
At the point 0, I have a probability of which is 0.25. At 0.1 so if I am looking at
know that this can be
, is 0, but probability X is less than or equal to 0
plus probability X is equal to 0.1, I can see that this I already know is , this is 0, so this would
also be .
At 0.2, it will again be . At 0.5, it will again be 1 . At 0.6 it will again be . So, it continues to
be 0.4 till the time it hits 1. At X equal to 1, it takes a probability . So, what happens?
is the same as
, , so it jumps and it takes so this, if this value is 0.25, this
value is going to be 1, it is jumping at this value and you can see that it continues to take the
value 1 after that. So, this is what is called a cumulative distribution function.
So, what is a distribution function? In the case of a discrete random variable which takes values
X1 which is less than X2 which is strictly less than X3. This is a step function. So, now let us look
at another example.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:15)
For example, I have X which takes values 1, 2, 3, 4, this is my x1 which is strictly less than x2,
which is strictly less than x3, which is strictly less than x4. This is the value. First step, let us
check if it is a probability mass function, yes. 1 by 4, 3 by 4, 3 by 4 is nothing but 4 by, 3 by 4 is
nothing but 6 by 8, 6 plus 1 7, 7 plus 1 8, 8 by 8 so it is a probability mass function, all of them
are non-negative. So, it is a probability mass function.
So, now again recall, I define
to define
to be
. Now, let us start with the following. I need
for all values of a. So, for what is it, so let me start with
). So, if I go back,
I have 1 here, I have 2 here, I have 3 here, I have 4 here. For all a is less than 1, I know
probability of x taking any of the values here is equal to 0, because x takes only discrete values
1, 2, 3, 4. So, it is going to be 0. So, I know that let me use a different colour here.
So, I know that till it, so I know that the probabilities or
going to be 0 till it hits 1. So, this would be 0. So,
1. Now let me have this portion here which is
here, so I know
which is given by the red line is
is going to be 0 as long as a is less than
. So, I am going to write down my
is 0 as long as a is less than 1. Now let us look at the interval, once it hits
a, it takes the value 0.25, so let me have a 0.25 here, this is a 0.5, this is a 0.75 and this is 1.
There is a 0.25 and it continues till X goes to 1. So, this is what is my value, so it takes the value
1 by 4 for a is between 1 and 2.
So, again, I will plot it using my red line. So, I know that what is it? Between 1 and 2, it is going
to be, now there is a discontinuity here and that I am just going to show by dotted lines. Now
when I hit 2, the probability of X less than or equal to, so it is again it goes from 1 by 4 Plus 1 by
2 which is nothing but 1 by 4 plus 1 by 2 is this is 2 by 4, so I have a 3 by 4 which is 0.75. So, I
have a
, it goes here, it continues with the same probability till it hits 3.
So, I have a probability which I write as 3 by 4, for 2 is less than or equal to a is less than 3.
Once it hits 3, so this 6, this is nothing but 6 by 8. So, it becomes 7 by 8 so again what happens
to my graph from 3 to 4, it is 7 by 8 which is very close to this. Again there is a discontinuity
here, after X equal to 4, it continues with 1. There is a discontinuity here.
So, this is how the cumulative, so what do I have here for a so I will have 7 by 8 for 3 is less than
or equal to a is less than 4 and 1 for 4 is less than or equal to a and this is what I have plotted
here, I know that the plot of this function is what we, it resembles a step, hence it is called a step
function We can see that there are discontinuities which I have shown by the dotted line here.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:21)
So, you can see that this is my F of a which was 1 by 4, 3 by 4, 7 by 8 and 1 another thing which
you should notice is the size of the step, what is the size of a step here? The size of the step here
was 0.75 to 0.25 which is 0.5 which is
, the size of the step here is 0.25 which is the
, the size of the step here is 1 by 8, the size of the step here is 1 by 8 which are the
and that is what we have here. The size of the step at any of the values
is equal to the probability that X assumes at that particular value and what are the values that X
assumes? X assumes 1, 2, 3, 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:21)
So, that is how you can see that this is the step function, again for X is less than or equal to 1, it
was 0. This is 0.25, this is 0.75, this is 1, 3 by 6, 7 by 8 and after X equal to 4, it continues. So,
this is defined for all values of my a. So, the cumulative distribution function is defined for all
real values of a and the graph of a cumulative distribution function in the case of a discrete
random variable which takes values X1, X2, Xn such that X1 is less than or equal to X2 is less
than, less than X2 is less than Xn, the distribution, the cumulative distribution is a step function.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:29)
So, in summary what we have seen is, we have seen so far what is a probability mass function.
So, given a random variable which takes countably finite or infinite values associated with each
one of the values I define what is the probability of X taking a particular value.
I can represent it in a tabular form or I can illustrate it by the values of X on the x axis and the
probability of X on the y axis. This is referred to as the graph of the pmf for example, if it take
x1, x2, xn with probabilities p1, p2, and pn, I know that this is the graph of the probability mass
function.
From the graph I can describe the distribution, while describing the distribution I can see whether
the distribution is uniform, whether it is symmetric, whether it is skewed. These are the things
which we can see from the distribution. And then we further define what was the probably
cumulative distribution function, this we define for every value or real value of a which is
nothing but probability X is less than or equal to a and in the case the random variable takes x1,
x2, xn, with x1 strictly less than x2 is strictly less than xn, then we saw that the graph of this
cumulative distribution function is a step function.
Many books refer to the probability mass function as pmf and cumulative distribution function as
cdf. We need these concepts to understand the bigger inferential statistics part but this at a
conceptual level you need to understand what is a probability mass function and what is a
cumulative distribution function.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:59)
The next question we are going to answer is again I said we are interested in answering or we are
interested in knowing questions about typically we would be interested in answering questions
about so, I know now what is a random variable, I know again what is the variable which the
values this variable takes.
So, now the next thing which we are going to understand is suppose I am interested in knowing
from a population I take a random sample of people and the question I ask them is how many
credit cards they own? Again, there is a count of the number, so I can model the response which
is the number of credit cards owned by a person as a random variable in particular I can model it
as a different random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:55)
So, we will next look at an application of how to use the concept of both the probability mass
function and the probability cumulative distribution function to answer questions from a real
application which is about the number of credits cards a person uses. This is what we will be
doing next.
