Random Variables - Application
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
We just looked at a few generic examples of how we can define a random variable, we talked
about mapping the random variable to a particular event. And talking also now, given the
probability of an event we associated probability of the random variable taking a particular
value. So now, let us look at an application wherein we define a random variable and we get the
probability of these random variables through the events they correspond to the application is
application from life insurance.
So, I have a life insurance agent who has two elderly clients. Both of them have a life insurance
policy that pays 1 lakh upon death rupees 1 lakh upon death. So, this is a hypothetical case, I
have two people, and both of them have insured life insurance and they will get a pay-out that is
the people the survivor, the nominees should get a pay-out of 1 lakh upon the death. So, I am
defining two events. Now, what are what is a random experiment here?
So, the random experiment is I want to know, in the next year, in the following year, what are the
possible things that could happen, the possible things that could happen is both of them die in the
following year, both of them die, or one of them die, or none of them die, these are the possible
things that could happen in the following year. Now, when both of them die, I know both die one
of them die. So, if I am calling A and B, A dies, B survives or A survives and B dies, or both A
and B survive, these are the possible outcomes if I am talking of this in terms of a random
experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:30)
So now, let A be the event that the younger one dies. So, between the two of them I assume one
is older, and one is younger, so I am calling A I am letting A to be the event that the younger one
dies in the following year, and B to be the event that the older one dies in the following year. So,
I said what are the outcome, the outcome is both die. So, this corresponds to both event A and B
happening, younger one dies older one survives only A happens B does not happen. Older one
dies only older one only younger one dies, only older one dies so, here A does not happen B
happens both survive both A and B do not happen. I hope this is clear. So, I have just first these
are the possible outcomes.
And these I have listed or mapped each one of the possible outcomes to in terms of the event,
when both die I say both events A and B happens and I know mathematically I can express this
only the younger one dies, but the older one does not die, it is
happens, but and B happens
. Both A and B do not die, So,
. A does not die
. So, in terms of
events, we can translate whatever we are expressing in plain English in the mathematical
abstraction.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:42)
Now, we want to associate so now the next thing is, I assume A and B are independent. This is
absolutely a very valid assumption because when I am talking about two people dying, it need
not be the case that once death affects anybody so the events are independent and I am
associating some subjective probabilities perhaps I am associating a probability A which is very
low with the younger one and probability B which is point one with the older one.
Now, let X denote the total money that the company pays out in this year to its clients
beneficiaries in amount of lakhs. So, what is that the company note will pay out money only if
there is a death, let us assume that the company pays out the money only if there is a death. So, x
is a total amount of money that is paid out to any one of the clients beneficiaries.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:50)
So again, let us go back to our earlier thing I had both dying. So, when both die, the company has
to give money. When both die it gives money to both the beneficiaries, when the younger one
dies it gives and both of them have insured for the same amount, so when both die both of them
have insured for 1 lakh upon death, so I will have to pay 2 lakhs to both the beneficiaries only
the younger one dies, I pay 1 lakh to the younger ones family, older one dies, I pay 1 lakh to the
older one family, when both of them survive, I do not have to pay anything. So, my payment is 0
lakhs.
So, if you look at the value this X is taking, it is taking the value 0, it is taking the value 1, and it
is taking the value 2. I repeat the value X is taking X is taking the value 0, X is taking the value
1, and X is taking the value 2. And you can see that X taking the value 2 is corresponding to the
event that both of them die which again corresponds to both A and B happening which is written
Similarly, the value of 0 corresponds to both surviving which is same as both A and B do not
happen, which is
. But you can see that the probability of X taking the value 1 can
happen if only the younger one dies, or only the older one dies only the younger one dies
corresponds to
, only the older one dies corresponds to
So, if one of these two events happen, I know X takes the value 1 we have already seen earlier, A
or B happens is represented by
, or
here I am not talking about A or B, I am talking about
for the value of X to be equal to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:23)
So we can summarise the discussion by saying that X takes the values what are the values X
takes? X takes the value 0, the relevant event is A compliment intersection B complement that is
what we just established a couple of minutes before that this A X takes the value 0 is with A
compliment intersection B complement takes the value 1 with
And X takes the value 2 with
relevant event is
values X can take is
it is equivalent to A intersection B so X takes the value 0
1 it is
, it takes the value 2 these are the only 3
. Again as in the previous case, I can associate probabilities to I
want to know what is the probability with which X does not give out any money probability with
it X gives out a pay out of 1 lakh probability with which X gives out a pay out of 2 lakhs. See
these are the numerical values associated with the outcomes of the experiment.
So, you can see that probability X equal to 0 is same as
independent,
is also independent of
multiplication rule. So, I have this is
0.1, which gives us
is 0.95 and
. And we also know
, which I know if A and B are
, this is a
. What is given to us is
is 0.9. Hence, I have
is 0.05.
is 0.95 into a 0.9.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:08)
So, I have probability X takes the value 0 is 0.95 into 0.9, which is given by 0.855. Similarly,
, is again
., we can check that these two are disjoint sets. And
we know for any two disjoint sets
This is my addition rule for disjoint sets, I can use that I know probability X equal to 1 is
, which is
. Again, if A and B are independent,
A is independent of
. So, this would be
Again, we know
is 0.05
is 0.1. So, I have this as
here 0.9
here into 0.1 0.05 into 0.9 plus 0.95 into 0.1 that is my probability X equal to 1 which is
which is 0.140.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:59)
Finally, I want to know what is probability X equal to 2, this is
independent. So, this is
, we know
is 0.05
again A and B are
is 0.1. So, I can get the
probability of A X equal to 2 is 0.005. So, what we have seen is, I have from given the events A
and B and the respective probabilities I am associating the relevant events to the values X can
take to get what is the
, and
, . So, this is a simple application of
how we define a random variable and associate probabilities to that random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:02)
So, what is next, so if you look at what we are going to do in the first portion of the next few
weeks is we are going to look at discrete random variables. So, what is a discrete random
variable, a discrete random variable can be formally defined as a random variable that can take
on at most a countable number of possible values. In other words, we will look at examples
where a random variable can take on a finite number of values.
For example, X takes the value 0, 1, 2, 3 finite number of values or X could take a value x 1, 2,
3, 4. So, for countably infinite but it has to be countable. You have already learned about what is
countable sets or what is properties of countability in your mathematics courses, but what I want
you to understand is a random variable which can take on a finite number or a countably infinite
number is referred to as a discrete random variable.
Now, there could be random variables whose set of values are uncountable. Now, I am not going
to formally define a continuous random variable, but then, when the outcomes of a random
variable are numerical, but cannot be counted on and infinitely divisible, we have continuous
random variables. The formal definition of a continuous random variable is slightly more
involved. I will come to it when we specifically look at the continuous random variable case. But
for now, we are going to focus on discrete random variables.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:01)
So, in summary, what we are learned in this module is, we introduce the extremely important
concept of what is a random variable, namely a numerical quantity associated with outcomes of a
sample space. And then through actually mapping it to relevant events from the sample space,
we computed what was the probability of a random variable, this is what we did. Then, we define
what are discrete and continuous random variables, we did not give a very rigorous definition of
a continuous random variable. But whenever a random variable takes countable number of
values, we typically refer to them as discrete otherwise, and we refer to them as continuous
random variables.
So, moving forward, we would focus on a discrete random variable. And how do we describe
these discrete random variables, in terms of its distribution is what is going to be of interest next.
