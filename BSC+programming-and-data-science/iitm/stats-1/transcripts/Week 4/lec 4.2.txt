Association between Two Categorical Variables - Introduction
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
Now what is the next thing?
(Refer Slide Time: 0:17)
So far we have focused on understanding only about summarizing a single variable. But most of
the time we are interested in understanding whether two variables are associated with each other.
When I talk about association I am not mentioning about causality. Association is not always
causality. We are not talking about causality here, but you are just asking questions about
association between variables.
So, in this module the learning objectives are first we start by understanding association between
two categorical variables. Here, we will introduce the notion of contingency tables and how we
use contingency tables to understand the association between two categorical variables. Then we
move forward to understand how two numerical variables are associated with each other. Here we
talk about scatter plots. The nature of this plot and how we measure the association between two
numerical variables.
Though the focus of this module is mainly to understand association between two categorical and
association between numerical variables, we also spend some time to understand how you will talk
about a relationship or an association between a categorical and a numerical variable. So, these are
the learning objectives of this week.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:01)
So, we start with the association between categorical variables. So, what is the main objective of
this section? So, here we are going to understand about how to construct what we refer to as a two
way contingency table. We will introduce the concept of relative frequencies and use how you can
use this concept of relative frequency to determine whether there is an association between two
categorical variables or not.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:37)
So, let us start with an example. Now if you look at this example I have a market research firm
which is interested in finding out whether ownership of a smart phone is associated with gender
of a student. In other words, the company is interested in knowing whether more females own a
smart phone while compared to males or whether owning a smart phone is independent of the
gender of a person. This is the main question.
So, how do we go about answering this question? Immediately you see that when I talk about this
I have actually discussed two variables. The first variable is gender and the second variable is
ownership of a smart phone. So, how have we captured this gender is again a categorical variable.
It has two categories. I am assuming male and female. Ownership the way I have captured the
ownership of a smart phone is again through a categorical variable. Here, it is a binary if you own
a phone you say yes, if you do not own a phone you say no.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:03)
So, let us look at the data. So, if you look at the data you can see that this is a data. What is a data?
I have the data which has been collected where the variables which I am talking about are basically
you can see gender and whether they own a smart phone or not, that is the data that is collected
and this data is actually collected for 100 university students. So, what is the data?
The data that is collected is a group of 100 college going children were surveyed about whether
they own a smart phone or not. So, the data collected is for each student what was captured, gender
and whether they own a phone or not. So yes, no, and gender was captured. So, for example, person
1, I ask a gender it could be a male. This person if they owned a cellphone it would have been yes.
Person 2, male does not own a phone.
Person 3 could have been a female does not own a phone. Person 4 could have been a female owns
a phone, person n, and this is the way for 100 students we collect this data. So, the two variables
here are gender. The second variable here is whether they have a smart phone or not. Yes, if they
have a phone no, if they do not have a phone. So, this is the data we have collected. The total
number of observations are 100 and this is how we have collected the data.
So, what are the categorical variables in this example? The first categorical variable is gender.
They are two categories and we know that gender is a nominal variable. Then next categorical
variable is whether you own a smart phone or no. The values this variable take are yes and no. The
values gender take are male and female. Again I have two categories, again it is a nominal variable
because there is no order in this variable.
Hence, you can see that I need to know that what is the kind of my variable and what is the scale
of measurement. Here I have both the categorical variables with nominal scales of measurement.
(Refer Slide Time: 6:53)
So, now let us look at the data once you have the data, this is the data which I am talking about.
So, here you have 100 students and from each of these observations I copy their gender and
whether they own a smart phone or not. So, what is the summary statistics I have from my data?
The summary statistics I have from my data are I have 44 female students and 56 male students.
Remember we are asking 100 students the question a for every student we record what is their
gender and we record whether they own a smart phone or not. This is our survey.
Further, 76 students owned a smart phone and 24 did not own. So, if you look at it what we
discussed in the previous weeks was, first if I look at gender as a categorical variable how to
summarize this gender. I know 44 female and 56 male we saw that we could summarize it using a
bar chart. Again owning a smart phone or not. Ownership yes no, I have 76 yes and 24 no. Again
there are two values this ownership takes, yes and no and both of them here 44 + 56 add up to a
100. 76 + 24 add up to a 100.
Now I want to know the association between these two variables. So, I have another data which is
useful to me which says that 34 female students owned a smart phone and 42 owned a smart phone.
So, this is the data which is given to us. So, the first question we ask is how do I summarize this
data. So, given this data which is in the form of this table which I have here, the question is how
do I summarize this data? I have two variables, the first variable I can write it as a gender.
Now there are two values this gender takes I write it as a female, I write it as a male. So this is my
variable. The other variable is ownership. Now this is a yes or this is a no this is a yes and I have
grand totals. So, if I have the grand row total, I have it here, I have a column total here. So, you
can see that there were 44 female that is what is given here, 56 male that is what is given here.
Now when I come to ownership 24 did not own, so my no is 24, 76 owned. So, we can see that
this total add up to 100 student. This is the first thing. I am not looking at filling in the inside table,
but these are the 44 females, 56 males in my dataset, 24 not owning, 76 owning. Now further the
so this is what I have tabulated. So, this is 34 because 34 female owned a smart phone. Similarly,
42 male owned a smart phone.
Now how many did not own that is easy. 10 which is 44 - 34 and here I have 14 which is 56 - 42.
We can see 10 + 14 = 24, 34 + 42 = 76 and we can also check that 10 + 34 = 44 and 14 + 42 = 56.
So, summarizing this data or the data given here is referred to as a two way table more popularly
referred to as a contingency table. How do we construct a contingency table?
To construct a contingency table we look at the first variable. The levels of the first variable in this
the first variable is gender and it has two values female and male. So, suppose this variable takes
3 values. So the level 1, level 2, level 3 or level m of the first variable goes into my rows. I look at
my second variable. Suppose there are n values of the second variable. I have level 1, level 2, level
n, I will have n columns.
And what goes into the i, jth column here is the number of observations of the ith variable and the
jth variable together. For example 34 is a number of female students who own a phone. So, this is
how we construct what is a contingency table.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:30)
And you can see that this is how we have summarize the contingency table. Now in this example
,both gender and ownership of smart phone both of them where what we referred to as a nominal
variable. There was no order in this variable. So, if I had constructed my contingency table by
looking at the following, that is male, female, no, yes it would not have made a difference because
the information given is the same.
The order did not matter whether I had female and male or yes or no it would not have made a
difference. So, the order in which you are stating your variables in the contingency table will not
matter when both my variables are nominal in nature.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:39)
Now we will discuss how to create these contingency table using Google sheet. Go to the data, so
this is the data which I have here. You can see that this data has 100 observations on both the
variables. The variable gender is in my B column, the variable smart phone is in my C column.
So, how do I create the contingency table? I choose my or I highlight my data, how many
observations do we have?
We have 100 observations, I highlight my data so I would go and choose the columns. the variables
I seek association now are gender and ownership. I choose it then I go to the data tab and click on
what is called pivot table. That is step 2, go to data and click on the pivot table option. Now in the
pivot table, create pivot table. It opens the pivot table editor in the existing sheet.
I am going to so I go to data I click on pivot table in the existing sheet. I am just going to give a
location to my pivot table. The location I give it here and now I go to Create. Under the rows tab
add the first categorical variable which is gender. Under the columns tab, click on the second
categorical variable which is ownership of a smart phone that is 3.2 step. Under the values tab so
I go back here, under the values tab I click on either of the variables.
So, I clicked on gender here and I am asking it to summarize by count A and you can see that I
have what I got here is my precisely this is the categorical or the contingency table which we just
did a few minutes before. So, you can see that there are 34 females who own a phone, 42 males
who own a phone, 10 females do not own a phone, 14 males do not own a phone, 42 females and
56 males in my dataset and 24 do not own a phone whereas 76 own a phone.
This is what I get from my dataset. So, this is the pivot table in your Google sheet which gives you
a contingency table in Google sheet. So, if you saw in the earlier example we had two nominal
variables. Now what would happen if I have a ordinal variable?
(Refer Slide Time: 17:02)
Now, let us look at another example here. Now in the earlier thing I saw whether gender was
associated with ownership of a phone, I summarize that using a contingency table. Now I am going
to look at whether income actually is associated with ownership of a phone. So, again we have the
same market research phone which is interested in finding out about whether ownership of a phone
again this ownership of a smart phone is my variable here is associated with income of an
individual.
Now the income variable is again how do we record this income variable. In this example, we have
a market research firm which is interested in finding out whether ownership ownership of a smart
phone is associated with income. So, what are the two variables here? The first variable is
ownership. Again this was the variable we considered in our earlier example, but now instead of
gender I am considering income. Now how is this income recorded?
How is this income recorded, the income is recorded as high, medium or low. So, we have
categorized this income into 3 categories and what are the values of this income variable. It is a
high, medium and low. So, this is a categorical variable where I am not actually calculating or I
have not recorded the actual income, but I have actually categorized these 100 people again into
whether they come from a high income group or a medium income group or a low income group.
And for each of these person we are asking whether their income is a high income and whether
they own a smart phone or not. This is how I have recorded my data. So, here if you look at this
case now what are my variable? Again the categorical variable are income which is low, medium
and high and the second categorical variable whether you own a smart phone or not.
This variable whether you own it or not has two categories, the yes category and the no category.
It is a nominal variable whereas the income which has three categories, the low, medium and high
is an ordinal variable because there is an order in low, medium, and high because low income is
lesser than medium income which is lesser than high income. So, recall when you are summarizing
two nominal variables.
We said the order in which they appear in the table is not of any relevance. However, when you
have an ordinal variable it is good to maintain the order. What do we mean by this?
(Refer Slide Time: 20:25)
Suppose I again continue with the same way. I choose income and own a smart phone. I choose
these 100 observations, I go to my data, I click on pivot table in my existing sheet I am going to
create my pivot table here. Again under rows I add income, under columns I add own a smart
phone and under values I am just going to add on a income, you can see that this is my contingency
table which I have here, but what you notice in this contingency table is first I have a high which
is highlighted here.
So, let us go and look at only the contingency table. So, you can see in the contingency table, if
you are looking at the order of the income, you have a high income, a low income and a medium
income. Whereas the actual order is either high, medium, low or low medium, high. That is the
order in which the variable appears. So, you do not want to see a jumbled order of a variable where
there is an order of the variable. One way to overcome this is to have a order, have a high, medium
and low variable. I have just coded this variable as 1, 2, 3 where 1 represents a high income, 2
represents a medium income, 3 represents a low income.
So, now if I am looking at a contingency table between these two variables again I choose the 100
observations which I need. I choose the 100 observations. I again go to data, pivot table in the
existing sheet I am going to go and create a data a pivot table here. I will just click on this. I am
going to create it. Rows I again add the income, columns I add whether they add have a smart
phone, values I am going to do the count again.
So, now you can see and you can actually compare these two tables, the first table my high, low
and medium did not have an order whereas in the second table, 1 represents a high income group,
2 represents a medium income group, and 3 represents a low income group. So, you can see that
the order is preserved in the contingency table. So, whenever you have an ordinal variable it is
recommended that the order is preserved in your contingency table.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:58)
So, what finally how does my contingency table look for this. I have this data and using this data
you can see that the corresponding table, corresponding to this data is I have a high, medium, low
the order is preserved in the income whether they own a smart phone or not is recorded. I have 20
people who are high income, 66 who are medium, 14 who are low income. Out of these 162 own
a phone, 38 do not own a phone.
Among the high income 20 people, 18 own a phone, 2 do not own a phone. Among the 14, low
income group 9 do not have a phone, 5 have a phone. Among the 66, I have 27 who do not own a
phone and 39 who own a phone.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:03)
So, at the end of this subsection you should know how to organize bivariate categorical data into
a two way table. Record the first variable and its level in one. These could be the rows. Record the
second variable here, this is variable 1, variable 2, and a cell here, the ith level and the jth level tell
how many of variable I and variable jth level of variable 2, variable 1 ith level and variable 2 jth
level are there in this particular cell and this is what is referred to as a contingency table. A word
of caution, if the data is ordinal maintain the order of the variable in the table.
