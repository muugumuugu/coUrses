Association between two numerical variables- Fitting a Line
(Refer Slide Time: 0:16)
So, we have seen that this correlation and covariance are measures of linear relationship or linear
association between two numerical variables; it measures a strength of a association.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:34)
So, when I say that the association is a linear association. The next natural question to ask is, can
I summarize this linear association through a mathematical equation in particular? The question
we are asking as can this linear relationship be summarized through a equation of a line.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:03)
So, the question we are asking here is, when I am saying that 
 and 
 are numerical variables and
they have association which I expect to be linear.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:15)
Then the next question we are asking is can I described that association using the equation of a
line? If yes, then how do I compute this equation of a line? The mathematics behind coming up
with an equation of a line is beyond the scope of this particular course. You will be learning about
how to come out with what we call the best line of fit in your future courses. But, what I want you
to see at this point of time is, yes; the relationship can be summarized. How do I summarize this?
(Refer Slide Time: 2:06)
So, let us go back to our Goggle sheets; so you can see that I start with my first data here, which
is my size wise is the price. I go to this data set. So, how do I find the equation of a line using a
Google sheet?
(Refer Slide Time: 2:28)
So, the first step is you open the scatter plot. So, I first go and I insert a scatter plot and this scatter
plot is what I have here; so first I go and I insert this scatter plot. So, the next step is under the
Customize tab, so I have a scatter plot here. This is scatter plot of size versus price; size is my
explanatory variable, price is my response variable. Under the Customize tab click on Series, so
under the Customize tab I click on series here; now within this click on trendline.
I clicked on series, I clicked on trendline; so, you can see a blue line which passes through my
points. Now, the next thing is this trendline, so the question we ask is can I capture this linear
relationship using the equation of a line? I can see that I can fit a line through the points passing
through the points. Now, further if I want to know what is the equation under the Label tab; so
within this I have a Label tab. Under this Label tab click on this Use Equation; so it gives me the
equation. You can see here the equation states price to equal 30.5 
 here is my size +36.
This is of the type 
, which all of us know is the equation of a straight line. Now, further
I can also ask it to report this 
 2 ; so it gives an 
 2 of 0.647. What is this 
 2 capture? This
 2 actually captures the proportion of variance in my data set; that is captured by this line. Again
to go into the mathematics of this 
 2 and how to derive it is beyond this scope of this course; but,
 2 basically is also a measure of how good a fit is this line.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:01)
This 
 2 takes the value, so this 
 2 is also referred to a goodness of fit measure. It is an 
 2 , so this
takes values between 0 and 1. The closer it is equal to 1, says that my fit is a good fit; the closer it
is to 0, tells my fit is not a good fit for my data. So, now let us look at what is this 
 2 for different
examples which we have looked. In the first example this is what I have demonstrated just now, I
have price which is my 
; the response variable is 30.5 
 + my 36. So, the slope of this line is
30.5, you can see that the slope is positive; and your 
 2 is 0.647.
Recall my correlation coefficient was 0.804. An interesting observation is if I square this
correlation coefficient; so you can see that I computed the correlation coefficient of my first data
set to be 0.804. If I just square this term, I get 0.647 which is precisely this value of my 
 2 .
(Refer Slide Time: 6:45)
So, let us go back to our data here, so you can see that when I have a correlation which is closer to
1; my 
 2 which is the square of this would also be closer to 1. This is about 
, the first thing is my
 2 will only lie between 0 and 1; so, in a sense you can imagine to flip this along this 0. So, if I
have a value which is here 
 value here; my 
 2 is going to be closer to 1. So, as my 
 goes to 0,
 2 will also tend to 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:35)
Let us look at an example to illustrate what we have just discussed. So, if I go and look at the same
thing for this data set, we know about the age of a car and the price of a car. This is the next data
set. Again I go and I click on a scatter plot, again I go to my Customize option; under series I
plotted a trendline. And again I ask for a equation with a 
 2 .
(Refer Slide Time: 8:14)
So, here what you noticed? You notice that the price is 
0.694 
 + 3. With again an 
 2 of 0.855;
which is price equal to 
0.694. So, my slope of the line is negative, which is 0.694; the intercept
is 9.03. And then we also see that the
 2 is 0.855; even though your 
 was 
 0.92. So, my 
this case or my correlation in this case was actually here; the correlation was closer to 
1. It was
very strong negative linear relationship; my 
 2 is closer 1.
So, you can see that this goodness of fit measure takes a values between 0; and 1 but it does not
tell me the direction of the relationship. For the direction, whether it is a positive relationship or
negative relationship. I either look at the correlation coefficient or the sine of the slope; in this case
the slope is a negative number.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:40)
Now, let us look at the third example. The third example my 
 was very negligible; so it says that
almost no relation. It is giving me the equation of a line; but what you have noticed about this line,
it is almost parallel to my 
 axis. But, and your 
 2 is closer to 0. So, when your 
 2 is closer to 0;
the goodness of the fit measure is also very low. So, when your 
 2 is close to 0; it quantifies the
strength of the relationship. And you can say that my line is not actually describing this association
very well.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:26)
So, in summary what we have looked that is how do we obtain the equation of a line; we are not
again gone into the mathematics of trying to find, what is a line of best fit. However, we got this
equation of a line through our Google sheets. And when we looked at the equation of a line; so I
get it as 
 is my response variable, 
 is my explanatory variable.
And 
 is the slope of the line, 
 is the intercept. The sine of the slope, so if 
 > 0; then this says
that I have a positive relationship. 
 < 0, it says that I have a negative relationship; and we also
define what is 
 2 , which is a goodness of fit measure. 
 2 lies between 0 and 1 and it if it is closer
to 1; we are getting equations of the line. It says that the fit, I am talking about when it comes to a
fit; I mean that the line is not capturing the variability in the data as much as in the other case. So,
the proportion of variability in my data set that is captured by this line is very low, if 
 2 is closer
to 0. And it is pretty high, if the 
 2 = 1.
So, with this we actually have seen the following. In this section we started by looking at the
association between two numerical variables; earlier we looked at association between categorical
variables. Now, in this case the key thing is, we first learned about how we set up what we called
is contingency table. Here we started with a scatter plot to look at the association, and then we
introduced the notion of relative frequency here.
We looked at row relative frequency and column related frequency. If they are the same for all
rows and columns, then after we set. When we looked at association between numerical variables,
we started by looking at a scatter plot. From here we wanted to just have a visual inspection, within
the visual inspection we identified what was the direction.
Whether it is a positive trend or a negative trend, whether it is a curve or a line, whether there they
are tight, whether they clustered, or the presence of outliers; these are the four things which we
looked at. We finally then we said that okay I am focus on a linear association between variables.
Now, if I want to know the strength of this association; I introduced two main numerical measures,
which are covariance and correlation measures. And finally we also looked at how to summarize
or describe this linear relation through a equation of a line. We introduced the concept of 
 2 which
is nothing but the goodness of the fit measure.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:16)
So, now if you look at variables, again you go back to your where we started from. And we saw
that when we look at variables; I can broadly classify my variables or my data as categorical data
and I can numerical data. So, this portion looked at association when both my variables or pair of
variables are categorical. This looked at what happens when pair of variables are numerical in
nature.
