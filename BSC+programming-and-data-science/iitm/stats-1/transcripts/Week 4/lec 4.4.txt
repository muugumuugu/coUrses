Association between Two Numerical Variables: Scatterplot
(Refer Slide Time: 00:16)
The next part of this lecture, we are going to understand how we describe the association
between 2 numerical variables. What are we going to do in this case; we first introduced what is
a scatter plot. And then we try and interpret the association between the 2 variables using the
scatter plot. Recall, we interpreted the association between 2 categorical variables using the
notion of a contingency table.
And here we are going to use a notion of a scatter plot. And then further, we will just briefly
introduce how we summarize this association through a concept of a line. And then we will also
introduce the notion of a correlation matrix so that this notion can be extended to understand
association between more than 2 variables.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:14)
So what is a scatter plot? A scatter plot is defined as a graph that displays pairs of values as
points on a 2-dimensional plane. So, what do we mean by this?
(Refer Slide Time: 01:33)
So, let us start with a very simple example. Suppose I am looking at 2 variables, what are the 2
variables I am looking at? The first variable I am looking at is age. And the second variable I am
looking at is height. The people are the same. So I have an observation here. So, this is my first
or this is the person, okay, the first person is of age 1 and 75 centimeters; person 2, person 3,
person 4, person 5 and I am just looking at the age of this person.
So what this means, and the way I can interpret is, the person's 1 age is 1 and 75 centimeters, I
can write this as an order pair 1, 75. For the person 2 age is 2 and height is 85 centimeters, age is
measured in years, height is measured in centimeters, person 3 is 3 and 94 centimeters, person 4
is 4 and 101 and person 5 is 5 and 108 centimeters, okay. So, I have 2 variables, both of the
variables are numerical.
And I am measuring these 2 variables age in units of years and height in units of centimeters.
And the question we are asking here is are age and height associated with each other? This is the
question we are asking. This is the question we are asking. Now to answer this question, we first
try and plot it as a scatter plot on a 2-dimensional plane. Now when I am plotting it on a 2
dimensional plane, all of us know that this axis is called the x axis and this axis is called the y
axis.
So the first thing which we need to decide is which of these 2 variables would go on the x axis
and which variable would go on the y axis. The rule of thumb is when I want to understand the
association between any 2 variables typically I might want to know whether one variable is being
explained by the other variable.
In this example, I would want to know whether as a person grows older, I want to know what is
the height or what is the association with the height does the height of an individual increase or
does it decrease or is there any association at all? So the variable that goes on to your x axis that
is also referred to as the explanatory variable.
The variable that you are using to explain and the variable you would like to explain, which is
height in this example, is also referred to as a response variable that is one my Y axis. So, I can
write my response variable on my Y axis. In this case, it is the height which is measured in
centimeters. And my explanatory variable is age which is again measured in years. So, once I
have the age and height written then I will go and start writing on my x axis.
Remember, we are again talking about numerical data, there is an order to it, so, I have a start
with the 0 yet I have a 1, I have a 2, I have a 3, I have a 4, I have a 5, I have a 6. I can start
putting my data on my x axis and what is the data on my x axis? It is the age in years that is
what is given to me. Now, when I look at the height, I can start and remember I can put a break
here because I wants to start with 70 centimeters, I have 80, 90, 100, 110.
So, first age 75. So, this would be the point which is associated with my first point with 2 I have
85 which is this point, with 3 I have 94 which is this point, with 4 I have 101, which is again this
point and with 5 I have 108, which is this point. So, in effect what we have done is, we have
actually plotted the data that is a pair of values.
What are the pairs of values we have here? This is the first pair this is the second pair, this is the
third pair, this is a fourth pair and this is the fifth pair, I have these 5 pairs of values, which I
have represented as points on my 2-dimensional plane. So, this plot which I have constructed
here is what we refer to as a scatter plot.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:20)
So, the scatter plot is an extremely powerful graph, which generally is just the scatter or it is a
display of pairs of values of my variables. Now, let us look at another example. So, a real estate
agent has collected the prices of different size of homes. So, what the real estate agent has done?
He has gone he has collected 1, 2, 3 up to 15 homes. So, the real estate agent has collected on
every home the size of the house, this is measured in thousands of square feet and the price of the
house in lakhs of rupees. This is what I have as my data.
So what is it I am seeking? The seeking the question I am seeking an answer to is whether there
is a relationship between the price of a home and size of home. Now in this example, you very
clearly see that I want to see whether the prices vary according to the sizes. So, the natural
explanatory variable in this case in this example is going to be the size of a house, whereas my
response variable in this case is going to be the price of a house.
So, whenever you want to understand the association between 2 variables and you are interested
in plotting or coming up with a graphical display in terms of a scatter plot. The first step is to
recognize what is your explanatory variable and what is your response variable. So, next he
wanted to know whether the prices of homes increase linearly with this size. We will come to
answer this question in some time, but even before that, we want to see what is the data is
recorded.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:29)
So, this is my data. So, I have a different data given here. So with this data, what we do is if I am
just going to so I have 15 data points and I have these are the lakhs INR, lakhs or 68 lakhs is 800
square feet house is costing me 68 lakhs, 1000 square feet is 81 lakhs, 1100 square feet is 72
lakhs and 3400 square feet house is 170 lakhs. So what I do now I just so now I have, I need to
plot a scatter plot. So on my x axis I am going to take the size. On the y axis, I take the price of
the house plot a scatter plot, how do I plot a scatter plot.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:16)
So let us go back to our Google Sheets. This is the data given I have the same data given in my
Google Sheet. So you can see that this is the same data I have 0.8, 0.1. 1.1 so I have 68, 81, 72
this is in square feet, and this is in lakhs of rupees. So the first thing I want to ask is can a plot a
scatter plot, the Google Sheet gives me an easy way to plot a scatter plot. Let us go about and
plot a scatter plot using a Google Sheet.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:51)
So the first step is highlight the data you want to plot as a scatter plot. And I have highlighted
that data insert chart. So if I go to insert and go for a chart, you can see that I have a scatter chart,
which has appeared. And this is what it is under the x axis tab, the x axis (I have) it chooses the
square feet, and it has automatically chosen in this case, because that was my first column
available.
And in under the series tab, it gives me what is the response variable, which is again price in INR
lakhs, and I can again, label, title and access appropriately. So you can see that I have a nice
scatter plot between the size and the price which I got from my Google Sheet. So this is the
scatter plot we have got, again, I have size on my x axis, and price on my Y axis. So this tells us
how to construct a scatter plot.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:05)
Now once given a scatter plot, let us look at another example. For example, if I go and look at
this other example I have here, so the same price so I remove this, let me remove this graph,
because I have already I delete this chart. Let me go to another example where I am again,
talking about same the price and the size versus the price. This is the data I have, but if I am
plotting a scatter plot between this data, you can notice a scatter plot of this kind, okay.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:47)
So, let us copy the scatter plot. So, what we do is this is the scatter plot again 15 homes I have a
scatter plot here. So this graph both the graphs actually plot size versus price. This is for my first
data set which I call data set 1 and this is for the second data set which I refer to as data set 2,
okay. So now, if you look at this in data set 1, I can observe that as the sizes of the homes are
increasing, the prices are also exhibiting some sort of a trend or it increases.
Whereas in this I have smaller homes for example, if I look at this size of a home, I have bought
a lower priced house and higher priced house and I have larger homes also this is a larger home
because the size is a larger size, this size also I have a lower price and a higher price. A midsize
home also has a lower price and a larger price. In other words, this data set 1 has a pattern which
I can in some sense explain whereas in data set 2 I do not see any clear pattern.
So, the first thing which we want to understand is, remember, we wanted to know whether a
scatter plot can actually help us understand association between numerical variables. So, we can
see that from these 2 examples in the case of 1 example I can actually see a pattern whereas in
the other case, I do not see any clear pattern. So the visual test for association tells us whether
you can see a pattern or not see a pattern.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:54)
So, what we have learned so far as a first given data set identify what is your explanatory
variable and what is your response variable. Given this, let your explanatory variable be on the x
axis, response variable on the y axis, draw a scatter plot.
Once you have a scatter plot then I could have a scatter plot which is of this kind where I see a
pattern or I could have a scatter plot which is of this kind where I really do not see any clear
pattern between my x and y. This is referred to as a visual test for association and how do we
actually draw conclusions from this visual test is what we are going to see next.
