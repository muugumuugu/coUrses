Association between Two Categorical Variables - Relative Frequencies
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, we have seen how to construct a contingency table or in other words how to summarize the
bivariate data where both my variables are categorical in nature as a contingency table. Now we
introduce a very important concept, the concept of a relative frequency. We introduce these
concepts when we looked at single categorical variable. Recall relative frequency was nothing, but
your frequency by total number of observations.
Relative frequency is what we refer to when we talked about categorical variables as frequency
into total number of observations. We have already introduced a notion of a relative frequency,
but what do we have in a contingency table. In a contingency table for example I had female, I had
male. I had 44 females and I had 56 males, I had 76 people who owned a cellphone.
I have 24 people who did not own a cellphone this was what was my data. So, we can go back to
your data here. We are talking about this data here. So, I have 70 in this dataset you can see that I
had 44, 56 then I have 42 men and 34 women owned cellphone. So, 10 women and I have again
14 men did not own a cellphone. So, this is we call this is the contingency table I have.
Now this is my row total what is my row total 44 females and 56 men 24 and my 76 represent or
my column totals you can see that the total of the row totals and the total of the column totals are
equal and they add up to 100.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:58)
So, now suppose if I am interested in asking a question what is the proportion of total participants
who own a phone? Now that is simple total participants are 100 of which 76 people own a phone
and 24 people do not own a phone. So, 76 out of 100 people actually own a phone in other words
this is the proportion of my total participants who own a phone. Similarly, 24 out of 100 people
do not own a phone. So this answer to this question is easily given that the proportion of total
participants who own a phone is 76 percentage.
Now let me modify this question a bit and ask that what is the proportion of female participants
who own a phone. Now how do we answer this question again if you go back here you can see
that there are totally 44 female participants of which 34 participants own a phone. So, the
proportion of female participants who own a phone is 34 divided by 44 of the total number of
female participants how many female participants we have totally 44 of them I am asking what is
the proportion who own a phone 34 by 44.
Similarly, I will have 10 by 44 is the proportion of female participants who do not own a phone.
Likewise, 14 by 56 is a proportion of male participants who do not own a phone and 42 by 56 is a
proportion of male participants who own a phone. Now what is this 10 by 44? 34 by 44, 14 by 56
and 42 by 56? These are what we refer to as the row relative frequency. What is a row relative
frequency? I divide each cell frequency by its row total so I divide this by 44, this by 44, this by
56 and this by 56. Of course for the column this total also 24 by 100 and 76 by 100. So, I know
76% of my total participants owned a phone and 24% of my total participants did not own a phone.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:57)
And once I do this I see that these are in percentages. 76.27% of the total female participants own
a phone that is what this number gives me. 75% of total male participants own a phone, 76% of
the total participants own a phone. So, what you have in these cells are what are referred to as the
row relative frequencies.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:37)
Now let us look at the second example. In the second example I do the same thing I know the row
totals were 20 for a high income group, 2 people did not own a phone so 2 by 20 which is a 10%,
18 by 20 which is 90%. So, the way I can articulate this is of the high income group or 90% of the
high income group people own a phone whereas 10% of the high income group do not own a
phone.
In the medium income group 40% or 41% of medium income group do not own a phone 60% own
a phone or 59% own a phone and this is 41%, this is 59% own a phone whereas, in the low income
group I have a whopping 64% who do not own phones and a 36% who own phones. In total I have
38 people who do not own 38% who do not own and 62% who own a phone. So, these are what
we refer to as row relative frequencies.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:04)
Similarly to the low relative frequency I have what is called column relative frequencies. Now
what are the type of questions we are expected to answer here. Let us go back to our contingency
table here. So, now I want to know what is the proportion of total participants who were female?
I have 100 participants the proportion is 44 by 100 so I have 44% female and 56% male
participants.
Now of the people who own smart phones. So, I have 76 people who own smart phone I want to
know among this what is the proportion of females among the smart phone owners. The answer to
this question is total number of smart phone owners are 76 of which 34 of them are female. So,
the proportion of people among the smart phone owners who are female are 34 by 76, proportion
of male people who are owners are 42 by 76, proportion of female non owners are 10 by 24,
proportion of male non owners are 14 by 24 these values 10 by 24, 14 by 24, 34 by 76 and 42 by
76 are what we refer to as a column relative frequency.
How do we obtain the column relative frequency? We divide each frequency by their respective
column totals we get the column relative frequency.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:04)
So, you can see the relative frequency is 41% of non owners are female, whereas 58% of non
owners are male whereas when it comes to owning a cellphone 44% are female and about 55% are
male. Totally 44% female and 56% are male. So, these are the column relative frequencies. Now
let us look at the row and column relative frequencies for the second example which was the
income versus the ownership of a smart phone.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:51)
Now when you look at the column relative frequency for the second example you see that 20%
high income, 66% medium income and 14 % low income group. Now among the owners you can
see that among the people who own a phone, 29% of the people who own a phone are from the
high income, 63 are from medium and a low 8% are from the low income groups. Now when it
comes to the people who do not own a phone you see only 5% are from the high income group,
71% are from the medium and 24% from the low income group. So, this is how you compute the
relative frequency.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:53)
We have introduced a concept of a relative frequency. In particular we have seen how to compute
the row relative frequency and the column relative frequency. We now we will see how to use the
concept of a row relative frequency and a column relative frequency to answer questions about
association between variables.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:22)
So, now we address the questions which we started this module with or this lecture with by wanting
to answer whether there is an association between two variables. We first introduce how to set up
what we call a contingency table. A contingency table basically summarizes your bivariate data
then we introduced a notion of both a row relative frequency, to compute the row relative
frequency you measured each or you divided each cell frequency by its row total.
And then we also introduced a notion of a column relative frequency where again I divided each
cell frequency by its column total. Now we will see how to use this concept of a row relative
frequency and a column relative frequency to answer whether there is an association between two
variables or not.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:35)
So, what do we mean by saying or stating the two variables are associated. In other words, we
want to know that whether information about one variable provides some information about
another variable. So, when we are seeking to answer the question whether two variables are
associated actually what we are seeking to answer is whether if I have information about a
particular variable whether it actually gives me something or tells me something about the other
variable. So, to determine whether two categorical variables are associated we will now show how
we use the notion of relative row frequencies and relative column frequencies.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:32)
So, let us look at our relative row or column frequencies. We already know how to compute these
frequencies. If the row relative frequency or the column relative frequencies are the same for all
rows. I repeat, if the row relative frequency or the column relative frequencies are the same for all
rows or columns, then we say the two variables are not associated with each other.
If the row relative frequency or the column relative frequencies are different for some rows then
we say that the two variables are associated with each other. So, if the row relative or the column
relative are same we say they are not associated. If the row relative frequency or the column related
frequency are different, then we say they are associated with each other.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:45)
So, let us go back to our examples to and apply this rule which compares the row relative frequency
and the column relative frequency. So, let us look at this example in this example where I plotted
or I tabulated the gender versus ownership of a phone you can see that when it comes to a
ownership of a phone 24% of a total population did not own a phone, 76% owned a phone.
Now if I am looking at the pattern within the gender you see again 23% of the females did not own
a phone and about 77% of the females owned a phone. When it comes to male again I see about
25% did not own a phone and 75% owned a phone. So, you see that the ownership pattern which
is 24% not owning and 76% owning a phone is consistent with both the female subgroup and the
male subgroup.
You do not see any inconsistencies that is both when you look at females also you see that about
23% are not owning and 77% are owning. In the male also we see about 25% are not owning and
75% are owning. So in general, the ownership pattern does not change depending on the gender.
Let us look at the column frequencies. Again if you look at the column frequencies I had 44 %
female and 56% male.
Now if you look at only owners of the 76 people again I see about about 45% are female and 55%
are males which is almost the same as my total gender diversity. This same percentage among
people who do not own a phone again I have about 42% females and 58% males. So, the gender
diversity also among owners of a phone and not owners of a phone is also the same that is 44%
and around 44% and 56%.
So, both the row relative frequencies and the column relative frequencies are the same for all the
rows and columns. Hence, I can say that both my gender and smart phone are not associated with
each other which is consistent with the definition earlier. Now let us look at the second example.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:02)
When I look at the second example I plot both the row relative frequencies, what are my row
relative frequencies here. So, you have here what were the two variables; the income level and
whether you own a phone or not. Again let us look at it in the first case I know 38% do not own a
phone and 62% own a phone, but when you look at the high income group you see that 90% own
a phone and 10% do not own a phone whereas, in the low income group, 65% do not own a phone
and 36% own a phone.
So, you can see that whether you own a phone or not is playing the percentages of ownership of a
phone actually is different for the high income group and the low income group. The row relative
frequencies are not the same among the categories. If you look at the column relative frequencies
again I have a distribution of 20%, 66% and 14% in my high, medium and low income groups.
If I just look at the owners I have 62% who are owners of which I have about 30% who are coming
from the high income group and only a 8% who come from the low income group. Among the non
owners I have a 5% who are from the high income group and a whopping 24% who are from the
low income group. This is not consistent with my total distribution of my income categories.
Since the row frequencies and the columns frequencies are different among the rows and the
column, I can say that the income and smart phone ownership are actually associated with each
other which is very intuitive. You would expect the ownership of a phone to actually be associated
with your income level whereas the ownership of a phone need not be associated with whether you
are a female or a male and we have seen both the examples which actually have demonstrated this
phenomena.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:50)
So, we have seen how we can use the concept of a relative frequency to decide whether two
variables are associated or not. We again recall we said that if the row relative frequencies or the
column relative frequencies are same for all the rows and columns we say two variables are not
associated with each other. If they are same if they are not same or if they are different we say that
they are associated with each other and we demonstrated this through the two examples which we
have been discussing.
Now, how do I graphically show this result? So, again let us go back to our examples here see that
we have a contingency table which is given here. Recall, when we wanted to summarize a single
categorical variable we used what was called a bar chart. Now, I want to see how these two
variables behave with each other. So, for that what I do is I construct what is called a stacked bar
chart or sometimes it is also referred to as a segmented bar chart. So, a bar chart summarize the
data for a categorical variable where the length of the bars were representing the frequency of
occurrence of a particular category.
This is what a bar chart does. Now a stacked bar chart represents the counts for a particular category
in addition each bar is further broken down to smaller segments. Now let us illustrate what we
mean by this? Now if we are looking at a bar chart for the first example I had two categories the
female category and the male category. Among the female I had 44 females and 56 males and you
see that this is my bar chart.
Now what is a stacked bar chart? Now if I want the second category to be super imposed on this.
What do I mean by this? Again you go back to your contingency table. You see that out of 44 in
the first example I have out of 44 people I have 77.27 who own a phone that was this was 30
actually among the 44 people I have 77. So, this was 34 and this was 10 this was how I had it and
this was a 14, 46.
This was not 46 this was a 14 and this was a 42. So, if I now given this bar chart I know that 77%
so I have constructed this bar chart. In this I want to know what percentage of the female own a
phone so what I can do in that case is I can look at a percentage let me look at another color. So, I
have about 77%t of this who own a phone approximately this is about 77%.
So, of this 44 I have about 77% similarly here I have the same percentage who own the phone here
so this purple shaded area represents the number of people or the proportion of people within each
category who own a phone. I have about 77% who own a phone and this green shaded area
represents the proportion of people among females who do not own a phone and this green area
here represents the proportion of males who do not own a phone.
So, the difference between a staked bar chart and a bar chart is, when I have only the female and
male category I could have. So, this entire bar represented the count of female and this entire bar
represented which was 56 represented the count of female whereas a stacked bar chart in addition
to the so what you can see that in addition to the count of a particular category it breaks it down
into smaller segments.
So, I broken down this entire of 44 into smaller segment. Here again two segments where this
segment represents the owners of or the female owners and the green segments represents the
female non owners. Similarly, this segment represents the male owners and this segment represents
the male non owners of the graph. So, since you have the segmented bars it is called a segmented
bar chart or it is also known as a stacked bar chart.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:53)
How do we construct a stacked bar chart using Google sheet.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:55)
So, now we go back to the contingency table which we had already constructed. I select the data
for which I have the contingency table I am selecting the gender and the no, yes I go to insert chart
in an insert chart I am looking at a stacked column chart. You can see that I am looking at a stacked
column chart. So, you can see that this is the stacked column chart of which you can also see that
I have two genders. Here I have a female I have a male.
This is the gender I have and within the female I have 44 within the male I have 76. 77% of the
female gender is actually owning a phone the red color indicates yes the blue color indicates no.
Again close to 77% of male own a phone again yes. So, within the male bar I have indicated how
many own a phone and how many do not own a phone.
(Refer Slide Time: 29:21)
So, you can see that a stacked bar chart is a good way of summarizing the ownership in a graphical
way. Now you can go back to your Google sheet and you can see that this stacked bar chart give
me the actual counts, but suppose I am interested and this was what we referred to as a standard
stacked bar chart. So, you can go to a chart style go to setup I have a stacked column chart.
Under stacking you can see that I have listed the standard option, but if I click on what I call a
100% stacked bar chart. What a 100% stacked bar chart gives me is you can see that of if I consider
it does not give me the actual counts of a female and male, but what a 100% stacked bar chart
gives me is the proportion of females who own a phone to the proportion who do not own.
And similarly the proportion of males who own a phone to proportion who do not own. Now,
where is a 100% stacked bar chart useful to me. Now suppose I go to a 100% stacked bar chart.
So, where is a 100% stacked bar chart useful.
(Refer Slide Time: 31:07)
You can see that when I am actually not interested in knowing the count of each category, but I
am interested in knowing about a part-to-whole relationship or the proportional relationships I can
use what is a 100% stacked bar chart. Here you can see it very visualize visually it is showing me
that the distribution or ownership of a phone to not having a phone for the category female and
male is almost the same you do not see any sizable difference between the ownership pattern and
gender.
(Refer Slide Time: 31:50)
For the second example when you look at a stacked bar chart. Now if you look at this chart I have
the category 1. 1 you recall was associated with the high income group, 2 was associated with the
medium income group, 3 was associated with the low income group again their order I either have
to maintain a low medium high order or a high medium low order. This you have to maintain the
order you cannot have a low, high, medium order because it is an ordinal data maintain the order
in which you represent the variables.
Now if you look at this high income group yes is the purple, green is the no. You can see that
among the high income group you have more people who own the phone to people who do not
own the phone. In the low income group you have more people who do not own the phone to
people who own the phone and in the medium income group it is almost you have equal number
of people who own a phone to do not own a phone. Graphically this is very clear.
(Refer Slide Time: 33:02)
Now, how does a 100% stacked bar chart look for this example. Now if you look at a 100% stacked
bar chart where I am not interested in the actual counts, but I am interested in looking at how the
100% stacked bar chart looks. You can see this very clearly in the high income group I have a lot
of people who own the phone. In the low income group I have this green is higher than the purple.
Green is the number of people who do not own the phone whereas for medium I have equal number
of the proportion of people who own the phone is equal to the proportion of people who do not
own a phone. So, you can see when you are not interested in the actual counts, but you are
interested in comparing these groups with each other to tell you a story a 100% stacked bar chart
is very useful.
And this story is since you do not you see a varying pattern we can reaffirm what we saw from the
column and row relative frequency that income and ownership are associated with each other.
Whereas, when we looked at gender versus ownership they were almost the same gender and
ownership are not associated with each other.
(Refer Slide Time: 34:36)
So, at the end of this section you should know, you should be able to use the concept of relative
frequency to tell whether two variables are associated with each other. You further validated
through a graphical summary. This graphical summary is what we referred to as the stacked bar
chart.
