Association between categorical and numerical variables
(Refer Slide Time: 0:17)
So, in this portion we are going to understand how to capture the association between a numerical
and a categorical variable. Here I am assuming my categorical variable has only two categories, in
other words if I am looking at gender for example, it has two categories male and female. I could
have another variable which is say income, I could just look at two categories which is just high
category and low category.
So, I am coming my categorical variable has two (variables) two categories and this is referred to
as a dichotomous variable. So, now we are going to see how we summarize the association or
understand the association between a categorical variable and a numerical variable. Let us look at
the following example.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:17)
So, suppose a teacher was interested in knowing if female students perform better than the male
students in her class. So, what does she collect? She collected data from 20 students. Now these
20 students and the marks obtained in the subject she is teaching on 100. A very small subset of
the data set, so you can, you can see that there are 20 students. I will just show it, show the data to
you.
So, I have the first student is a girl who has obtained 71 on 100, the second student is again a girl
who has obtained 67 on 100, the sixth student is a male who has obtained 83 on 100, the twentieth
student is a male who has obtained 90 on 100. So, these are the marks of 20 students and the data
that is recorded is the gender. Now, gender is a categorical variable, now the levels of these
categorical variables are two. The first level is a female, the second level is a male, it is nominal
because there is no order in this categorical variable.
Whereas marks is a numerical variable, it is can take any value, here I have seen that 71 out of
100, 67 out of 100, this is a numerical variable. Now, we are interested in understanding weather
females perform better than males, so we want to know what is the association between, first of
all we are asking the question, is there an association between gender and the marks, or are they
not associated with each other.
We introduced a concept which is referred to as a point bi-serial correlation measure. So, let us
start by looking at a scatter of this data. To look at a scatter of this data what I first do is the
following, I code my categorical variable. What do I mean by coding my categorical variable? I
have gender female and male here so I am just coding it, because now I am looking at whether I
can quantify the correlation between these two variables. So if I just write for example, if I just try
and see I will put a correlation measure and I, you can see that it returns an error because it says
that correlation the (valid), it has no valid input data.
It has no valid input data because this is categorical and it is text. So, let me code this variable. So,
this coding I am just arbitrarily choosing female as 1 and male as 0, so you can see that this data
is coded in the following form. So, here I have two data sets, this could be the data obtained in one
test and this could be the data or this could be the marks obtained in of the same 20 people in one
test and this could be the marks obtained of the same 20 people in another test.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:52)
So, let us first start with a scatter plot of this data. So, again I go and I plot a scatter plot. I do not
want a line chart, I want a scatter plot. And within the scatter plot I am using my column 
labels because I, column 
 is taking only two values, I am using column 
 as labels. And within
this column 
 again what I do is, I go and I customize it further by looking at the major spacing
time which is step and I am putting a step value of 1. So, you can see that my, I have constructed
my scatter plot which, in which I have my 
, I can go back to my titles, the title is gender coded
versus marks.
My horizontal axis I have gender and on my vertical axis I have marks out of 100. And the way I
can interpret this scatter plot is, you can see that this 0, 0 represents a male here and 1 represents
a female here. So you can see that whether it is male or female all of them have obtained marks in
the same range. So, the scatter plot tells us an important story here and the story which the scatter
plot, this scatter plot tells us is irrespective of gender the distribution of marks seems to be the
same, because both female and male seem to have performed equally well in a particular range.
But now let us look at the second dataset.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:00)
So, if I go back and change this data range, let me look at the data range taking so, it is sorry 
1 to 
21 that is a second data range of my data. So, for this data range 
1 to 
21. Now, you
see that there is some difference. What is difference you notice here? You can see that 0 or the
males are clustered in this region and females are clustered in this region to indicate females have
performed better, they have obtained higher marks than the males in general.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:47) 20:03, 22:11
So, you see that in the earlier case, so you can see that in the earlier case that is in this case, the
first case I see that 1 is again female. 0 is a male. And you can see that the marks obtained are the
same. Whereas in the second case again I can see that female seem to have obtained higher marks
than the males in general. This is a distribution of marks for males and the females. So, the question
is, again here I do not have a line, I have just these points. Fitting a line for this kind of data is of
no use to me, so how do I summarize the strength of this association.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:35)
For this we have a measure which we refer to as a point bi-serial correlation coefficient. So, let 
be a numerical variable and 
 be a categorical variable. In our example, 
 is my marks it is the
numerical variable, 
 is the gender which is the categorical variable. I am assuming a dichotomous
variable, gender has two levels, again I have a level of female and male. How do I compute the
point bi-serial correlation between these two variables? The first thing which we do is the
following.
We go back, you group the data into two sets based on the value of the dichotomous variable 
that is I am saying 
 takes a value 0 or 1. Here in my example I have assumed 
 takes the value if
the gender is male and 
 takes the 1 if the gender is female. And that is how I have coded my data.
So, you can go back and see that this is how we have coded the data here. So, if I have 
, it takes
the value 1 if it is a female and 0 if it is a male. Group the data into two sets based on the value.
So, this data again I have, so this data I have 1, 71 this is the same data.
So, in this two sets I have two groups. What are the two groups? One is a female group and one is
the male group. So, in the first step, in the second step you calculate the mean values of the two
groups. How do I do this? One way to do this is, I can just find out what are the total number of
females. So, if I count the total number of females it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 females. So
out of 20, I have 12 females and 8 males. So, I have 8 males, so my 0, this is my male.
So, if I am summarizing it males, I have 8 males and I have 12 female students. So, the proportion
is nothing but
which is going to be 0.4 and 12
 which is 0.6. So, that is how and I am
referring that to 
0 and 
1 . Now, what is the next step? The second step says, calculate the mean
values of these two groups. So, how many females do I have? I have 12 females. What is the mean
value?
It is going to be 71, 71 + 67 + 65 +, so forth I can keep doing 91 + 85 + 69 + 75 + 79 + 86 +
75 + 90 + 91, which is 944. A simpler way to compute this is through using sum if function. How
do you use a sum if function will be taught in the tutorial. It is a simpler (func) way that is if I have
a female and just computing all those data points which correspond to the female, so I can use
what is called the sum if function. So, this 944 represents the total marks obtained by female
students.
Similarly, 658 is the total marks obtained by all men students or male students put together. Now,
what is the mean of this group? I have 12 students in this group, so the mean of this group which
is going to be nothing but 944 
which is equal to 78.66. So, 
1 is giving me the mean of the
female group. What is the average mark of the female students? Similarly the average mark of the
male students is 82.25. So, if you go back to step two, it is saying that compute 
 and 
which are the mean values of the group.
So, 
 here is the mean of the group of male students, 
1 the mean of the group of female
students. Then I can find out what is the proportion of observation. Again I know that 
0 is going
to be 8 
1 = 20, this is the proportion of observations of the group which I am coding 0
and this is the group I am coding 1. Finally 
 is my numerical, it is a single numerical
variable which is the marks. Remember when I have numerical variable, I can define what I call a
standard deviation measure which is telling me about the variability of that particular variable.
So, 
 is the standard deviation of this variable. So, variable, entire variable which is 
2 to
Then
point

 divided by 
1 . Certain books use 
 and 
1 , 
0 is the
number of observations. So, 
 is basically 
0 by total let, if 
 is the total number of
observation and 
0 is the number of observations in my 0
 group, the group that is coded 0, 
is a number of observations in the group that is coded 1.
Then 
1 is 
. Some books or some authors instead of looking at
this as 
1 use a sample correction which is (the) only this term is replaced by
. So, you can see again this 
 1 which keeps playing a role always
when you talk about sample characteristics. So, this is how you compute a point bi-serial
correlation coefficient of a data which has both numerical and categorical variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:19)
So, for this dataset again going back I have computed the point bi-serial coefficient which is . 188
and this for the next data set is 
.96. Again is there a difference between . 188 and 
.188. See,
this 0 and 1 I could have change female to be 0 and male to be 1 then I would have got a different
sign. That is what I have computed here, there is no, since this is, there is no order, there is no hard
and fast rule that female should be 1 and male should be 0. I could have change the ordering.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:03)
So, I could have changed the ordering to be if it is female it is 0 and it is 1 here, otherwise. So,
you can see that there is a flip in my this one, I have 12 males. So now this would become a female,
because I had 12 females, sorry this would become a female now. This would be a male. 8 out of
12, this has, the standard deviation remains the same because I have not changed anything. My 
now is going to be your 
22 by 
22, 
 is going to be
Now, you can see that the point bi-serial which was earlier . 188 is now 
.188. So depending on
what is your coding, you are going to get this point bi-serial correlation coefficient that is the key
difference between what I wanted to, what I wanted you to observe between numerical data, I have
a strong positive, or a strong negative, here it depends on how you are looking at the coding and
that decides on what is your point bi-serial correlation coefficient.
So, whether it is a very, so here I can, so basically in absolute terms this would lie between 0 and
1 and it is closer to 0, it says that in this dataset my gender really has no association with the marks.
And that is sort of validated by my scatter plot also for my first example which said that irrespective
of which gender you are from, your marks seem to be distributed in the same way.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:15)
Now, if we go to the second dataset, which is this 
 and 
 columns and do the same exercise for
this dataset. Let me revert to my earlier coding of female is, does not make a difference but I just
wanted to revert to my earlier coding and compute the point bi-serial. So, now again there are
couple of things which I want you to see here. You can see that the total marks obtained by females
here is way high than the total marks obtained by males, whereas here it was 944, 658, here it is
much higher.
If you look at the group means, the means in the first example were close to each other, the total
mean of the male group was about 82 and the female was about 78, in fact males had a higher
mean that the females here. Whereas here you can see that the males are, the female mean is about
close to 90 whereas the male mean is close to 70, there is a huge difference, here there is not too
much of a difference.
The standard deviation is again not very different this is 9.5 and 10.8 they are not very different
from each other, but when you look at the point bi-serial correlation measure, this is very much
close to one, in fact it is . 963. Again that is something which is validated here by saying that yes
the gender seems to play a role when I am seeking the association between gender and marks in
this example.
So, we stop here. What we have seen in this week is understand about association between
variables. We looked at association between categorical variables, we looked at association
between numerical variables and we looked at association between a numerical and a categorical
variable. Here we just restricted our attention to a categorical variable which has only two
categories and we introduced what is called the point bi-serial correlation coefficient.
