Permutations and Combinations 
 Permutations: Distinct Objects
(Refer Slide Time: 00:13)
We now introduce what is a Permutation. Permutations and Combinations are extremely
important when we are going to learn about probability. So, what is, we formally define what
is a permutation? We can formally define what is a permutation as an ordered arrangement of
all or some of n objects. I want to know you all to notice something very carefully. We have
3, qualified the statement with 3 important words. The first word is ordered, the second is
arrangement, and the third is n objects.
Now, for, now, we are going that assume that these n objects are distinct objects. Now, what
do I mean by distinct object? For example, if I take A, B, and C, these could be 3 people.
When I am referring to 3 people, they are distinct people. So, first we are going to
understand, and then we will start looking at what would happen if they are not distinct. For
example, I can again, so n = 3 here, A, B, C are distinct. I can again take n = 3 objects or I
can have an A, A and B.
It could be a case that I have, 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. So here, I do not have all the 3 of
them distinct, but if I had a red, blue and a yellow ball, all of them were distinct. So, now, a
permutation is an ordered arrangement. So, the key we need to notice here is this idea of
order. And this is what defines what is a permutation.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:05)
So, what is a permutation? Let us start with a very simple example, where we will extend
what we learned about the fundamental principle of counting. So, what is this example? So,
let us look at A, B and C. When we look at A, B and C, the number of objects or number of
articles or number of things, whatever we want to refer to it, n equal to 3, because I have a A,
I have a B, and I have a C. Now, let us look at all possible arrangements taking all at a time.
In a sense, I want to see what are the all the possible arrangements of this A, B and C when I
take all of them at a time.
So, the way I can look at it is, the another way to look at it is, I have 3 boxes, and I am
looking at filling these 3 boxes with this A, B, C. And I want to know how I can do it, how
many ways I can do this. So, you can start simply, intuitively. If I put a A here, let me fix the
first box with an A. In the second box, I could have a B or a C. So, A, B, C, and A, C, B are
possible ways of filling this box.
The another way I can look at it is, I can start with a B. Similarly, the second box and the
third box. Second box could be a A, in which I can have the third box, only a C. Now, I am
allow, I am not allowing the same repetition. When do I say I am allowing a repetition? For
example, if I have, if I want to pick up some balls, I pick it up, I note the number and put it
back. I am not allowing that. I am not allowing the repetitions in this case.
Similarly, if I have a B, I could have a C and a A. If I have the first, if my first blank is a C,
first box is a C, the second could be a A, the third could be a B. The first as a C, the second
could be a B and third could be a A. So, I can enumerate the number of possible
arrangements when I am taking all the 3 alphabets here, A, B, C, which are distinct. If I count
the number of possible arrangements, I have a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:06)
So, the total number of possible arrangements that are possible here are 6. So, ABC, ACB,
BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA. Now, let us look at a slightly, so if you go back and see in the
definition, I said it is an ordered arrangements of all or some. So, it is not necessary that I
should take all the 3 of them together. So, I am interested, the second thing I am interested in
knowing is, what are the possible arrangements of this ABC if I only take 2 of them?
(Refer Slide Time: 05:46)
That is I am choosing 2 out of A,B, and C. How many ways can I choose it, we will come to
this in a quite a time and we are going to talk about combinations. But I can look at A, B and
C, taking 2 at a time, I can choose A and B. And within A and B, I can arrange them as AB or
BA. Similarly, I can choose B and C. Within B and C, CB, because this ordering is different
from this ordering. And I can look at AC and CA. So, when I am taking out of n = 3, I am
taking 2 at a time, I see, again the number of possible arrangements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. In
this case, both the first answer and second answer are the same.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:51)
But then after this, we will, let us look at another example where I am looking at now, n = 4.
And I have A, B, C, and D. Now, one way to look at it as you can fix A in my first place. And
I know that B, C, D, if I look at B, C, D from a earlier example, I know if I have 3 places, the
second, third and fourth, and within, between BCD, the way I can fill these 3 places with B,
C and D are 6. So, if I fix A in my first place, I get 6 ways of getting hold of different
possible arrangements. Is it clear?
So, the second thing, if I fix B, I can do the similar thing. I have a A, C and D to choose from
for the 3 places. And I also know again that there are 6 ways of doing this. Similarly, if I fix a
C, I can choose from A, B and D. And again, there are 6 ways of doing this. If I fix D as the
first place, I have A, B and C. And there are again 6 ways of doing this, giving me 6 + 6 + 6
+ 6, a total number of 24 arrangements, when n = 4. I can list all the arrangements in that
following way.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:35)
So, I have 6 from A, 6 from B. I can, again I can show you that I have. So, these are the 6
from A, I have 6 from B. I have 6 from C and 6 from D. And the total number of possible
arrangements, the total number of possible arrangements in this case, you can see is 6 + 6 +6
+ 6. I have 24 possible arrangements of A, B, C, D taking all at a time.
Now let us look at the same thing. Now if I am taking looking at the same possible
arrangements A, B, C, D but I am now taking 2 at a time. Now again, if I have if I take A as
my first object, the second could be a B, C or D. So, it could be AB, AC or AD. But that AB,
I can have another arrangement BA, CA and DA. So again, with B, I could either have a A,
but I already have listed that here. So, BC, BD, which will give me CB and DB. I have CD
and DC.
So, the total number of arrangements I have, taking 2 at a time are AB, AC, AD, BA, BC,
BD, CA, CB, CD, DA, DB, and DC, I have 12 arrangements of taking 2 at a time. Now, let
us formalize this example to define what is a permutation?
(Refer Slide Time: 10:35)
So, we are now ready to have the definition of a permutation. I have n objects of this, I am
choosing r object. So, r 
n. In my first example, when n was 3, I looked at ABC, I took at all
at a time for my r was also 3. The second thing I took n = 3 again, ABC, but I was looking at
2 at a time, so my r was 2.
My third example, n was 4. I looked at ABCD, I again looked at all at a time, r was for 4. My
fourth example, I had a ABCD, I again looked at 2 at a time, my r was 2. So, the question I
am asking now is, how many possible permutations, these arrangements are also referred to
as permutations. So, the question we are asking is, how many possible permutations are of r
objects from a collection of n distinct?
(Refer Slide Time: 11:42)
It is very important for us to understand that we are having it as distinct objects is given by
the formula. So now, let us put in r blocks, 1, 2, 3. So, this is my first block, this is my second
block, this is my third block, I can go so forth to r block. The number of ways, I can fill in
this first block is n base. Now, once I have chosen from these n distinct objects, I have chosen
1 object to fill in this block. I do not have that available with me for the remaining. So,
number of ways, I can fill in the second is n - 1.
So now, I have, the first and second are filled with 2 objects from these n objects. So, third, I
can fill in n - 2 possible ways. So forth I can go, the rth, I can fill in n 
 (r 
 1) possible ways.
So, the first one can be filled in n way, second in n - 1 ways, third in n - 2 ways and the rth
can be filled in n 
 (r 
 1) ways.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:20)
Again, using the fundamental multiplication rule of counting, I know the total number of
ways I can fill, these r boxes n(n - 1) (n - 2) ..(n - r + 1), which can be written formally as n(n
- 1) (n - 2) ..(n - r + 1). It is denoted by 
 . The way I can express this is, the collection from
a collection of n objects, I am choosing r objects, this is given by 
Now, let us look at this n into, now let us look at n into n minus 1 into n minus 2. So, I know
nPr from the fundamental theorem of counting is given by this expression. Now, can I
simplify this expression? If you look at it, if I can multiply my numerator with n minus r into
n minus r minus 1 up to 1, I divide both numerator and denominator with the same quantity.
The numerator now is nothing but n factorial. The denominator is nothing but n minus r
factorial. So, I have a simplified expression for my nPr, which is n factorial by n minus r
factorial.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:53)
So, nPr is n factorial by n minus r factorial. Now, going back to the examples we have just
seen, we can see that there are certain special cases of this formula. What are the special
cases of this formula? What is nP0? The special cases of this formula, if you look at nP0, I
apply the same formula, it is n factorial by n minus 0 factorial, n minus 0 is again n. So, I
have n factorial by n factorial, which is 1. So, what does this mean? It means that when I am
looking at no object in nP0, I have only 1 ordered arrangement of 0 objects. Now, if I am
looking at the second special case, what is the second special case?
(Refer Slide Time: 16:06)
The second special case is, let me look at, nP1, what is nP1? Again, nP1 equal to n factorial
by n minus 1 factorial. Now, I can write this numerator as n into n minus 1 factorial. i divided
by n minus 1 factorial, so I have n as the answer. Now, nP1 is n, which is, this also can be
viewed as the number of ways I can fill in 1 blank when I can choose from n objects.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:44)
So, nP1 is n. There are n ways of choosing 1 objects from available and distinct objects. The
third thing I want, we want to see is what is nPn. nPn is again number of ways of choosing n
objects from an available n objects. So, nPn, if we apply the formula again, is n factorial by n
minus n factorial, which is n factorial by 0 factorial. We already know, 0 factorial is 1, which
is n factorial. So, nPn is the same as n factorial, which we have, we can see that this actually
is what we got when we applied the fundamental theorem of multiplication, theorem of
counting.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:43)
So, I have nPn equal to n factorial, where I am arranging the n distinct objects in n factorial
ways.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:55)
So, this is the main permutation formula, which tells me the possible permutations of r
objects from n distinct objects. The key thing to remember here is repetition is not allowed.
That is a key thing too. So, in that case, I have nPr is n factorial by n minus r factorial.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:32)
So, let us apply that to what we have seen so far. Now, when, the first example my n was 3, I
am taking all at a time, so my r is also equal to 3. So, we can say that this would reduce the
nPn, which is n factorial when n equal to 3. I know 3 factorial is 6.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:03)
And I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which is the total number of ways in my first example, which we
discussed. So, in the first example, I have nPr, which is equal to 6, which is nothing but n
factorial. Now, let us look at the second case.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:17)
Now in the second case, I am looking at, again I have 3, n equal to 3, but my r equal to 2. So,
nPr is n factorial by n minus r factorial, which is 3 factorial by 1 factorial, which is again 3
factorial, which is 6.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:40)
So here, in this case, my n equal to r 3, and r equal to 2, and I have the total number of
possible arrangements is again 6. Now let us look at this third example, which we considered.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:55)
In the third example, I had all possible arrangements of ABCD taking all at a time. So here,
my n is equal to 4, my r equal to 4. It is again nPr, which is the same as nPn, which is equal to
n factorial, which I know here n equal to 4, n factorial is 4 factorial, which is 24. And I have
24 possible arrangements here.
(Refer Slide Time: 20: 35)
So, you can see that in this case, I have an, I am looking at all at a time, I have 4 factorial, and
which is given by 24.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:43)
The last example, which we considered was, again ABCD taking 2 at a time again. Again my
n is 4, my r is 2, my nPr equal to 4 factorial by 4 minus 2 factorial, which is 4 factorial by 2
factorial, I have 12 as the answer, and I can see that matches with what I have here 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. I had 12 possible arrangements, which is nothing but what is my nPr
in that case, 12.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:24)
So, this is the first permutation formula, which is obtained when I have n objects, n distinct
objects, and I am taking r from these n distinct objects, I am not allowing repetition.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:43)
Let us look at a few applications of this formula. Suppose I want to form a committee of 8
people. The question is, how many ways can we choose a chairman and a vice chairman,
assuming 1 person cannot hold more than 1 position? So, the first part, which we notice is 1
person cannot hold more than 1 position reflects the non-repetitive behaviour of our,
whatever requirement which we have.
From a committee of n (persons), 8 persons, so this n equal to 8. I want to see how many
ways can we choose a chairman and vice chairman. So, the r equal to 2, how many ways that
is also something which I can, this one, so I need to know whether a chairman, whether if I
have A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, these are the 8 people. A could be a chairman, B could be vice
chairman, B could be chairman, A could be vice chairman. So, these 2 orders are different.
So, this is a chairperson, this is a vice chairperson. So, these 2 orders are different. So,
applying the formula, I have 8 factorial by 8 minus 2 factorial, which is 8 into 7.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:27)
So, the total number of ways I can do this is 8 into 7, which is 56 ways.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:33)
Now, let us look at the next application. In the next application, I am looking at the number
of 4-digit numbers that can be formed using digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Again, no digit is repeated.
So, my n in this case is 5, I am choosing from 5 distinct objects, I am looking at number of 4digit numbers, so I have four 4 blanks. So, my r equal to 4. And I am asking the question,
what is nPr again? It is 5p4, which is nothing but 5 factorial to 5 minus four factorial, which
is same as 5 factorial by 1 factorial, which is 5 factorial.
(Refer Slide Time: 24:29)
And I know that 5 factorial is equal to my 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1, so I have a result,
which is 120 ways of creating these 4-digit numbers or 4-digit codes, whatever we want. Let
us look at an example. Let us slightly modify the application, which we looked. So earlier, I
said find the number of 4-digit numbers, which can be formed using these digits. But now
suppose I am saying that I want to know how many even numbers can be formed. I know if I
want to count the number of even numbers, the last thing can either be a 2 or a 4. I am fixing
the last digit here. So, if I fix the last digit, I have 3 blank spaces that are available.
Now, once I fixed the last digit, these, now my r becomes 3, and I can choose from the
remaining. So, if it is 2, and r is 3, I have only remaining 1, 3, 4, and 5, from which I can
choose the remaining 3 numbers. And that can be done in 4p3 ways, which is 4 factorial by 4
minus 3 factorial, which is 4 into 3 into 2 ways. Similarly, if I fix a 4, I have again r equal to
3 blanks, and I have 1, 2, 3 and 5, my n equal to 4. Again, I can choose it in 4p3 ways, which
is again 4 into 3 into 2 ways.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:28)
So, if I add these 2 up, I see that the total number of ways is 24 plus 24, which is 48. So, you
can see that we can use this simple formula of permutation to count the number of
arrangements that can arise in various situations.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:54)
Moving forward, let us look at what would happen, another example, let us look at another
application. Suppose I have 6 people who have gone to a cinema. In cinemas again, lets again
remember that what we are talking about here is arranging people in a line, in a linear order.
So again, if you look at cinema or stadium, typically people sit in a row. So, I go to a cinema,
I have 10 seats. So, these are the 10 seats, I can number my seats as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and
10. These are the 10 seats that are available to me. So, 6 people go to a cinema. So, my n
equal to 10. 6 people go to a cinema.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:56)
So, the question, the first question we are asking here is, how can I makes the 6 people sit in
this row? I have 10 available seats, how many ways can they do if my people can sit
anywhere? So, if these 6 people can sit anywhere, I know that n equal to 10, my r equal to 6
and number of arrangements applying my formula is 10p6.mSo, the first answer is, well if I
can sit anywhere, the answer is 10p6, these are the number of ways 6 people can sit in
available 10 seats.
But now, suppose I am giving another thing is all the empty seats are next to each other. How
do we solve this problem? For example, I cannot have a situation of this kind. I again have
the 10 seats, I cannot have a person occupying this seat, this seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, these
empty seats are not next to each other, whereas this is permitted. So, this is permitted for me.
I can have all the 4 empty seats next to each other, or even this is permitted.
What we need to understand here is these four empty seats form a block. And I can consider
these 4 empty seats as a distinct object in it, because I am not allowing them to move. Now, if
these 4 empty seats are considered as 1 distinct object, then the total number of distinct
objects are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. I need to see how many arrangements can be done, that is
this. So now, I have 7 places available to me. I want to set these 6 people in these 7 places,
and that can be done in 7p6 ways.
So, these are application of this simple, these are applications of the simple formula of
arranging r objects out of n distinct objects when repetition is not allowed.
(Refer Slide Time: 30:57)
Now, suppose, let us go to the next case, where I want to know about what is that number of
permutations or where a number of arrangements when the objects are not distinct, when I am
looking at repetitions, so when I am looking at the same (example). So now, let us move
forward to understand what is the number of possible arrangements again taking all at a time,
but now I am allowing repetition. So, let us look at the first example. I looked at ABC.
Now, I did not allow repetition earlier, so when I looked at the 3 boxes to be filled, once I fill
in A in one of the boxes, I do not have A available to fill in B or C. So, only either B or C
could get into the second box. So, I had a A, so I had a A with BC or CB. But suppose I am
allowing repetitions, so if I fill A in my first box, A is available for the second box, A is
available for the third box also. So, AAA is a valid arrangement, because I am allowing
repetition. I am not saying that once I have put a particular thing in a box, that is not available
for filling up the other 2 boxes.
(Refer Slide Time: 32:45)
So, if you look at this case, so I am looking at the number of possible arrangements. So, AAA
is a possible arrangement, AA with B is a possible arrangement. So, the number of possible
arrangements, now if any, the first box can be filled with A or B or C, the second box can be
filled with A or B or C, the third box can be filled with a A or B or C. So, there are 3 choices
available to fill this box A, there are 3 choices available to fill the box, second box, there are
3 choices available to fill the third box, because all the choices are available for all the boxes.
(Refer Slide Time: 34:17)
So, the total number of ways I can fill all the 3 boxes together are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and you can see that, that goes all the way up to, and you can see that,
that 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, I have up to 27.
(Refer Slide Time: 34:27)
So, let us look at the second example. Now, suppose I am looking at the same possible
arrangements but now I am taking 2 at a time. So, I have 2 boxes. The first box can be an A,
the second box can be an A, so AA. First is an A, second can be a B. First is an A, second can
be a C. Similarly, first is a B, second can be an A. First as a B, second can be a B. First is a B,
I have a BC. C goes with an A, B or C, I am allowing repetition, so you can see the total
number of possible arrangements possible in this case is 9.
(Refer Slide Time: 35:14)
So, we can actually come up with a formula to, so I have 9, if I take 3 objects, 2 at a time, I
allow for repetitions, I can see that the total number of possible arrangements is 9 here.
(Refer Slide Time: 35:29)
So, let us look at what is the permutation formula. So, I have in this case, n, again I have n
distinct objects. I am taking again r objects out of this n distinct objects, r is less than or equal
to n. So, how do I, I am allowing repetitions, so if I have r blocks or r blanks, this is my first,
this is my second, this is my third and this is my rth block. The first block can be filled with
any of the n objects. The second can also be filled with any of the n objects. Third can also be
filled with any of the n objects. The rth block can also be filled with any of the n objects.
Again, I apply the multiplication rule of counting. If I apply the multiplication rule of
counting, the total number of ways I can fill all these r boxes is nothing but n into n into n r
times, which is n to the power of r. So, we can see that this is, this second rule of
permutation, where I again have n distinct objects, I am choosing r distinct objects from this n
distinct objects, but I am allowing repetition.
(Refer Slide Time: 36:59)
So, how do, what is the formula there? So, if I have r objects from n distinct objects,
repetition is allowed. It is given by the formula, the formula is given here, it is n to the power
of r, this is what we have seen.
(Refer Slide Time: 37:18)
So, in the earlier example, when I had an A,B,C and I am taking all at a time, I had n equal to
3, r is also equal to 3. 3 to the power of 3 is 27.
(Refer Slide Time: 37:31)
And we saw that we had the 27 arrangements, which were possible.
(Refer Slide Time: 37:37)
Similarly, when I looked at this case taking 2 at a time, my n equal to 3, r equal to 2, n to the
power of r is 3 to the power of 2, which is 9. And we have seen that there are 9 distinct
arrangements possible in this case.
(Refer Slide Time: 38:01)
So, let us look at a summary of what we have learned so far in this topic. So, we started with
permutations when objects are distinct. We again look at 2 cases in this case. One is when
repetitions are not allowed. And the second when repetitions are allowed. When repetitions
are not allowed, the number of possible permutations of r objects from a collection of n
objects is given by and denoted by the formula nPr, which is n factorial by n minus r
factorial. When repetitions are allowed, it is given by n to the power of r. This is what we
have learned so far.
