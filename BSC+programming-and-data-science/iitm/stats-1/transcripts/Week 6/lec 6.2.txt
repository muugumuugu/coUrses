Permutations and Combinations 
 Permutations: Objects not distinct and Circular
permutations
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
Now, let us look at the case when the objects are not distinct. So, when we looked at the case
when the objects were distinct, we looked at different ways of arranging A, B, C. Now, these
A, B, C could be people, it could be objects, but they are distinct. But now suppose I have a
case where they are not distinct. So, let us look at an example where I am looking at how do I
rearrange the letters in the word 
DATA
. Now, if you look at the word DATA and just look
at this as alphabets, I see that D, A and T are the 3 distinct objects or distinct alphabets,
because A appears twice.
Now, I am asking how many ways can it be done. To understand this, let us do the following,
I will write the DATA, I will write as 
1 and 
2 . Basically, 
1 and 
2 are the same alphabet,
but I know how to find out for this, I already know that if I have 
2 , my 
 = 4, I am
taking all at a time so this is going to be 
!, this is what we have already seen because it is
taking all at a time is 
!. So, I can have 
! which is 4! which is again 4 
 2 which is 24
ways of arranging 
Let us look at these two arrangements 
2 and 
. Now these two arrangements are different when I consider 
1 and 
2 as distinct objects. But
we know that 
1 or 
2 are essentially the same object. So, these two together will just give
me one arrangement which is DATA, whether the first A comes before the second A or the
second A comes before this first A is irrelevant. So, 
2 and 
1 give me the same
arrangement which is DATA. Similarly, 
 and 
 these two together will again
give me the same arrangement which is ATAD.
So, for every two arrangements which I had in my original, original which is these 24
arrangements, I can see that every 2 arrangements will give me 1 arrangement that is,
whenever I have 
1 and 
2 , 
2 and 
1 , that which can I have 2! ways because when I have 2
elements, I have 2! ways. So, I can erase that for every 2 I have 1 arrangement distinct
because these two are the same. In other words, out of these 24 arrangements, I can eliminate
half of them so I get 12 arrangements when I have one alphabet which is appearing twice.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:01)
In other words, if I look at the 3 distinct alphabets, I have the possible arrangements that are
possible are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and how we have arrived at these 12
arrangements is what we had just discussed.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:26)
And the logic is I treat both the A
s as 
1 and 
2 . I looked them as distinct objects in which
case I know I have 4! ways to do it, but I know effectively 
1 and 
2 are the same object
hence I divide the total number of arrangements which is 4! by 2! and I get that the total
number of ways the letters in DATA can be arranged is 2! which is 12 ways.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:06)
I can generalise this formula to say that the number of permutations of 
 objects when 
them are of one kind, so in DATA, my 
 was 4 so I can generalise this into what I refer to as
the permutation formula. The number of permutations of n objects when p of them are of one
kind and rest distinct. So, what are the 
 of them here? 
 = 4, because I have 4 objects but I
have p of them, I have 2 of them A which are of one kind and other at distinct equal to 2! and
I get the answer to be 12.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:58)
Now, let us extend this idea. Let us look at the same idea and say that now suppose I want to
rearrange the letters in the word STATISTICS. How many ways can it be done? Now, if you
look at this STATISTICS, I look at now the distinct alphabets in this word STATISTICS.
Now if you look at the distinct alphabets, I have a S, I have a T, I have a A, I have an I and I
have a C. The total number of alphabets in this word is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Now, of 
10, I have 3 S, I have 3 T
s. I have a 1 A, I have a 2 I and I have a 1 C. So, this adds up to
In other words, of this 
 = 10 alphabets, I have say 3, I have 3 S, so I have 
1 of one kind,
the first kind which is 
. So, 
1 = 3 of the first kind, 
2 = 3 of second kind. What is my first
kind? My first kind is S, my second kind if T. I have 
3 = 1 of third kind, my third kind is a
4 = 2 of fourth kind which is an I, this is A, this is I and 
5 = 1 of fifth kind which is C.
So, how many possible arrangements can be done in this case?
(Refer Slide Time: 8:06)
The formula that governs this of a thing which is just an extension of what we have seen
before is that the number of permutations when of 
 objects, when 
1 is of one kind, 
2 of
second kind and 
 of third 
 kind is 
In my STATISTICS example, we have already seen my 
 = 10, 
1 = 3, so I have, 
2 = 3,
3 = 1, then I had a 2, 
5 = 1, so my total number of permutations 
 3!, 3!, 1!, 2!and 1! is
the total number of things in this STATISTICS thing and you can see that, that is equal to,
that value is equal to 50400.
So, if you apply the formula, the total number of arrangements that are possible out of this
word STATISTICS is 50400. So, we have applied this when objects are not distinct formula
to the STATISTICS example.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:39)
So, what we have learned so far is when I am looking at linear ordering that is by linear
ordering, I am arranging objects or things or people in a row, then the number of
permutations of 
 objects when 
 of them are of one kind and the rest distinct =
number of objects when 
1 is of one kind, 
2 of second kind, 
 of 
 kind is 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:17)
So, so far what we have seen is how do we count the number of arrangements when I am
arranging 
 distinct or 
 objects, it could be distinct or not distinct objects in a linear row or
in a linear fashion. But sometimes we might we might be interested in knowing about the
number of ways we can arrange people in a nonlinear and the most common thing is if I have
to arrange people in a circle. Then I am interested in knowing how many ways can I do it?
For example, suppose I have a round table, I am interested in knowing how can I seat 4
people in a round table? So, I have a round table, I want to know how can I seat 4 people.
Again, let me assume the 4 people are A, B, C, and D, they are distinct. I want to know how
can they sit in this table. Now suppose A occupies this position, I can have one arrangement
where B occupies this position, and D occupies this position.
Now, if you look at this arrangement, you can see that B is next to A and next to C. So, B is
between A and C. Now, this is same as if B is next to C and A and D, so this arrangement is
same as this arrangement. The linear equivalence of this arrangement is A, B, C, D, whereas
the linear equivalence of this is B, C, D, A.
A, B, C, D is different from B, C, D, A when we are talking about linear arrangements. But
when you are looking at a circular arrangement, this arrangement is the same as this
arrangement. So, you can see that it is circular arrangements need to be counted in a different
way and that is what we are going to learn now. So, let us look at formulising this notion.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:44)
So, I have, first I will consider two cases again when clockwise and anticlockwise are
different and when they are the same. So, I said that when you are looking at A, B, C, D, I
know the possible suppose I fix A, I know it is a B, C, D. I know A, B, D, C; A, C, B, D; A,
C, D, B; A, D, B, C and A, D, C, B. This is already something which we have seen. This has
6 possible linear arrangements if I fix A in one slot.
Now, if I fix B in the first slot, let me look at what are the possible arrangements here if I fix
B, I can have a A, C, D again I am not allowing repetitions. B, I can have a B, A, D, C with
B, C, A, D; B, C, D, A; B, D, A, C and a B, D, C, A. Now each one of these arrangements
were distinct when I looked at a linear ordering. Now, let us look at these two A, B, C, D and
let me look at this following B, C, D, A. Now, A, B, D, C corresponds to this circular
arrangement. B, C, D, A corresponds to this arrangement.
Similarly, C, D, A, B corresponds to this arrangement and D, A, B, C correspond to this
arrangement and we can actually see that these 4 circular arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the
same arrangements.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:11)
In other words, when we want to compute the circular arrangements, one way to look at it is
A, B, D, C, these are the same so the way I can look at it is I fix, so I have a circle. In, within
this circle if I fix the first or one position in the circle, the other 3 positions that are available
if I fix this position in the circle, the other 3 positions that are available are position 1, 2 and 3
and this can be filled with the 3 available alphabets which are B, C, D and that can be done in
3! ways which is equal to 6.
So, if you look at these arrangements A, B, C, D is different from A, C, D, B is different from
A, D, B, C which is different from A, D, C, B, which is different from A, B, D, C which is
different from A, C, D, B. So, I have 6 distinct arrangements of people around a table. So, I
fixed A. Now, if I fix B, I can do the same thing. So, B, A, C, D is one of the arrangements.
But if I look at B, A, C, D, that is the same as A, C, D, B. It is the same arrangement.
So, if I fix C, I have C, A, B, D as one of the arrangements. If I fix C, and look at C, A, B, D,
that is the same as A, B, D, C. Hence, whatever I am fixing here is irrelevant but these are the
possible distinct permutations. But I am allowing clockwise and anticlockwise are different,
so my A, B, C, D is different from A, B, C, D. These are different. So, I have a A, B, D, C
which is not same as A, B, D, C, the clockwise. So, the mirror images are different. If you
look at it, this is a mirror image of this and this is a mirror image of this. So, they are
different.
So, the number of possible circular permutations of 
 objects if the clockwise and
anticlockwise are different is (
 1)! and the reason behind this is I fix one of the objects,
the other 
 1 objects can be arranged among themselves in 
 1 ways. And this is the
same for any of these objects. So, there are n (
 1)! ways of arranging my circular
permutations. Now, this is when clockwise and anticlockwise are different.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:42)
Now, if they are the same, these two are the same because the clockwise and anticlockwise
are the same, these two are again the same and these two are again the same which gives me
the total number of circular permutations when the clockwise and anticlockwise are same to
be nothing but
. So, this is how we compute the number of permutations when the order
or when the objects are arranged in a circular fashion.
So, now we move forward. So, we had looked so far at linear transformations, when linear
transformations, I mean, so we have looked so far at linear permutations, by linear
permutations I mean that I am arranging n objects in a row, I am also looking at choosing 
objects from these 
 objects and arranging them in a linear fashion or in a row.
First we looked at what would happen when the objects were distinct, where repetitions were
allowed, repetitions are not allowed, we also looked when the objects were not distinct and
then we looked at when I am placing the 
 objects, distinct objects in a circle, here whether
clockwise and anticlockwise are same or different is what is considered.
Very often we would want to actually do some simplifications using the expressions we have
gathered so far or we have described so far. Very often we would be looking at using the
expressions that we have described so far. What are the expressions?
(Refer Slide Time: 20:30)
We looked at nPr. nPr was
So, when we are simplifying our notation we might have to
solve for the 
 or r. Let us look at a few examples where we can apply the formula to obtain
 or 
 given either of them that is, obtain 
 when we are given a expression concerning 
obtain 
 when we are given a expression concerning 
. Let us look at a few examples.
For example, in the example we look at it, I want to find the value of 
 if nP4 is equal to 20 
P2. Now the left hand side I have nP4 is (
4)!. This is from my definition. My right hand side
I have 20 
2)! and what is given to me is these two are equal and I have to solve for 
Now, if you are cross multiplying it, I can see that I can cancel off 
! here and this leaves me
with (
 2)! = 20 
 4)!.
Now, again applying what we learned from factorial, I know (
 2)! is (
 2) 
 4)!, again this comes from our discussion from factorials, this is equal to 20 
 4)!. I can again cancel out these two (
 4)! and now I have what I remain is I
have (
 2) 
 3) = 20. Now, this is what I have and I can quickly see that this is I
can simplify this to get a quadratic which is 
 14 which is equal to 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:11)
Now, if I solve this quadratic equation, I can so I have the following thing if I solve this
quadratic equation, I get that n so I have 
 14 = 0, n square which I can write
 + 2 
 7 = 0 factoring which gives me a 
 2 or 
 = 7 and taking a
negative value has to be cancelled out which leaves me with only the choice of 
 = 7. So, the
solution to this problem is 
 = 7 because I am eliminating 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:09)
Now, let us look at another example. I have 
, = 3. Again I solve for 
. Now, again my
left hand side nP4, the numerator is
The denominator is
, I can simplify this to
write it as(
4)! 
5)!.Now, I know 
! is 
 1)! , this is what we know.
Similarly, (
 5)!, (
 4)! is (
 4) 
 5)!. I retain (
 1)!. Again, I can cancel
out (
 1)! and (
 4)! and this leaves me with the following, this leaves me with in the
numerator 
, the denominator (
 4) equal to 3. Cross multiplying I get, 3
 = 5
which further simplifies to 2
 = 20 and I can solve for 
 = 10.
So, you can see that I just solved from the first principles that 
 = 10 by expanding or
applying whatever is the formula we have derived. Now, this kind of simplifying expressions
would be very useful again when we get into probability and counting when we are doing the
probability module. So, in the earlier case we solved for 
 given a particular expression.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:42)
The next thing which we are interested in doing is how do we solve for 
? So, in the earlier
case I was solving for 
 was my unknown. Now, for example, I am given 5Pr = 2 
 6Pr-1.
Now, let us look at the left hand side. It is 5Pr again applying the formula 5Pr is
this is
what I have if I apply the formula. Let us look at the right hand side.
In the right hand side I have 6Pr-1. Again this is(6
1))!. We look at the denominator I can
further simplify this denominator as (6 
 + 1)!. So, I have this as
So, what is given
to us is I (5
)! = 2 
)! this that is what is given to us.
Further notice that (7 
)! can be re expressed as (7 
)(7 
)(7 
)! This is
what we have already seen which is as (7 
)(6 
)(5 
)! . So, I can re express as
)! in this way. Now, once we do that, this expression which I have labelled as 1 can
be re expressed as 1 can be re expressed as the following.
How can I re express 1? I can write it as 5!, but (5 
)! is 2 
)! . Now, I can
also write 6! as 6 
 5!, this is something which we have already seen. So, again we go back
and we can see that I can cancel out 5! from that expression, (5 
)! also from the
expressions which gives us the following.
(Refer Slide Time: 29:43)
That when I cancel out both of them, it gives me this following. It gives me the expression
that because I am cancelling out (5 
)! and I can write 5, 6. I have 7 
 so what I have
earlier was I had 5! so earlier what I had earlier was (5
)! = 2 
)!, I cancel out
5 factorial and (5 
)!i, and what I get is (7 
)(6 
) is 2 
 6 which is 12.
I further I simplify this I get it as an 
 2 , this is an 
 2 , I get the I can write this as 
 12 which is 
 + 30 = 0 which I can see as (
 3)(
 10) = 0. I can factor
this as (
 3)(
 10) = 0 which gives me 
 is either 3 or 10. So, this is how we can solve
for 
. Whenever you know what is an expression but you have an unknown you can simplify
the and solve for either 
 or 
 by applying the formula.
(Refer Slide Time: 31:38)
So, when we look at the permutations what a summary of what we have seen in the
permutation segment, first we started with 
 objects, these 
 objects were considered to be
distinct. We looked at how many ways we can choose 
 objects from these 
 objects. When
repetitions are not allowed we saw it was nPr which was (
)!. When repetitions are allowed,
we saw it was 
When objects are not distinct that is I had 
1 of one kind, 
2 of another kind and 
 of a 
kind, it was 
. Now, when we looked at circular permutation when anticlockwise and
clockwise were different, we saw there are (
 1)! ways to arrange these objects. When
clockwise and anticlockwise were the same, it was
. And finally, we saw how you can
solve for 
 and 
 using the permutation formula when we are given an expression and we are
asked to solve for r and n.
So, in permutation we actually looked that how do you arrange n objects or 
 objects out of 
objects arrangement. A order was important. AB was different from BA. But many a time we
might be just interested in how can we choose 2 objects out of 3 objects or how can we
choose 3 people from a group of 10 people. In situations like this the order is not important.
AB is same as BA. For example, I have 3 people and I just have to choose 2 people from 3
people, the order is insignificant.
Hence, we are going to look at what is called combinations, the number of ways you can
choose 2 people or you can select 2 people or you can select 
 people in general from 
people gives us to what we referred to as combinations. That would be the next topic we are
going to discuss.
