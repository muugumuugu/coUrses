In this question, we are supposed to choose the correct options from these 4. So let us look at the
first option. In the first option, a coin is to be tossed 7 times, the number of outcomes in which
utmost 3 heads appear. So we need a maximum of 3 heads. So that gives us 4 cases which is 0
heads, 1 head, 2 heads, and 3 heads.
So 0 cases of the 7, we choose no toss at all. So that will become 7C0 which is equal to 1. And for
1 head, we choose 1 toss of the 7 which is 7. And for 2 heads, we choose 2 tosses of the 7 which
is 21. And finally, 3 heads is 3 choices from 7 which is 35. So all of these put together gives us
64 outcomes. So this is 64 and this is correct.

Now, for the second part, if a fair die is rolled thrice, the number of outcomes in which the sum
of the three results is odd. So the sum of the results should be odd and that we are looking for the
number of outcomes.
So the sum of the three results should be odd which means, let us call these results r1 + r2 + r3,
and this is odd. And this can only happen if all three of them are odd or two are even and one is
odd. These are the only two cases which is, all are odd or two are even and one is odd.
So why are these only two cases? Suppose we consider the other cases where all or even. If all
are even, you are going to get the sum as even, and if there is only one even and two odd, the
sum of two odds will be even; so even plus even will give you even. So these are the only cases
we have and now, let us look at them.
All are odd. So in the first result, we have 3 options; in the second result, we have 3 options. And
in the third result, we have 3 options. Because you have 1 3 5, 1 3 5, 1 3 5 in all of these.
Whereas, in the next case, again you will have, first result will have 3 options; second result will
have 3 options, and third result will have 3 options.
So these options are 3 3 3 because there are also 3 even numbers. So let us assume that r1 is odd,
then r1 has the option of being 1 3 5, but r2 and r3 will then have the options of being 2 or 4 or 6.
And now, there is a further concern of which one is the odd result. So that can be chosen in 3C1
ways which is basically r1 is odd or r2 is odd or r3 is odd.

Now, if we count the total number, will have 3 
 3 = 27 for all are odd. Whereas, in the
other case, will have 3 
3C1=81. The sum is then 27 + 81 = 108.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:29)
But here, they are saying it is 36 which is not true. So this is not true. Going further. The number
of ways of selecting at least one Indian and one, at least one American for a debate from a group
comprising of 3 Indians and 4 Americans is 105. So we have at least one Indian and at least one
American.
Now, the problem does not say how many people need to be selected. So presumably, you can
choose any number.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:13)
So if you can choose any number, there are 3 Indians and 4 Americans. So there are 7 in all. So if
you can choose any number, what you are getting is 7C1 plus 7C2 plus 7C3, so on till 7C7. This is if
there are no restrictions. And this is equal to 27
1, that is, 127.
Of these, we should remove the cases where there are no Indians or no Americans. So the cases
where there are no Americans let us take, for example. Then you can pick 1 Indian or 2 Indians
or 3 Indians. So that will be 3C1 plus 3C2 plus 3C3 which again is equal to 23
And similarly, if we choose 1 American or 2 Americans or 3 Americans or 4 Americans without
any Indians, you will get 4C1 plus 4C2 plus 4C3 plus 4C4 which is equal to 24
1. This is 7 and this
is 15. So of the total possibilities, we are subtracting 7 plus 15 which gives us 127 minus 22
which is equal to 105.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:07)
So this is a number of ways to pick a debate team in which there is at least one Indian or one
American and 105 is correct. So C is also correct. Now, let us look at the last option which is, 2
adults and 3 children can sit around a circular table in twelve ways such that the adults are
always sitting together.
So then, we have a circular permutation here, there are 2 adults. Now, these 2 adults are treated
as one entity, and then they have C1, C2, and C3 who can sit around them, the three children. So
technically, these are 4 entities totally and in a circular permutation for n entities, you will get n
minus 1 factorial, that is, 3 factorial ways in this case.
But the A1 and A2, the adult 1 and adult 2 can be interchanged in each of these permutations so
you get additionally 2. That gives us 6 into 2, 12 ways. So there is these 12 ways, which means D
option is also correct.
