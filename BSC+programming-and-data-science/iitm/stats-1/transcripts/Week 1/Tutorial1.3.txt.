We have formatted the sheet in the previous video, now I have removed that data. We
will look at better ways to fill in those cells. Earlier, we did it by our own calculation.
But this time around, let us make the spreadsheet software do the calculations for us.
So, the initial entry here we will have to do in the month of March, there is no interest
the total interest will be 0 and the principal amount which is the 10,000 rupees is what is
owed up to that month and as you can see, after the formatting the rupee symbol gets
added by itself.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:08)
Now, for the next one, we should input the an interest for the month of April. We know
that the principal is 10000 rupees and the rate of interest per month is 0.5 percent.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:26)
If we did the calculation, we will get it to be 50 rupees, but let us make the spreadsheet
software do the calculation. And for that, for making the spreadsheet software evaluate
things, we go to the cell and we press 
is equal to
 symbol. This tells the spreadsheet
software that whatever is there in the cell, the formula that you enter needs to be
calculated.
So, this would be equal to the principal amount which is 10000 * 0.5%, 0.5% is 0.5
divided by 100. You can see that, whatever you are entering in the cell is also in this bar
which is where the cell function is being evaluated and it is already showing us that the
quantity will be 50 rupees. So, once I have entered this, I press enter and we have 50
rupees.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:20)
(Refer Slide Time: 02:25)
Also pay attention to the multiplication symbol being the asterisk. The asterisk is the
symbol above the 8 key. You can press shift and 8 and you will get the asterisk symbol; I
am going to delete the extra one here. So, now we have done this, enter and we have 50.
As before, we are going to use auto fill to fill these cells and now they are all 50 rupees
as we know the interest for each month is a fixed amount and that is 50 rupees.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:04)
But we can do something more interesting when we go to the total interest to be paid up
to this month. The total interest to be paid up to this month as you can realize is the
interest for that month plus the total interest of the previous month. So, that would be the
cell B3 + the cell C2.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:23)
(Refer Slide Time: 03:36)
And this we can do by using again the 
is equal to
 symbol and we directly refer to the
cell B3 as you can see the highlighted cell is B3, when I type in B3, the spreadsheet
software highlights it plus C2 and that is also highlighted. And now I will press enter and
I get the 50 rupees which is 50 plus 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:10)
Similarly, the total money owed up to this month would be the principal plus the total
interest to be paid up to this month. So, I could again use cell reference and I could write
this cell D3 to be equal to D2 + C3 and I get this.
Now, let us see what auto fill does here. I take this 50 and I drag it down like this and we
see that the increments are all correct. 100 is this 50 plus this 50 and 150 is this 50 plus
this 100 likewise, 200 is this 50 plus this 150. All these values have been filled in
correctly. And how is that happening? Let us observe the formulae. This cell we wrote it
as B3 + C2, but now when we go down to the next cell, it has changed to B4 + C3 and
this one it has changed to B5 + C4.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:08)
So, what auto fill is doing is it is correspondingly changing the cells in the formula as we
have gone down vertically as we have drag down vertically, it is only changing the row
numbers, it is not changing the column values B is B, C is C; but as you can see B6 +
C5, now it becomes B7 + C6. Now its becomes B8 + C7 and so on. So, this is giving us
the values we want.
However, if we looked at the D column and we try to do the same thing, let us hold this
and now drag it down. We see that there is a problem here. What I want is actually the
principal plus the interest up to that point which should be say this cell should be 10,150
whereas, this is 10,300.
This cell should be 10,000 + 200, but it is now 10,500. So, what is going wrong is my
formula is being updated to D3 + C4; the next one becomes D4 + C5. The next one
becomes D5 + C6. But what we really want is the D2 to be fixed, the formula should not
change D2; it should only change the C column row number.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:38)
And this can be done by putting a dollar symbol in the formula in front of the 2 and press
enter. This cell does not change, but what the dollar symbol does when we do an auto fill
now is, it keeps the cell fixed. And now, if you look at the formulae for the cells here,
this is D2 + C4 now, this is D2 + C5, this is D2 + C6. In all cases we are getting the
principal plus the corresponding interest up to that month.
Now, let us do something similar with this column. All of these instead of using the
number 10,000; let us use cell reference. So, I will make this is equal to D$2 once again
because I only want the 10,000 amount and not the corresponding cells below. This
value into again the same 0.5 by 100 enter and now again use what auto fill to bring this
down and we see that, every cell is currently D2 * 0.5 / 100.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:11)
And the reason this is useful, the reason cells reference is very useful is this. If I change
my principal amount instead of 10,000 suppose I had made it 20,000; all the
corresponding cells are automatically updated and this is because we are using cell
reference. Every cell here depends on the 20,000, every cell here depends on the 20,000
and this one depends on the B column which is dependent on the 20,000 cell.
So, just this one change can give us an automatic update of all the month
s information.
So, you could give some strange number I mean an uncomfortable number like say
34,578 rupees and all the calculations are done for you.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:46)
Now, let us go back to making this 10,000 for looking at better numbers and this column
which is currently doing the calculation with D2, but with a fixed interest rate that is 0.5
percent. We can make this column also a little better by using formulae, for that what we
will do is, we will give the rate of interest in a particular cell.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:24)
In this cell, I will write down the title which is interest rate per month, enter and I would
like to format it. Once again I will do text wrapping and now I will center align it a bit
horizontal align, vertical align and maybe also give it a nice color, let us use this and
bold. So, this to indicate that it is the next cell, I will also give a small arrow looking
symbol and the interest rate I am going to fill it in the cell which is our 0.5 percent and
once again center align and done.
Now, what we could do is since we know that G2 in fact, I could just use the same
formatting for this cell so, a very nice way to do that is I can use this cell, copy which is
control C and then go here and paste control V and now change the content. So, I have
managed to paste the format change the content to 0.5% and if we go back to our column
here, the B column; we are going to refer to the cell G1 in order to calculate this value.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:07)
So, instead of D2*0.5/100, I am just going to write it as D2 * G$1. In fact, if I want to
specifically mention just that cell, I could also put a dollar in front of the column title
which is G. So, I have D2 into dollar G dollar 1 enter. And now if I did the auto fill here,
every cell is the same quantity which is the principal into the rate of interest.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:49)
I could go further and I can do the same thing with the principal. So, I am going to also
enter the principal here and this principle, we are currently calling it 10,000 rupees, I
could copy paste again, control C and control V.
And now if I wanted the same formatting as this, control C, I select these two cells and
there is something called paste special which is we can go into the edit and in paste,
control V was paste; but control alt V which is a special kind of paste, it paste only the
format without the cell value. So, I just do this and now I have them all in the same
format. Of course, this one can again be made number - Indian rupee.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:46)
Now, the convenience of all of this is, if I correspondingly changed all the mentions of a
principal to that particular cell which is equal to $G$2. And this one also instead of D2, I
will just refer to the cell with the principle which is $G$2. And thus, bring it all down
and here also, I do not want it to refer to D2 any longer, I just want to G2 and again drag
it all the way down.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:53)
Now, the convenience that we have with this kind of a setup is, you could automatically
update the whole sheet simply by playing with these numbers. You want to change this
number to 15,000; you get the corresponding values and you want to change the interest
rate, you want to make it 1% instead of 0.5; you getting the corresponding values, you
could change it to 0.3% and the calculation is done.
So, this way you do not really need to input every cell of your spreadsheet. If you
organize your spreadsheet well and you make sure it represents the data properly, you
can also play around with your spreadsheet and update it in very easy ways. And in our
example, the entire simple interest data for so and so number of months is completely
dependent on these two cells G1 and G2. So, in this way organizing your data and
building your spreadsheet in a way you can manipulate all your data conveniently is a
very useful skill to have.
In the next video, we will see about some functions that you can use in your
spreadsheets.
Thank you.
