Introduction and Types of data Part 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:16)
So, when you have come here I assume at this point of time you know what is data, you
know you have a good data set. By meaning you have a tidy data set what I mean is you
have actually a data set which is organized into variables and you have cases. Each case
is recorded for each variable and if I do not have a data, I will not record that data. So,
this is a tidy data set.
Further, from this data set you are able to look at the variables, you are able to broadly
classify these variables as categorical variables and you are able to classify them as
numerical variables. So, at this point of time this is what you should be able to do with
your data set.
Now, what do we want to do next? Now, we again examine each of our variables in
greater detail because if you look at the definition of the statistics which we gave earlier,
it said that you want to learn from data. Now, when I want to learn from data the
immediate thing is I want to see whether I can summarize this data. Again, when I say I
want to summarize this data, the question I ask is can I come up with some graphical
summaries and can I come up with numerical summaries. The minute I say numerical
summaries, I need to know whether I can do arithmetic operations on the data, ok.
So, to know whether I can do arithmetic operations on data, I need to understand what
are the scales of measurement I use for my data. Now, when we look at scales of
measurement, I have 4 scales of measurement and they are called the nominal, ordinal,
interval and ratio scale. We are going to understand about each of these scales of
measurement in great detail.
Why is it important? It is extremely important for us to know what is the scale of
measurement for each of the variables I have in my data set to eventually come up with
what is the kind of summary I can do for that variable. Hence, it is extremely important
for us to know what is the scale of measurement for each variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:01)
We start with the nominal scale. When the data consists of labels or names, the scale of
measurement is considered a nominal scale.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:16)
(Refer Slide Time: 03:19)
Again, let us go back to our example. You can see in the first example I have name
which is evidently a nominal scale because it is only names, ok. Again board you can see
that it is labels in some sense I have a state board I have a ICSE, I have a CBSE, ok.
Whereas gender, again it is a label, I am labelling this category with a female and a male.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:57)
So, you can see that names, board, gender. We go back here, we have the blood data. In
the blood group data you see again I can label it as O positive, A minus, O negative. One
thing we need to notice here is I just have labels, I have only names; there is no particular
order of these names.
For example, the data would not have made any difference that is whether I am having a
female male or a male female. It is absolutely it does I am just having this as a label to
identify the characteristic. So, this is the called a nominal scale of measurement.
Sometimes we can see that nominal variables may be numerically coded. What do I
mean by a numerically coded nominal variable?
For example, we have gender. Gender takes two labels which is male and female. I might
code a male a 0 and a female a 1, I might code a male a 1 and a female is 0. So, this
numerically coded is again equivalent to just labelling this variable, this numeric; no
sanctity about having a 0 or a 1.
I could label a man or 2 and woman a 3, or a woman a 5 and man a 7. All it says is this
label has the same understanding; these numbers have no meaning when you are coding
the nominal variables. Both the codes are valid that is what we mean.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:40)
When no nominal variables are coded whether 1 or 2 or 3 and 1, it has both codes are
valid. There is no ordering. This is extremely important that we understand when I talk
about nominal variables; there is no ordering in the variable. So, a nominal variable is
just name categories without implying order.
Going back to a data sets in the student data set, name, gender, board are nominal
variables. In a blood bank data set, we have gender and blood group which are nominal
variables. In the cricketing data set jersey number is a nominal variable. The role of
batsman is a nominal variable, that is and the player name is a nominal variable. So,
nominal scale of measurement is used when I have name categories without implying
any order.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:55)
The next scale of measurement is called an ordinal scale of measurement where the data
exhibits the same property of nominal data, but here an order or rank is meaningful.
What do I mean by this is for example, a customer who visits a restaurant provides a
service rating of excellent good and poor. The data are again labels.
The data is again labels. For example, I can have a data where I have customer 1 who
gives a rating of excellent, customer 2 good, customer 3 bad, customer 4 again good. So,
if you look at the variable, the variable is rating.
Here you can again see this is taking a nominal value. By nominal it is taking a
categorical value where my categorical variable has 3 categories; excellent, good and
bad, but within this categorical variable there is an order. You know the order is bad,
good and excellent. So, categorical or nominal data which exhibit some rank or an order
or rank is meaningful is said to have the measurement, the scale of measurement is said
to be a ordinal scale.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:42)
So, ordinal scale of data is name categories that can be ordered.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:53)
The next scale is called an interval scale of measurement. Now, when we talk about
ordinal scale, again I can code an ordinal scale of measurement. For example, in our
earlier example my bad could have been coded as 1, my good can be coded as 2, and my
excellent can be coded as 3. I could code them.
There is an order in 1, 2, 3. But then one thing which I need to understand here is the
distance between bad to good need not be the same as the distance between good and
excellent. It is just an order, I know excellent is better than good, but I cannot say that
excellent the difference between good and excellent is the same as the distance between
good and bad. I have an order, but at this point of time I am not able to comment
anything more about this order.
So, when I go to interval scale of data, interval scale of data has all the properties of
interval scale of data, but the interval between the values is expresses a fixed unit of
measure. Remember, when I said bad, good and excellent, I said the difference between
good and bad need not be the same as the difference between excellent and good.
Whereas, when I have internal data I have an ordering, but in this case whenever I am
ordering my data the interval between the values is expressed in units of a fixed unit of
measure. When the differences expressed in a fixed unit of measure; so, if I have for
example, it can I can find out the difference between any two values, ok.
Now, here ratios do not have any meaning because the value of 0 is arbitrary. Let us
explain this through an example. Interval data and numerical values that can be added or
subtracted, it has no absolute 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:05)
Let us look at temperature as an example. Suppose, the reference or response to a
question is how hot the day is, and you respond as just comfortable uncomfortable or just
good, bad. I am just giving a label to my feeling. I really I am not grading or ordering
this feeling I have, whether I am just telling it is comfortable it is categorized into
comfortable and uncomfortable or it could be just leisurely or the something. But in a
sense you might feel that there is an order, but at this point of time I am not having any
order between comfortable and uncomfortable. Temperature is a variable of interest and
here you can see temperature is a nominal variable.
Now, suppose temperature is again the variable of interest, but here I am interested in
knowing how hot a liquid is, whether it is cold, warm, or hot; you see that there is a order
in this variable. I know cold has warm is warmer than cold or hot is warmer than warm,
the variable is ordinal. However, here I do not know whether the difference between a
warm and a cold beverage is the same as a hot and a warm beverage.
But now suppose I am measuring the temperature, consider an AC room which is set at
20 degree centigrade and temperature out of their outside the room is 40 degree
centigrade it is correct to say that the difference in the temperature is 20 degree
centigrade, absolutely fine.
Suppose, I had set it at 10 degree, 14 degree centigrade and the temperature outside was
28 degrees, it is perfectly right for me to tell that there is a difference in the temperature
of 14 degree centigrade. But it is incorrect; it is absolutely incorrect for me to say that
outdoors is twice as hot as indoors because 40 degree centigrade is not twice as hot as 20
degree centigrade.
So, when I am talking about an interval scale I know in an interval scale, I know the
difference between 10 degree centigrade and 20 degree centigrade is 10, which is same
as a difference between 20 degree centigrade and 30 degree centigrade, which is same as
a difference between 30 degree centigrade and 40 degree centigrade.
But I cannot make a statement that 40 degree centigrade is twice as hot as 20 degree
centigrade. It is incorrect. So, when I am able to; so, that tells me that I can talk about the
difference between any two values, but here ratios have no meaning.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:13)
Again, we understand from temperature, at least when we talk about Celsius and
Fahrenheit scales there, there is no absolute 0, in the Celsius 0 and 100 are set to be as
the freezing point and the boiling point whereas, in Fahrenheit it is 32 and 212. Only in
the Kelvin you have a 0 degree, where 0 means absolutely no temperature. But when you
are talking about Celsius and Fahrenheit we understand that there is no absolute 0.
So, when you talk about an interval scale, it is extremely important for us to understand
there is no absolute 0. However, the difference between an interval scale and an ordinal
scale of measurement is in an interval scale the difference between the values is fixed
unit of measure whereas, for a ordinal scale that need not be a fixed unit of measure that
is good to bad need not be the same difference as excellent to good. This is the key
difference.
The last scale of measurement is what we refer to as the ratio scale of measurement.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:25)
In a ratio scale of measurement it has all properties of interval data and the ratio is a very
meaningful measure. The scale is a ratio scale. So, the example, height, weight, marks.
Like I know a person who has scored 300 has scored twice as well as a person who has
scored 150 marks.
I know a person with a score of 200 is highest score of 200 is twice as good as a person
who has scored 100 runs. I know a person who has taken 100 wickets is twice as good as
a person who has taken 50 wickets.
So, I can have a notion of a ratio which I can define here, the variables, height, weight,
marks, runs, wickets all of them are examples of ratio scale of measurement. So, ratio
when you have a variable which is measured in the ratio scale; you can do all the
mathematical or arithmetic operations on it.
You can add, you can subtract, you can multiply or divide. Whereas, when you talk
about interval scale you can only talk about difference or you can add and subtract. You
have no absolute 0, so ratios do not have any meaning.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:04)
Whenever you are presented with the data set after you identify the variables as
categorical or numerical, it is extremely important for us to understand that when I have
categorical data, I have the nominal and ordinal scale. Within the nominal scale, I have
nominal which is only named category, ordinal is a name with an order. Here the
difference between order is not a fixed measure.
Again, example for categorical data name, blood group or nominal scale; ordinal scale
ranking, rating; there is a order, but then there need not be a fixed order in the rating.
Absolute 0 does not exist for an interval scale. This is for numerical data or quantitative
data. Absolute 0 does not exist, but proportional difference exists.
I can have the mathematical operation of difference done here. And in the ratio scale,
ratios are possible. All variables of age, height, weight, marks etcetera are variables
which can be measured on a ratio scale. Temperature, grade point, average everything is
a 4 GPA is not twice as good as a 2 GPA, they can be measured on a in interval scale
So, whenever we are given data why are we interested about the scales of measurement?
Here you can see no arithmetic operations possible. Here I can have some sense of an
order. Here I can do addition, subtraction. Here I can do all arithmetic operations. So, the
minute I identify the variable the type of questions, I asked makes sense.
For example, when I have a variable which is a blood group I would not be asking the
question of what is the average blood group because I cannot define any arithmetic
operation here. Similarly I need to, but when I am talking about a age or a mark, I can
ask about some numerical summaries depending on what is this scale of measurement.
So, with this we stop this module. At the end of this module you should be able to look at
a data set which is very well organized, identify variables as categorical or numerical.
And once you are able to identify these variables further look at what are the scales of
measurement whether it is a nominal, whether it is an ordinal scale of measurement or
whether it is an interval scale of measurement or ratio scale of measurement.
Most of the textbooks and books written in statistics clubbed; both of these scales
together and mentioned it either as an interval or ratio scale. But nevertheless there is a
difference, and the critical difference is in an interval there is no absolute 0, whereas in a
ratio scale an absolute or a true 0 exist.
