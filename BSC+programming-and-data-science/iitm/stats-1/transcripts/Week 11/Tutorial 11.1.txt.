Hello Statistics students. In this week tutorial we are going to solve problems related to binomial
distribution. So, you must have seen in our lectures that in binomial distribution, we used to find
the probability of 
 success in 
 trial, where each trial results in 2 outcomes. So, the probability of
getting 
 success in 
 trial is given by
 (1 
 where 
 is the probability of success.
So, suppose you have a problem, how can you identify that problem resembles with the binomial
distribution? So, we will read the question, suppose that 10% of the population is left handed. Find
the probability that in a group of 20 individuals, where each individual is either left handed or right
handed there will be exactly 3 left handers.
So, each individual is left handed or right handed, so you have only 2 outcomes, either the
individual is left handed or right handed. And the probability that he is a left handed, he or she is
a left handed is 10%, that means the value of 
 is 0.10. Now, you have value of 
 here is 20, the
value of 
 so in this question we have been asked, give me the probability that there will be exactly
3 left handers.
So, 
 is 3, so basically what we have to find is probability of getting 3 success in 20 individuals,
that will be 20
3 , probability of success is 0.10
 that is 3, (1 
) that is (1 
 0.10)
 is 20 
This is nothing but
3 (0.10)3 (0.9)17. So, this will be our answer in a group of 20 individual,
what is the probability that there will be exactly 3 left handers. Thank you.
