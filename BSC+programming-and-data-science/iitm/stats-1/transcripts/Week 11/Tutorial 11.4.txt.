The probability that a student who registered for the IITM online degree programme will qualify
the exam is 0.4. Find the probability that out of 10 students no one will qualify the exam. So, here
the probability that this student will qualify the exam is 0.4. Now, what we have to find out that
out of 10 students no one will qualify the exam.
Let us say 
 be the random variable that the student will qualify the exam. So, number of student
that qualify the exam. So, in that scenario 
 can take value 0, 1, 2, 3, till 10 this means no student
will qualify the exam, 1 student will qualify the exam, all student have qualified the exam. So, our
question is no one will qualify the exam. So, is it a particular student that student either will qualify
the exam or not qualify the exam. Assume that there will not be any case that the student is in
between like qualified or not qualified.
So, basically what we have to find out is, here probability that 
 is taking value 0. So, what we
have 
 here? 10, so 10
0 , probability of success that means he or she will qualify the exam is 0.4
that is here itself 0 and probability of that he or she will not qualify the exam here is (
) that
is (10 
 0) which is nothing but
0 is 1 itself 0.40 is 1 into 0.610 that is nothing but 0.610 . So,
this will be our answer that the out of 10 students no one will qualify the exam.
