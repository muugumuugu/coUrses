Discrete Random Variable
(Refer Slide Time: 0:16)
So, in this lecture, we will just have a brief review of what we have done so far. So, we have
already defined what is a random variable, we looked at discrete and continuous random
variables, how these arise naturally in a lot of applications and then afterwards we introduced
what is called a probability mass function that is when we want to know about the distribution of
a random variable, we represent the distribution of a discrete random variable with what we
know or what we call the probability mass function.
We also saw that the probability mass function, the graph of a probability mass function gives us
an idea of the distribution of the random variable. We also introduce the notion of a cumulative
distribution function which also helps us to understand how a random variable is distributed on
in a complete range. So, now we are going to introduce an extremely important concept of a
random variable which is called the expectation of a random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:35)
So, we first go and look at an application of the concepts you have learned so far. Suppose we
are interested in analyzing the number of credit cards owned by people or adult population in a
particular geographical area towards this we collect data on a number of people and the data we
have collected on them is we ask them or what we record is the number of credit cards that they
own.
So, if I am looking at it as a random experiment where I am choosing a random or a person from
this collection of people, my random experiment is to select an adult at random. So, it could be 1,
I am selecting an adult I just note down the person's name, I am selecting another adult, so if I
am selecting 50 adults my sample space is going to be each 1 of the adults whom I have sampled
from this population.
Now, associated with each adult, so I have a sample space for example my sample space could
be Raja, it could be Bharat it, could be Andrew and so forth, all these people whom I am
sampling it could be some then after it could be Maithali, I could just write down all these people
associated with each outcome is the number of credit cards owned by the person. So, Raja could
respond by saying that he owns 4 credit cards, this person could say no, this says 0, this says 1,
so associated with each outcome I am defining the random variable which is the number of credit
cards owned by the person.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:34)
So, I can see that when I am looking at number of credit cards, this number is a discrete random
variable. So, let me denote that by x, so x is the number of credit cards owned by a person. Now,
this takes discrete values because I cannot own 1 and a half credit cards, I can own it in discrete
values and the values I can see that this takes are the following.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:06)
I can own 0, a person has either owns no credit card or 1 credit card or 2 credit cards or 3 credit
cards or 4 credit cards, so that is the value that this random variable x takes which is 0, 1, 2, 3
and 4. Now, this random variable takes these values with a particular probability I can see that it
is 0.42 with that now (
it takes the value (
, I can verify that this is a probability mass function, I add
all of them and I can see that this is 0.50 + 0.50 which I get is equal to 1, hence this is a
probability mass function, further everything is greater or equal to 0. So, hence I have a
probability mass function which is given to me.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:25)
Now, let us plot the probability mass function, the minute I plot this probability mass function,
this gives us the distribution of the random variable, so you can see the graph of the probability
mass function, the probability mass function, the distribution, remember we said the probability
mass function tells us about how this random variable is distributed, we can see that the 0 has a
peak when I say 0 has a peak, this says that I can expect that most of the people do not own any
credit card.
And then afterwards I see that many people own 1 credit card, whereas very few people own 3
and 4 credit cards respectively. So, you can see that this probability, this table that is the
probability mass function gives us an idea of the distribution. So, as an application let us look at
describing the distribution. Again if you look at this distribution, you can see that it is speed at 0
and then followed by 1, then followed by 2, then followed by all the other values.
So, you can see that there is a skew to this distribution. Again recall, I say a distribution is
symmetric if it is of this kind, we have seen a symmetric distribution, it is skewed, it could be
either skewed this way or it could be skewed in this way and we can see that this particular
example exhibits a skewness where I have a peak at the lower most value and it is tapering
down.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:21)
So, I can see that if I am asked to describe the distribution, I can say that it is skewed right with a
peak at 0 and the values of x are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 which I can further articulate by saying that the
number of credit cards owned by people vary between 0 and 4. So, now let us use this
information to answer a few questions, because finally data analysis is about extracting
information from the given data.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:02)
So, how do I use this information? I choose an adult at random, is he or she more likely to have
no credit cards or 2 or more credit cards? Now, how do I answer this question? I know x is the
total number of credit cards. So, to answer this question that likely to have no credit cards, I am
looking at (
Now, what is (
) 2 or more credit cards I am looking at (
) ? We can go back to our distribution and see that the (
this comes from my probability mass function. Now,
) again we go back to our distribution, it is 0.14, this is 0.06 and 0.02, so I can see that
I know 0.42 is strictly greater than 0.22, so I can say
that an adult is more likely to have no credit cards than own 2 or more credit cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:02)
So, that is very clear from the distribution table itself, because the peak is at x = 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:14)
Now, let us look at another question which we are trying to answer from here. The next question
we are trying to answer is you take a random sample of 500 people and you ask them how many
credit cards they own. So, let me rewrite the distribution x takes the value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, the
probabilities are 0.42, 0.36, 0.14, 0.06 and 0.02. So, this adds up to 1, this is my (
), this
is the probability distribution I have.
So, now would you be surprised at the following? What is the first thing everyone owns a credit
card. So, if I take 500 people, my distribution says (
, in other words the way I
can interpret this is in the sample of 500 people that the chance that people have no credit cards
is pretty high.
So, if everyone owns a credit card then it would be unlikely because 42 percent of the adults do
not own credit card according to my distribution. Hence, it is very unlikely that every 1 of the
500 would own credit card. So, this if somebody is claiming that everyone owns a credit card, I
would look at it with suspicion because my distribution says that 42 percent do not own a credit
card.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:06)
The second question is 72 people respond that they have 2 credit cards, so let us go back I can
see that the
I have 500 people, so if the chance of a person having 2 credit
cards is 0.14, among 500 people I can expect 0.14 into 500 which is equal to 70 people from 500
people own 2 credit cards, that is what my probability distribution says.
The statement says that 72 respond so I would not be surprised because 14 percent of 500 is 70,
so it is likely, the first case it was unlikely that everyone would not own a, would own credit
card, whereas here it is very likely that 72 people from a sample of 500 own 2 credit cards.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:26)
So, the next thing which we are going to see is, if I choose a adult at random, how many credit
cards would I expect this person to have. So, if you see I am qualifying this word 
expect
, we
need to understand what we are meaning, what do we expect from this statement.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:53)
So, now we are going to introduce what is an expectation of a random variable. So, at this point
of time you should know what is a random variable, we are looking at a discrete random
variable, a discrete random variable can take finite number of countable values or infinite
number of countable values with their respect to probabilities,
) and so
forth, we have defined the properties of a probability mass function, all the probabilities, the sum
of the probability should add up to 1 and they should be greater or equal to 0, these were the 2
key properties.
And then we talked about the graph of a probability mass function, we introduce the notion of a
cumulative distribution function and we looked at how do we answer questions about the
distribution of a random variable through an example based on credit cards.
