Week 7 Tutorial 1
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
Hello statistics students. In this week's tutorial we will do problems related to conditional
probability. In this problem, we have floppy disks which go through a two-stage inspection
procedure, each disk is checked for defects first manually then electronically. If the disk is
defective, then a manual inspection will spot the defect with probability 0.7. a defective disk
that passes through the manual inspection will be detected electronically with a probability of
0.8. What percentage of defective disks is not detected?
So, there there is a two-stage process, one is manual and the other is electronic and in the first
case so we are saying that the disk is not detected by these two stages, so the probability for
that in the manual is 0.3 and the probability for that in the electronic stage is 0.2. So, now
when we look at the combined probability we have
which is 0.06. So, this 0.3 is 1-
0.7 because 0.7 is the probability of detection and the probability of not being detected is 0.3
likewise this is 1- 0.8.
