Conditional Probability - Independent events: properties
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
So, the question now we want to ask is, now independence means that the conditional probability
of a event E happening conditioned on the occurrence of F is equal to the unconditional probability
of an event happening. Recall this says that E conditioned on the occurrence of F, so the natural
question to ask is what would happen with if E is conditioned on occurrence of F is does not affect
the unconditional probability of E, then what can you say about the probability of this event
happening on the non occurrence of this event F.
Recall F is occurrence of event F, so 
 is non occurrence of event F, F is the occurrence of event
F and
 is the non occurrence of event F, so the question we are asking is if a event is conditioned
on the occurrence of the event F and this is the event E conditioned on the nonoccurrence of event
F. So, the question that is being asked is if E and F are independent can I say that E and 
 are also
independent? That is the question, in other words if the occurrence of E is independent of the
occurrence of F can I say that the occurrence of E is independent of the non occurrence of F also?
So, that is the question that is being asked.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:04)
And the proposition is if E and F are independent then so are E and 
 . So, this requires a very
simple proof. So, we can see that E and F are, let us assume E and F are independent, so if E and
F are independent we have seen that 
) = 
), so that is what we can see.

So, now you can look at this Venn diagram this green area is my(
), I can write the pink area
as (
 ), so that I can write my E as [(
 )]. Notice that (
) and (
are disjoint or mutually exclusive.
Now, once I write E as [(
 )] I can apply my addition law to the disjoint sets to
get 
) = [
) + 
 )]. Now, I apply [(
)], I apply my multiplication rule for
independent events, 
) =

same way.
Now, I take this term to my left hand side, I have 
) = 
 ). Hence, I can
write 
 ) is 
)[1 
)]. We know 1 
) is 
 ) and hence I get 
 ) =
 ) and this tells me that E and 
 are independent. So, we can see that if E and F are
independent so are E and 
(Refer Slide Time: 5:01)
So, this is the proof which we have, we have just discussed, we have 
 ) = 
So, what this entails is the probability of E
s occurrence is unchanged by the information as to
whether F has occurred or F has not occurred. So, 
) or 
 ) whether F has occurred or
F has not occurred if E and F are independent the probability of E
s occurrence is unchanged, that
is what this means.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:46)
So, now we said that independence of 3 or more events is slightly more complicated than just
discussing independence of 2 events. When we talked of independence of 2 events we said that ,
if I have 2 events probability of E and F, if probability of E is, if the probability of the intersection
is equal to the product of probabilities then I can say E and F are independent and the converse is
also true that if E and F are independent then the product; probability of the intersection as the
product of the probabilities, this is what we have for 2 events.
Now, suppose I have, I want to extend this notion of multiplication or intersection of events to
more than 2 events. So, let us, the question that is being asked is suppose E is independent of F,
given that E is independent of F, so I know the 
) = 
) this is what is given to us,
E is also independent of G, so I have 
) = 
), then the question we are asking is,
is E necessarily independent of 
So, I am asking if 
)) = 
), this is the question we are asking. So, let us
look at it. So, this is an intersection E intersection F intersection G, this is the question we are
asking. And we answer this question through a example, we are not going into the detailed
mathematical implication here but we would like to establish the multiplication rule for more than
3 events through an example.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:01)
So, now let us recall this example. I rolled 2 fair dice, you also recall that we defined an event E,
now let me define the event E is sum of 7 in the independent throw, so I am rolling a die twice and
we saw that the sum of 7 probability of E was 1/ 6 this is something which we saw, I had 6 out of
36 which is equal to 1/ 6.
In other terms we saw that getting a sum of 7 is actually independent of whether your first throw
was a 1 or a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or a 5 or a 6, the sum of 7 is independent of what your first throw was,
I can use a similar logic to say that a sum of 7 is independent of what my second throw is also. So,
if I define my events in the following way E is the event that the sum of dice is equal to 7 we know
) is 1/ 6, let me define F to be the event that the first dice equals a 4 again 
) is 1/ 6,
) is again 1 first, first dice is equal to 4 or the first outcome is a 4, again this is a 1/ 6.
This G is the event that the second dice equals a 3, so 
)is 1/ 6, 
) is 1/ 6, 
) is 1/ 6, I
know that E and F are independent because the sum is equal to 7 is independent of what was your
first choice, the sum yet is equal to 7 is similarly independent of what is your second choice, so E
and F are independent. Similarly E and G are also independent. Now, let us look at what is the
event (
So, now if I have defined all these events, the event(
) is the event of getting a 4 in your first
throw and a 3 in the second throw. So, the event (
) G corresponds to the outcome 4 and 3
and I know that the 
)is again 1/36. This is the probability of F intersection G.
Now, the question that is being asked is what is the chance of E happening given the event (
) has happened, I know that, if I know that this event (
) has happened that is the first throw
is a 4 and second throw is a 7 is 3, I know that the chance of me getting a 7 is given (
) has
happened is 1, given 4 and 3 has happened the sum equal to 7 is equal to 1. In other words,
)) = 1. But I also know 
) is 1/ 6. So, we can see that the unconditional probability
of E conditioned on this event F intersection G is not equal to the unconditional probability of E
happening.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:07)
Hence, we can say that event E is not independent of event (
). So, we have that, even though
I have E is independent of F and E is independent of G, we have a condition where E is not
independent of (
(Refer Slide Time: 12:33)
So, this helps us actually come up with the rule for 3 events to be independent, we are only stating
the rule here, explaining and proving it is beyond the scope of this course but I prove, I state the
independence of 3 events rule the following way. 3 events are said to be independent if probability
of the intersection equal to the product of the probabilities, not only that I need to check the
pairwise probabilities 
) is 
) is 
), P(
) is 
). If
these 4 happen then I say the events E, F and G are independent events.
So, for independent events the probability that they all occur equals the probability of their
individual probabilities and these probabilities which are looking at pairwise intersections that
probability of pairwise intersection should be the product of the individual probabilities.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:52)
So, let us look at an application of the multiplication rule for more than 3 events. So, a couple is
planning on having 3 children. Assuming that each child is likely to be of either sex, I am assuming
female and male and the probability of female is equal to the probability of male equal to half that
is what we mean by equally likely to be of either sex and that the sexes of the children are
independent, then find the probability that all the 3 children are girls.
Now, let us define the events, the events are let us define 
 1 to be the event that the first child is a
girl, 
 2 is the event second child is a girl, similarly, 
 3 is the event third child is a girl. Now, the
probability, now the event that all 3 children are girls are is the intersection, the event that all 3
children are girls are the intersection of these 3 events and what we require to find is the probability
of this intersection.
So, applying our multiplication rule I know that probability if they are independent I know this is
equal to 
1)P(
 2)P(
 3). What is 
1)? I know 
1)=1/2, 
2)=1/2, 
3)=1/2 giving me a
probability of 1/8.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:02)
So, I have that the event the probability of all girls are independent is 1/2 into 1/2 into 1/2 which
is equal to 1/8.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:19)
So, what we have seen so far is we introduce the important notion of independent events, we looked
at the independence of E and F and E and 
 namely the occurrence of event E, given occurrence
of event F and namely the independence of event E conditioned on occurrence of F, independence
of event E conditioned on non occurrence of event F and we also extended the notion of
independence to more than 3 events.
