Suppose that A and B are independent events and P(A)=0.8 and P(Bc)=0.4, then find these
particular probabilities. Now what are independent events? Independent events are those
whose probability is not affected by the other event happening, so P(A| B) should be the same
thing as P(A).
Now this is basically P(A B) that is the probability of A occurring with B within the space of
B. So, divided by P(B) this is what happens for independent events alone. Now we know
from P(Bc)=0.4 that P(B)=1 - 0.4 which is equal to 0.6.
So first we have found out that P(B) = 0.6 then P(A B) for independent events would be just
the product of these two and that is 0.8 0.6 which is equal to 0.48. So, this is equal to 0.48
and now the in probability of the union would be the sum of the independent probabilities
minus the sum of the intersection that is P(A) + P(B) 
 P(A B) this is because the
intersection is added twice once in A and once in B so we have to subtract it once, so here we
will get it as 0.8+ 0.6-0.48 = 0.92.
