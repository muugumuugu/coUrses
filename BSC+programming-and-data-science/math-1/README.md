# WEEK 1

## Lec 01 - Natural Numbers and their Operations

>‚Ñï --> {0,1,2,3,....}
>>discrete set

### Operations of ‚Ñï

+ \+
+ \-
+ \*
+ /
+ a|b a is a *divisor* of b --> output *True* / *False*
+ %

### Primes

+ Sieve of Erothenes
+ Unique Factorization Th.

## Lec 02 - Rational Numbers

+ GCD
+ Density of ‚Ñö

## Lec 03 - Real Numbers

### Important Irrationals

+ Polynomial
	+ ‚àö2, ‚àö3 , etc
+ Trancendental
	+ œÄ
	+ e

## Lec 04 - Set Theory

### Properties of a set

+ No duplicates included
+ order irrelavent

>subset --> set formed from selected elements of a superset
>> equivalent to ***binary sequences*** of the length #cardinality-of-superset

### Special Sets

+ œÜ --> Empty Set . Subset of All Sets Vacously.
+ ‚Ñô(X) --> Set Of all Subsets of X.

## Lec 05 - Construction of Sets and Set Operations

>Set Comprehension
>> { *g*(x) | *some condition* on x, where x ‚àà to a *certain* ***predifined*** *set* }}
>>> g              --> *transform*\
>>> some condition --> *filter*\
>>> predifined set --> *generator*

>Intervals

>Operations
>> Unions\
>> Intersections\
>> Set Difference\
>> Complementation relative to a Universal Sets

## Lec 06 - Relations

> A filtered subset of a Cartesion Product b/w sets.
>> Filter equips the subset with a binary operation hat acts on the first element of all tuples to result in the second element.
> Can also be denoted by a node-edge (*bipartite*) graph between the vertices taken from set-1 to set-2.
>> two vertices v<sub>a</sub> v<sub>b</sub>, representing  a ‚àà A & b ‚àà B respectively , are connected iff aRb. that is the relation holds for that pair.

###examples

+ Square in 2D real plane is a relation on ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>X‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>X‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>X‚Ñù<sup>2</sup> , and also on ‚Ñù<sup>8</sup>. The relation is that the tuple defines being a corner.

###equivalence relations
+ partitions the set in question (mutually disjoint partitions, with covering union.)
+ is reflexive , symetric and transitive.

## Lec 07 - Functions

> ùëì : X ‚Üí Y, a subset of a relation where the first element is resticted to no repetations. THis constricted subset is like a Map from set of elements in X to Y.
>>the set of first elements of tuples: Domain on which function acts.
>>the set of second elements of tuples: Range of function.

###Bijections

+ Injective : One-One.
+ Surjective : Onto.

###Tables As Relations.
> Extended relations . Each entry a n-tuple, where elements are mutually related by some condition. the set of such conditions is fixed and ordered and is consistent aross rows
>> If one column is unique it can be used as a key, and if two tables share sucha column, a new table can be created by performing a ***join***, that is extending the relations via the key element, and selecting different columns from the two or more tables.

## Lec 08 - Prime Numbers

+ Euclid's Infinity of Primes.
+ œÄ(x) = # of primes < x
+ Prime Number Th. - œÄ(x)--> x/ln(x) as x-->‚àû

## Lec 09 - Why is a Number Irrational?

>The Real line is continous but some points on the line like ‚àö2, obtained from the pythogorean unit right triangle, cannot be represented as a ratio,
hence the need for irrational.

## Lec 10 - Sets V/S Collections

> ‚Ñï is defined in set theory as
>> 0 --> œÜ\
>>1 --> {0, {0}} ==> {œÜ. {œÜ}}\
>>2 --> {1, {1}} ==> {œÜ, {œÜ} ,{œÜ, {œÜ}}}\
>> j+1 --> {j, {j}}

>>Arithmetic Operations are defined in terms of Set Building operations (Union, Intersection & Cartesion Product)

### Is there a Set of All Sets??? - Russel's Paradox

>generating by set comprehension. we can have a set of all sets that do not contain themselves then, this set contain itself impies that it does not contain itself and hence the paradox.
>> so therefore it is not definitive to form a set of all sets, and unrestricted comprehension will always lead to a paradox.

> In general call any unsuitable collection a ***Class***.

## Lec 11 - Degrees of Infinity

>Enumaration - ***bijection*** with ‚Ñï
>> Enumerable Sets are called Countable. They may be finite or infinite

### ‚Ñù is uncountably infinit

> proof by diagonalization (enumarating sequences of {1,0} and picking the sequence off the diagonal --> negating it and hence finding a sequence that had not been counted

### Continuum Hypothesis

> Is there a set with cardinality between that of ‚Ñï  and ‚Ñù?
>> *Independent of Set Theory Axioms*, the existence of such a set cannot be proved or disproved.
