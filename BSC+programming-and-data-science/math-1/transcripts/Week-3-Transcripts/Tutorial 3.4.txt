For our fourth question, we want the equation of a line which is perpendicular to this line,
and is at this distance from the origin. So, from y 
 5x = 0, we get y = 5 x, so therefore, the
slope m1 is 5. And if our line is perpendicular to it, then our line m2 must be 
 1/ m1 , which
is equal to -1/5. So, we know that our line is some y = 
 + C.
If we kind of simplify it, we are going to get 5 y + x = C, this C is not the same thing as the
previous C, I have just used that as C because it is an arbitrary constant, which is yet to be
determined, otherwise it should have been 5C. Anyway, now we have to find the value of this
C in this equation. For that, we are going to use the next bit of information that is given to us,
which is the distance from the origin.
So, this line has this distance from the origin. So the distance from a point formula is
ax1 + by1 + c
a +b
, where (x1, y1) is the point from which we are measuring the distance for this
line. So, in our case, (x1, y1) is (0, 0) because we are doing from the origin. So in our case,
we get modulus of
a2 + b2
, So, modulus of 
 is just the same thing as 
And root of
a 2 + b 2 , in our case comes out to be
, this is given out to be
25 +1, , that is
26 . So we have
, which would imply 
 = 1 , and that would imply c 
 1. So,
we get two answers.

What are the two answers? One is for c being +1, we have 5 y + x = 1. And in the other case,
we get 5 y + x = 
1. for the other choice. So, how does this happen, what is actually
happening here to try to plot our lines?
(Refer Slide Time: 3:08)
So, we have two lines, which we were looking at, which is 5 y + x = 1 and 5 y + x = 
1 and
from this we get the intercepts to be, the intercept form of this would be
this case, we get
+ = 1. And in
1/ 5 1
+ = 1. So, in one case, we have a y intercept of 1/ 5. So, let us
 1/ 5 
assume this is 1/5, then x intercept is 1 which is 5 times of that, so that so it must be
somewhere here, so this would be (1, 0) and this is (0, 1/5).
And our line is going through these two points, giving us something like this. Let us call this
l1 and where do we get the
distance from the origin, we get it when we measure it
perpendicularly from the origin. Now, let us look at the other equation. So -1/5, so, this
should be exactly below this this way and this is -1, so this would be exactly opposite in this
way at the same distance.
So now we have these two points, so we can also construct this line, which goes this way.
And as you can see, they are both parallel and exactly opposite to that
distance which is again perpendicular distance and it is also at
you get this
. So, we have two lines
which satisfy our requirements, one is 5 y + x = 1, the other is 5 y + x =
