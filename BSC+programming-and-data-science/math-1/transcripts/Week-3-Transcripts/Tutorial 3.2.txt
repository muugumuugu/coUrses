And for our second question, there are 2 lines, and these are the equations, which represent
our lines. And a line l3 is parallel to l1 , and passes through (-5, 0). Now we can find l3 , by
using the point slope form, we already have the point, which is (-5, 0). And we can also find
the slope from l1 slope, we already have l1 . And we can write, so l1 is this,
6 x +12 y 
 72 = 0, which tells us that 12 y = 
6 x + 72.
And that gives us y = 
 + 6 so, the slope here is 
 , because y = mx + c. So, slope is 
Now if we did point slope form on this, we would get
 which indicates
2 y = 
 5 . So therefore, x + 2 y + 5 = 0 is basically our line l3 . And now if we look further,
we have line l 4 which is passing through this point, and it is perpendicular to l 3 .
So, if we took this to be m1 = 
 = m3 because m1 and m3 are the same slope. And let us
consider the slope of l4 to be m4, so we can say m3 
 m4 = 
1 , because they are
perpendicular, that would indicate m4 = 
, which is basically 2. So we now have the
slope of l4 . And it also goes through this point.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:57)
2 = 2, that would indicate y = 2 x 
 5 So this
So again, using point slope form, we have
is our l4 .
(Refer Slide Time: 3:14)
Now, the question is being asked is, what is the cardinality of A, which is a set of all points
common to at least 2 of the mentioned lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:28)
For that, let us try to draw our lines on the graph. 6 x +12 y 
 72 = 0 would give us if x = 0, it
gives us y = 6 which means some point let us call this here is (0,6), it goes through this point.
And if y = 0, you get x = 12 . So that would be some point here. So, our l1 is this line. And
now we know l3 is parallel to this line. So l3 , if we, again did the same thing of putting
y = 0, x becomes 
 5 , which is somewhere here.
So, as you can see, I am doing this on a rough estimate. I am not trying to be accurate, but
even a rough estimate can work out here, because you might not always find graph paper
when you require it. So often developing an intuition for the rough estimates is a good idea to
solve problems. Now, this is one point and when x = 0, y becomes -2.5, which is somewhere
like this. So we have (0, -2.5). As you can probably see from our last rough estimate itself
that these do appear to be parallel, they seem to be in the same direction.
Now, l 2 if we look into it with a similar logic, we can see that l 2 can be reduced to
 = 1. So in our intercept form, we can now tell that if I made this plus, this becomes 
so the x intercept is -5, which is this point, again, and y intercept is 6, so that is this point. So,
l 2 , in fact, passes through these 2 points. So, this is our l 2 . So, this was l1 now, this is l3 and
this is l 2 .
Lastly, let us reduce our l4 into the intercept form, we get 4 x 
 2 y = 5, therefore,
= 1. So, when we look at this then 5/4 is a quantity just a little greater than 1, so
5/ 4 
 5/ 2
it is probably somewhere here and 5/2 is a 2 and a half basically. So, -2.5, so this and this
plus we have something like this happening. So, overall there are four points, which are
common to any pair of these four lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:02)
So, our question, the cardinality of A, where A is a set of all points common to at least 2 of
the mentioned lines. So, that would be 4, there are 4 points of intersection here. Now, if R is a
relation, and it is the set of all points inside the region bounded by these 4 lines. So, here we
are, when we say relation, we are basically saying every point in the set when is taken as a
ordered pair like this (x, y), then x would be from the domain of the relationship and y would
be from the co-domain.
So, this is seen as a relation from the set of x values and to the set of y values. And now, we
are asked to find the range and domain of relation R, which is to basically find when we say
range, all the possible y values and the domain is all the possible x values.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:16)
So, here in this region that we are looking at, the possible y values would be between this
value and this value. So, all possible y values are between -2.5 and 6, whereas the possible x
values are between this point and this point, that is between -5 to some particular quantity,
which is the x coordinate of this point. And that point is the intersection of l1 and l4 . So, let
us try to solve l1 and l4 to find that point of intersection.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:03)
We know that this as l1 , and this is l4 and from l4 , we know that y is basically 2 x 
. If
we substituted this into l1 we would get 6 x +12
2 x 
 5 / 2
 72 = 0. This would give us
6 x + 24 x 
 30 
 72 = 0. That indicates 30 x = 102 which indicates x = 3.4. Correspondingly, y
would then be 2 
 3.4 
 2.5, because 5/2 is 2.5, which gives us 6.8 - 2.5, which is equal to 4.3.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:24)
So this point here is (3.4, 4.3) and we only require the x value. So the x values range from -5
to 3.4.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:42)
However, one important thing we need to look for here now is the region bounded by these 4
lines, but excluding the lines themselves.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:52)
Which means -2.5 and 6 themselves do not fall into our domain because we are not interested
in the points on the curve. So this point is on the curve, this point is on the curve, but it is not
inside, similarly, for each of these, because they are the border points. So, -5 is not an x value
inside the domain. Similarly, 3.4 is not a value inside the domain. So, our domain is the
5,3.4
. Likewise, -2.5 is not a y value inside the range and 6 is also not a y value inside the
range, so our range is (-2.5, 6).
(Refer Slide Time: 11:50)
Lastly, there is a line l5 represented by this equation given to us find the cardinality of set B,
which has all the points common to l1 and l5 .
(Refer Slide Time: 12:04)
Let us look at l1 and l5 . l5 is given as x + 2 y = 12 . Now, if we applied our intercept form
again, we would get x / 12 + y / 6 = 1. Let us look at that x / 12 indicates x intercept of l 2 ,
y / 6 indicates y intercept of 6. So, we see that l5 is basically the same line as l1 , indeed if
you multiply this whole equation with 6, you will just get the form of l1. Therefore, l1 and l5
are the same lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:54)
Then, the question is asking, find the cardinality of set B, which has all the points common to
the lines l1 and l5 . There are infinite points because they are the same line. So, the
cardinality of set B is infinite.
