Distance of a point from the given line
(Refer Slide Time: 00:16)
So, we have verified the answer now what you can see here is (-1, 2) is a point which is lying on
the line which is perpendicular to the given line. An interesting question can be asked that what
is the distance of this; point from the given line. Let us try to answer that question in the next
slide.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:40)
So, the question is given any point I have another line the point is not collinear to the line then
what is the distance of that point from a line. So, let us take that as our goal. To be precise we are
interested in finding the distance of the point P which has coordinates ( x1 , y 1 ) of this point from
the line l which has equation Ax+ By +C=0 and this is a general form of equation.
Now how will we proceed? So, if I want to understand the location of P, I need to do some
analysis because Ax+ By +C=0 is a completely geometric object. So, I need to understand this
line in terms of its geometric concepts. So, what are the geometric concepts associated with this
line they are slope x intercept y intercept or points on this particular line. So, let us identify those
things first.
So if we assume that A and B both are not equal to 0 then I can rewrite this equation in the form
of intercept form that is
small b will be
+ =1 so in that case my a is actually
that is x intercept and my
which is y intercept. So, I have identified this line as I have identified the 2
points and these 2 points uniquely determine the line. So, I know how the line is located.
Let us try to visualize this line in terms of the graph of a function. So, as you can see I have
mentioned that x intercept is
, 0 , y intercept is
so it is mentioned as a point Q which is
which is identified here so 0 ,
 , the point P is located here it may be located anywhere
but right now the point P is located here it has coordinates ( x1 , y 1 ). So, now I want to identify a
distance of this point from this line, the line joining the points Q and R.
So, what is the distance? It should be the shortest distance from the line, so the shortest distance
in this case if you move along this line the shortest distance in this case is a point where the point
is actually perpendicular to the line. So, what I want to say is the shortest distance is the one
which is the perpendicular distance. So, the entire question reduces to how to find this
perpendicular distance PM.
So, let us try to see what are the geometric objects associated with this. So, you can see from the
dotted lines the geometric object that I can associate with this particular distance is a triangle
PQR. Now if I want to find the distance PM, I can take help of this triangle PQR so that I will be
able to find the distance PM. So, how will I do that? First you see if I want to compute the area
of triangle PQR what do I need to know?
I need to know the base and the height and the area of a triangle is half base into height. So, half
base into height means
 PM . I do not know what is PM. But we have already seen in
this course how to find area of a triangle where its coordinates are given. So, even though I do
not know what is PM I know how to compute the area of a triangle. The next question is do I
know how to compute the length QR?
Yes of course because this is x intercept this is y intercept and these are the lines which are the
distances on x and y axis and all of them form a right-angled triangle. So, by Pythagorean
theorem I will be able to find the length of QR. So, I can reformulate the question as
PM =2
A ( 
 PQR ) . So, now I know how to compute the length PM if I know how to compute
area of triangle and how to compute the length of line segment QR both of which I know.
So, let us go ahead and try to compute area of triangle PQR. So, here is our formula for area of
triangle PQR which has coordinates ( x1 , y 1 ) , ( x2 , y2 ) ,
( x 3 , y 3 ). So, let us start with ( x1 , y 1 ), the
( x1 , y 1 ) is the first coordinate remember you will always take this in anti-clockwise direction. So,
I will start with this coordinate then I will go to R and then I will go to Q. So, this is ( x1 , y 1 ) this
is ( x2 , y 2 ) and this is ( x3 , y 3 ) according to the notation that is given in the formula.
So you will see x1 ( y 2 
 y3 ) so x 1 is first coordinate it will remain x 1 because P has coordinate
( x1 , y 1 ), y 2 is
0 then the next term that is x2 , x2 here is
, y 3 is zero. So, you will get x1
0 so this entire thing vanishes then you go to x 3 , what is x3 ? x3 is
, into y 1, which is y 1 as it
CB ) so ( y + CB ), this is how I got the formula.
So, if you look at this formula closely you can actually take C common from all within the mod
sign so you can take
|CB |, denominator has terms containing B and AB. So, if you want to take
those terms out you multiply throughout by AB or you find the LCM is AB and you take AB out
so you will get
1 |C|
|A x1 + B y 1 +C|, remember this is the term corresponding to general
2 |B|
form of the equation.
Now we have seen how to compute area of triangle PQR. Next, we will see how to compute the
length QR. But length QR is actually very easy because I have a point Q which has only xcoordinate and I have a point R which has only y-coordinate. So, it will be as if computing the
distance of length QR is
C C these are the 2 sides of the triangle and this QR is the
2+ 2
hypotenuse of that right-angle triangle.
So, again you can simplify this to amend to this form so you can take out C common so you will
get |C|, you take A and B common you will get |AB| and then you will get
 A 2 +B2 which is
which is in the numerator and now if you look at this form PM which is the length of the line
segment PM is 2
A ( 
 PQR )
, so just now it is just a matter of feeding the values this half will
get cancelled with this 2 and area of triangle PQR is this and QR is this therefore this constants
also will vanish because they are same.
And you will get the formula to be equal to
|A x 1 +B y 1 +C|
 A 2 +B2
this is how you will calculate a
perpendicular distance of a point from a line. Now this idea can be helpful in finding one more
thing that is a distance between two parallel lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:22)
So, the question can be asked is I have two parallel lines what is the distance between two
parallel lines. So, let us take the set up because the lines are parallel l1 and l2 they have common
slope or the same slope, so their slope is m. Then you can use the slope point form which is
y=mx +c 1. Now I want to use the previous concept that I have introduced distance of a point
from a line. So, I will first identify this with x intercept. So, what will be the x intercept in this
case?
If you identify this line it is very easy to see go back to the general form and figure out that xintercept is
, because B=1 here B=
m and C=
c1 , so the intercept is this
. Let us take
another line that is l2 it has same slope identify it with our standard form
m, B=1 ,
 c2. So, now given x-intercept what are the coordinates of this x-intercept
c1 .
, 0)
So now the problem reduces to finding the distance of this point from this line ok. So, by using
the distance of a point from a line formula where the point is (
, 0), you just need to substitute
this point ( x1 , y 1 ) into this formula for the distance of a line which is given as
So, my point x1 is
equal to
|C1 
 A +B
|A x 1 +B y 1 +C|
 A 2 +B2
substituted here, y 1 is 0 substituted here you will get the formula to be
so in this case 
 A 2 +B2, B was 1, A is -m so it is 
 1+m 2.
Now you can actually identify this formula in the general equation form also. So, in the general
form instead of B = 1 we have slope which is equal to -A/B and c 1=
and c 2=
. So, this
I am matching with both equations in general form these are slope point forms but now if you
match these equations with a general form you will get this description of the line where you
have Ax+ By +C 1 as one line is equal to 0 as one equation of line.
Ax+ By +C 2 =0 as equation of the second line. So, in that case this is the form and therefore now
you just substitute these values into this expression. So, this m will be replaced by - A/B so you
will get
 A 2 +B2
here and some |AB| will come out common and therefore finally that will
cancel off with this B and you will get the expression of the form
|C1 
 A2 + B2
,C 1 
C 2 belong to
general form of equation.
So, this gives us a clear-cut understanding of the interconnection between the slope point form
and general form of equation and we have figured out what is a distance between two parallel
lines using distance of a point from a line formula.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:42)
So, now we will solve some examples to concretize the concepts so here are the examples in line.
So, you have been asked to find a distance of a point (3,
5) from the line 3 x
26=0. So,
in this case you just need to apply the formula, what is a formula,
|A x 1 +B y 1 +C|
 A 2 +B2
. So, what is A,
B, and C here is the key question? ( x1 , y 1 ) is known to be (3,
5). So, A is 3, B is -4, C is -26
then you just need to apply that formula which will give the denominator square root of 25 it will
give me 5 the numerator will be 3.
In a similar manner you can ask a question what is the distance between two parallel lines
4 y+7=0, 3 x
4 y+5=0. So, what is a formula that we have derived it is
|C1 
 A2 + B2
it is
very straightforward. So, what is C 1 here? C 1 the first line the constant term is 7 the second line
the constant term is 5. So, it will be modulus of
 3 + (
. So, you will get the answer to be 2 /
