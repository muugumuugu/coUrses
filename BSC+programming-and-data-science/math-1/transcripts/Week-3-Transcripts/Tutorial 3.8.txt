In our eighth question, we want the equation of a line which is parallel to this given line. So,
let us first plot the line that is given, lets plot this line. If you look at that line, it is
, which gives us
. So, the x intercept and y intercepts can be marked out as
1.6s. So, if we take this to be 1 and this to be 2, so this is - 1 roughly and this is - 2, roughly.
Yeah, this might be our intercept, which is
, 0) and our y intercept, again, if we take this to
be 1 and this to be 2, 1.25 is somewhere likely here.
So, this is probably our y intercept, (0, . As you can see, we are doing a thoroughly rough
plotting, we do not always have to be very accurate with our plotting. This is only for an
indication. So, this would be our line,
to us, which is
and now we have another line given
Clearly, these two lines are parallel to each other because they have the same slope and that
slope would be, we write it as y is equal to, we will get 3x / 4, so the slope is
and it is
passing through the origin, because if I put x = 0 and y = 0, the line equation is satisfied, that
is there is no constant term. So, this line is our
and we are trying to find a line
that is parallel to these 2 and it is at a distance of 1 unit from the
Let us name these lines as well. Let us call this
and this is
line.
. I am going to erase the
intercepts to make it look a little clear and now, we can find our equation and for that, we will
use the formula of separation between 2 parallel lines. So, that two parallel lines and we write
them with the same coefficients.
and the other one would be
. This is how two
parallel lines would look like. You can reduce them to have the same coefficients for x and y,
like in this case so this is 3 and this is - 4, this is also 3 and this is also - 4. In this case, the
separation between these two parallel lines would be
the modulus divided by
. So, the equation we are looking for, the line we are looking for also is going to
be some 3x - 4y + c = 0.
So, its separation from our l1 is going to be applying the formula modulus of 
is 25. Therefore, you have modulus of
, which is what is expected to be 1 unit. That gives
us modulus of c - 5 = 5.
Now the model is, indicates that there are two possible values here, one could be c - 5 if
,. Because then c - 5 would be positive, and the other would be 5 - c if c < 5. So, what
we get is two separate solutions, one is c - 5 = 5 or 5 - c = 5, in which case we get c is 10 or 0.
So, we have 2 lines, one is
, the other is our
, this is our line.
So now, because of this, we can say that this length between, the separation between these
two lines is now one unit and therefore, the other line, which is our 3x - 4y + 10 = 0 is going
to come on the other side of
, which is going to look like this. So, this line is our
will have intercepts equal to, this should be 0,
which is 2.5 and this would be (-
and it
,0), this is
our other plan.
And now, we should also find out what the value of a is, because a would be the distance
between the lines
that is what they are saying, its units away from our
and we
know that this is one unit and this is also one unit. So, this total length is going to be 2 units.
So, a = 2.
