Hello, everyone, today we will discuss a small topic related to the forms of parabola. In other
words we are going to see the relation between the standard form of a parabola and the vertex form
of the parabola, we already know the standard form of a parabola which is given by 
 2 +
 where these 
 belong to real and 
 0. From this standard form we will try to derive
the vertex form of a parabola.
Now, from this equation we know that the coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is vertex will
 coordinate will be
and 
 coordinate will be 
, this we already see in the previous
lecture. Now, let us denote this coordinate of the vertex as (
). So, our 
 will be nothing but 2
and 
 will be 
 .We have obtained the required data, now let us start the deriving.
We have 
 2 + 
, I will take a common from these two terms, I will get 
 2 + 
 , also I will add and subtract 4
2 to this term, I will get 
 2 + 
 + 4
2 )+c.
Now, also I will multiply with 2 and divide by 2 here, now I will rewrite this 
 2 + 2 
2 )+c. So, if we observe this 
 2 + 2 
 + (2
)2 , this is in the form of 
2 + 2
 2 , we can write this as (
)2 .
So, writing like that, we get (
 + 2
)2 + 
. Now, if I multiply 
 we get 
 + 2
]+c, a and this cancelled, finally I will obtain this will be equal to 
 + 2
) + 
If we observe 
 is 
 here and 2
 will be 
, so if we substituted 
 and 
 in this equation we
get 
)2 + 
 , this is the vertex form, vertex form of the form of a parabola, where this
) is the coordinate of the vertex of the given parabola, this is the standard form and from this
standard form we derived the vertex form.

So, we have got the vertex form of the parabola which will be like this 
)2 + 
 where (
is the vertex of the parabola. Now, let us see one example to understand this vertex form clearly.
So, suppose we have an equation of a parabola given like this 
 = 3
 2 + 6
 + 9 now we try to
write in vertex form, so I will take 3 common from the first two terms, I will get 
 2 + 2
 + 9, so
in order to make this a perfect square I will add 1 and subtract 1.
So, 3(
 2 + 2
 + 1 
 1) + 9, so 3 times this can be written as 3((
 + 1)2 
 1) + 9 , which gives
us (3(
1))2 + 6). So, we have got the equation 
 = (3(
1))2 + 6). So, if we equate
it with this vertex form we get 
1 and 
 = 6. So, our vertex will be at point (
1 , 6) is the
vertex of the given parabola.
So, we will just cross verify it, we know that if we have a standard form we can calculate the x
coordinate of the vertex, so x coordinate of this vertex will be 
, so here 
 is 6 and 
 is 3, so
if I substitute that
 3 which I will get 
1 and we know the y coordinate as 
here we have c is 9 
 is 6 so 
 2 is 36 / 4
 is 3 so 4 9
s 9 3
s, so I will get 6. So, my vertex point
will be at (
 1 , 6), if we solve y, solve through standard form also.

Now, let us see one more example, find the equation of a parabola such that it passes through the
origin and the vertex of the parabola is at (1 , 2). So, as we know the vertex form given by y is
equal to a times x minus h whole square plus k, here we have given that (
) is nothing but (1 ,
So, if we substitute that our equation will be simplified to 
 1)2 + 2, also it is given that this
equation passes through the origin that means 0 , 0 should satisfy this equation. So, if we substitute
it we get the value of a, so 0 = 
 1)2 + 2, this implies 0 = 
1)2 + 2, which implies again
So, our final equation of the parabola will be equal to 
 1)2 + 2, if you open that 
 2 + 4
 2 + 2, so this will be get cancelled and 4
 2 , so 
 = 4
 2 is the equation
of the parabola that passes through the origin and the vertex of this parabola will be at (1 , 2).
Thank you.
