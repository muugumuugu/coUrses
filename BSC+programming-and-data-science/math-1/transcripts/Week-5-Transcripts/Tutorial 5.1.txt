Hello Mathematics students, in this week
s tutorial we will look at question related to quadratic
functions. In our first question here we have two quadratic functions given to us and they intersect
each other at two points and what will be there 
 coordinates. Clearly if they intersecting each
other that means the x and y will be same. So, that is mean 
1 = 
2 and this is what we are trying
to solve for.
So, 
 2 + 
 should be equal to 
 2 + 
 and the 
 is supposed to be same. So,
anyway we can cancel off the c here. So this gives us (
 2 + (
 = 0. This would
imply this is us 
1 + (
2 )] = 0. So, this corresponds to two different solutions.
So, if we took this part to be 0 then 
 = 0 as one solution.
And the next will give us 
2 ). So, this is a product of two terms and that product of two
terms is 0 which means either of two terms has to be 0. So, one solution is x being 0 and the other
one you get this as the solution. Now this is only a valid solution if 
1 and 
2 are not equal because
a denominator cannot be 0. Therefore, 
2 is a condition that needs to be satisfied.
So, these are the two 
 coordinates one is 0 and the other is
