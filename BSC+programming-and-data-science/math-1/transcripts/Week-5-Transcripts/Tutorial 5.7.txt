In this question there are these two curves 
1 and 
2 which are both quadratic curves and there
is this line l which is passing through these two intersection point. So, line l is passing through
the intersection points of these two parabolas. They are asking find 
 and 
 , the curves of the
functions 
 and 
 which are reflections of 
1 and 
2 respectively around l which means for
1 the reflection would be something like this, about l it would be something like this and for
2 the reflection would be something like this and these are what we are trying to find out, 
and 
So, this should be 
 and this would be 
 . For all of these, we have to first find the line l and
that we can find when we solve for the equality of these two functions. So, we are taking 
 2 + 12
. And that gives us 3
 = 0 and that further gives us 
 18) =
0 that indicates 
 = 0 or 
 = 6.
So, this point has coordinate 
 = 0 and this point has coordinate 
 = 6. We need to find the
y coordinates for these points now. For that we substitute 
 = 0 and we get in this equation or
this equation I wrote this and we get 
 = 0. So, this point is essentially the origin. Whereas,
for this point we substitute 
 = 6 and we get 36 
 36 which is 0. So, this point would then
be (6, 0).
So, essentially this is a horizontal line which is 
 = 0, 
 is 
 = 0. So, now we are just looking
for reflections about the 
 axis because 
 = 0 as the 
 axis. And that would give us directly
the negative coefficients of the same things. So, 
 would then be 2
 whereas, 
would now be 
 2 + 6
. Thank you.
