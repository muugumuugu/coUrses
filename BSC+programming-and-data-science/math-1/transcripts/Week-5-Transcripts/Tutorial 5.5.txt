In this question we have 2 sets capital M and capital N which are sets of all values of small m
and small n respectively such that these two equations have always two distinct real roots each,
then find the sets M and N. Let us finish this part first. So, for a quadratic equation 
 2 + 
 = 0 to have distinct real roots, the discriminant which is basically the value 
 > 0.
So, for this first equation that would be 
 16 > 0 and simultaneously, we need for the
second equation 
 4 > 0. So, 
2 > 16 and 
2 > 4 and this would imply m is positive and
greater than 4 or m is negative and lesser than 
4. And here this would imply similarly n is
positive and greater than 2 or n is negative and lesser than 
2. So, these are all the possible
values for which you will have two real distinct roots for these equations.

So, your set M would be the union of two intervals, one is a (
 (4, 
). And set N is
similarly (
 (2, 
). Now the next part of the question, C is a set of integers and
values of m and n are to be chosen randomly from C, then define the set C such that both
equations have two distinct real roots each.
So, this is necessarily one single set we are taking and m and n should be chosen from that set.
So, we clearly cannot have m being 
2 or 2 or even 
3 or 3. The set we are looking for is
some sort of an intersection of capital M and capital N because both small m and small n should
be drawn from this. And in this case that intersection will just be the set capital M because M
is necessarily a subset of N.
However, C is also given out to be a set of integers, so it is not just the intersection of m and n,
it is the set of integers which belong to the intersection and this case that intersection is only
capital M where therefore, we have this set coming up as C.
