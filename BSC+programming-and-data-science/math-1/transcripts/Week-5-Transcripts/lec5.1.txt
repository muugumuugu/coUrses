Solution of Quadratic Equation Using Factorization
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
So, in the last video, we have seen how to find the roots of a Quadratic Equation by
graphing the associated quadratic function.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:37)
In this video, we will see how to find the solution of a quadratic equation by a well
known method called factoring method. For that, we will define one new form of a
quadratic function that is intercept form.
What is an intercept form? If
form , where and
which is a quadratic function is written in this
are called binomials ok. Where this p and q are nothing but x
intercepts of the quadratic function.
So, essentially what you have done is, you have seen a graph of a function and you have
located the two intercepts x intercepts of the function. Whenever the expression is
possible in this form you are writing it. So,
, and this form is called the
intercept form.
So, let us try to see one example of intercept form which is let us say you have been
given this intercept form
. And you also know that these 1 and 5 are x
intercepts of the quadratic function, that means, you have been given two values. Can
you find the third value? The answer is yes.
So, at point 1, when , the value is 0; at point 5, the value is 0. Now, using the logic that I
gave you in the previous video, you can actually see that there will be some axis of
symmetry between this 1 and 5, because 1 and 5 both take value 0 right. So, the axis of
symmetry will be nothing but the distance between these two points divided by 2. So,
. I am sorry it will not be a distance, it is just the sum of these two points
divided by 2, average of these two points, that should be the correct terminology. So, it
should be average of two points. So,
Now,
will be the axis of symmetry for this particular function if at all the this are
the roots of the this are the x intercepts of the function right. So, now, I have given you
is the axis of symmetry. So, just substitute the value 3 in this particular graph in
this particular equation, and you will get 3 - 1 = 2, and 3 
 5 = -2, that means,
. So, you got three values. What are those three values? (1,
0), (5, 0), (3, -12).
So, based on this information, you can easily plot the graph which will look like this. As
you can see this is the value -12 here, value -12 is here and 0, 0. So, you can easily plot
this graph. You can connect the smooth curve using this.
Now, the main question is once given this kind of expression, how to convert this
expression into a standard form? So, that is the question that I will post down. How will
you convert the intercept form into the standard form? Just by multiplying the two
binomials. So, for multiplying the two binomials, we have one rule which I will state in
the next slide.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:17)
So, how the conversion from intercept form to standard form will happen using a method
called FOIL method which is described below. So, the product of two binomials as I
already mentioned that
these are the two binomials. So, the product
of two binomials is sum of the product of first terms the outer, the inner and the last
terms. So, let me make it more precise by demonstrating it.
So, let us consider this expression which is . Now,
what I will do is I will
first take the first term of this expression, and the first term of this expression, and
multiply them together that is the first term over here by the sum of the product of the
first terms I mean this term.
Then I will take the inner term ok, then I will take the outer term, sorry, then I will take
the outer term that is
is the outer term here, sorry, not
the inner term. You have
which is the outer term, and
now you just multiply them together which gives me
is not the outer term,
which is the outer term. So,
which is the outer term
product of the outer term.
Then you take the inner terms that is
. So,
, this is the inner term. And
are the last terms. First term, outer term, inner term and last term that way we will
multiply these things together. That means, I will get the first term as
; and the third term as
Now, if you look at, so basically the
is the
; second term
is the term which is the coefficient of
is the term which is the coefficient of
, and
is the term
which is the which is the constant term right.
So, now, a quick observation you can make is if you look at the product of this first term
and the last term, what will you get
So, the product of the coefficient of
, so it is
, the product is
right.
and the coefficient of constant is
. In a
similar manner, if you consider the coefficients of
, a d and b c are the coefficients of
, so if you take product of these two terms, again it will be
. This is a
crucial observation which we will need while converting a standard form to intercept
form and vice versa.
Just remember this the product of the coefficient of
and the coefficient of constant is
. And the product of the two terms of the coefficients of
; both of them
. So, this we will use to convert our expression into standard form, and convert
our expression in intercept form in various ways. So, that observation is very crucial for
(Refer Slide Time: 08:03)
So, let us do take one example and see how we can apply our knowledge which we have
gained in this particular video along with the previous videos to solve this problem. So,
the question is the write a quadratic equation with roots 2,
and -4 in the standard
form ok. So, let us recollect what is a standard form. Standard form is of
and a, b, c all are integers; and
. This is the standard form; we have already seen
that ok.
So, now, if I want to write this, we will use our knowledge about intercept form, and we
can easily write this expression as
because
and -4 are the roots.
Yes, but this equation is not in the standard form. So, now in the previous slide, we have
seen that in order to convert this into a standard form, we will use a FOIL method. So, let
us try to use a FOIL method. So, the what is
here?
that is a is 1, b is
, c is
1, d is 4 ok.
Now, you use FOIL method that is first terms. So, first terms is
, Then
, so
and a is 1, 4
this is the term which have coefficient of
, and then
, so it will retain
that is the product here
which is the term here.
So, this is successful application of FOIL method.
Now, let us rewrite all these things that is you can sum this and write the sum that is
, so
right. Is this equation in the standard form?
No, because for standard form a, b, c, all must be integers. So, what I will do is, I will
multiply this equation with 3 on both sides. So, if I multiply on both sides with 3, then I
standard form is
that is the solution to this question. So, the quadratic equation in
. So, we have solved.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:09)
Let us now go further and try to see how I will convert a standard form into an intercept
form. Again we will use FOIL method, but in a reverse manner. So, I want to convert a
function quadratic function which is given to me
means, I want to write
to intercept form, that
. So, how will I convert this?
So, what I will do is, I will take this particular function
, and apply FOIL
method to it. How to apply FOIL method to it? I will equate this to be equal to
. Then based on FOIL method, I have this expression which is
sorry
. Now, remember we have done some observations that is the
product of this and this is
right.
So, now, I can equate this equation with this equation. So, term containing
will be
equated with term containing
. Then
. So, I will get
from this expression I can also derive an information that is
that is the product of
the first and the last term and the product of the terms contained in the sum is 30. So,
; and
Now, my job becomes crucial. My job is to guess what those two terms will be ad and bc
right. So, that their product is 30, and if you sum over them, then it must be -13. For that
I will use the prime factorization theorem that was introduced in week-1. So, if you look
at this expression 30, I will get prime factors as
Now, I want the product to be equal to 30, and I want the sum to be equal to -13. So,
based on this, what I can derive is if at all this, this term has to be negative, I should have
some negative factors over here and both of them should be negative factors. In
particular if I combine 5 and 2, I will get 10 and 3, and 10 + 3 =13, but it is not giving
me -13.
So, I will use a trick that multiplication of two negative numbers will become a positive
number. So, it is
which will give me 30; at the same time, it will be the sum
will be -13. So that means, my ad is -10; bc is -3. It does not matter, you can switch also.
You can write bc as -3, and ad as -10 also, it does not matter.
So, now I will substitute these values into this expression, essentially I will rewrite this
expression. So, I will write this expression as
ok. Then what I will do
is I will look at the first two terms; first two terms, and I will take the greatest common
factor from these two terms that is
put in a bracket that is
. So, I will take
, whatever is remaining I will
Here also I will do take the greatest common factor out that is -3, so
you can see these
. Now,
s are same. So, essentially this expression will come if I have
. Now, is this in the intercept form? No, still it is not in the intercept form.
What is the intercept form? It is
this expression and take the 5 out. So,
. So, I will just divide everything by 5 in
this is the intercept form.
So, using FOIL method, I have converted this expression into an intercept form. An
expression was given to me in standard form; I have converted it into intercept form. Let
us see few more examples as this concept is quite intricate. You may need some practice,
you solve as many problems as possible, but I will give you some demo cases, so that it
will be easy to distinguish for you.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:05)
So, let us take let us say you have you have been asked to solve this equation;
Now, here you do not need, you do not really need a FOIL method. What you need is,
just rearrange
and you just take out the greatest common factor which is
this will give you
. So, if I want to solve this, I know
. So,
the things. So, 0 and 8 are the roots of this given quadratic equation. Simple, this solves
our problem for such a simple case, where the constant term is absent right.
Now, let us take another example,
. Now, in this case, you will use FOIL
method obviously but the essence of FOIL method reduces to that the coefficients of
are of the form
is 4, and
, and the product of this and this is
. So, the product
is -4, this is what it reduces to ok.
So, if abcd is 4, and ad + bc is -4, is there any other way out 4 can be factorized only in
one way that is
negative
can write
. And ad + bc is -4, that means, both of them should be
. So, ad is -2, bc is -2. Substitute it in the master equation where you
. So, you have substituted it in master equation.
Now, you go ahead and take out the greatest common factors out, the first expression
will have
out, the second expression will have 2 out. Then again these are product of
binomials. So, it will be
= 0 given in the expression. So, what is the root of this
equation? 2; 2 is the real repeated root of this equation.
Let us go ahead and solve one more example.
. This is quite interesting 25,
you can see is a perfect square 5, and I want to find the root of this equation. Again I will
use FOIL method, abcd is -25, and ad + bc is 0 right. 5 is a perfect square. So,
the factorization, but -25 is there. So, one will be, one 5 will be with a positive sign,
another 5 will be with a negative sign. So, ad can be +5, and bc can be -5 or vice versa, it
does not matter.
Substitute this substitute this knowledge into this expression. So, you take
, take out the greatest common factors that is x and 5 respectively, you
will get this kind of expression. And then you just rewrite them as product of two
numbers that is
, and you have solved. Remember in all these
expressions we have written this in intercept form.
So, all these expressions are written in intercept form. Once you write an expression in
intercept form, it is very easy to find the roots of the equation, or in fact once you write
in the intercept form you have already figured out the roots of the equation.
