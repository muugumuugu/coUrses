Function: Examples
So, let us take a closer look at functions now.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:19)
So, remember that a function is a rule that map's inputs to outputs. So for instance, if we are
looking at numbers, a function could take an input x and map it to x2 , which can also write
given a name saying g( x) is equal to x2 , which says g is the name of a function, which when
it takes an input of the form x produces an output of the form x2 .
And with such functions, we have a notion of a domain that is what are the inputs that are
allowed, the set from which we take inputs. Codomain, what is the set to which the outputs
belong and range which is the actual outputs that this input set generates for this given rule.
So, for instance, we have for this function this relation associated with it, all pairs x comma y
such that x and y are reals. So, the domain and the codomain are both reals, the rule is y
equals x2 , so that is the filter that we put, we only want such pairs.
And if we plot all the points which belong to the relation, we get this graph on the right. And
this actually tells us that the range of the function even though the codomain is all reals, the
range of the function actually keeps this function above 0, so we only get non negative reals
as outputs. Now, we are not restricted to looking at functions on numbers, we can also look at
functions on other sets.
So, for instance, if we look at the set of all people in the universe, in the world, in the
country, in any range of geographical regions, we can look for the function mother which
says, given a person, this will map the person uniquely to the mother of that person. So, this
is a function because every person has 1 mother. So, in this lecture, and in general, when we
are talking about functions in this course, we will look more at functions on numbers. So, let
us look at these a little more closely. What are the questions that we really want to ask about
functions on numbers?
(Refer Slide Time: 2:09)
So, one of the basic questions is, what are the ranges of the values that we can get. So, in
other words, we have a core domain. But what is the range of values that we can actually
achieve through the function. So as we saw, this square function, f ( x)=x2 is always positive,
so we always get something between 0 and 
, there is no upper bound, but we never get
something which is negative.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:35)
On the other hand, if we take a cubic function of this form f ( x)=x3 
3 x 2 +5, then when x
becomes very small, the x3 becomes very small because the cube of a negative number is a
negative number. So, cube have a large negative number, I mean magnitude, the
1000)
1000)
1000)=
10 . So, as we go into negative, large negative values, we
can at large negative outputs, same for large positive values. So, this has a range from minus
 to +
(Refer Slide Time: 3:05)
And then there are some functions like the trigonometric function sin x, which oscillate
between an upper bound and lower bound. So, if you take sin x, usually it is between +1 and -
1. If we take 5sin x, then it will be between
5 and +5. So, this has a bounded range. Even
though we consider all possible inputs, we never go outside this range from 
5 and +5.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:28)
Now, within the range of values that it can take, we are often interested in specific points, in
particular, where the value are a minimum and where they are maximum. So, for instance,
this function that we have seen before f ( x)=x2, it is clear from the graph on the right that at
0 the output is 0 and at all other points is bigger than 0, so it attains its minimum value at 0.
And because it keeps growing indefinitely in both sides, there is no maximum value.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:57)
Now, the cubic function we said grows arbitrarily small as we go to the negative inputs and
arbitrary large. So, there is actually no maximum and minimum, but it has an interesting
behavior in between because it zigzags it goes up, comes down and goes up again. So, there
is something called a local maximum and a local minimum. So, at x=0, it turns around, so it
achieves a maximum value and starts falling briefly and then at x=2 it turns around again.
So, it achieves a local minimum and goes up again. So, we are interested in finding out where
these local maxima and minima are for various reasons.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:32)
And similarly, if we look at something like sin x, then it has, of course, local minima and
maxima, 
5 is a local minimum and +
5 is a local maximum, it is also a global minimum
and maximum because these are the maximum and minimum values that the function can
ever attain. And now, these values are actually attained infinitely often periodically as we go
from left to right.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:53)
Another thing which we are interested in about functions is how fast they grow. Thus one
function grow faster than another. So, if you look at our 2 functions, f ( x)=x2, and
f ( x)=x 
3 x +5, and we look at their 2 graphs, then it is very clear that the red line,
although initially on the right, it is below the green line, it overtakes it, and after that, it is
never going to be below the green line. So, in this way, the cubic function grows faster than
the square function.
Now, why is this interesting? Well, we often see this informally stated in various contexts.
So, let us look at a context which is relevant for you. So, let G( y) be the number of data
science students graduating in a year y. So, as the year increases, so we go from 2020 to
2021, and so on, the value G takes a certain number and hopefully because courses are
growing, this number is increasing.
At the same time, there are jobs being created in data science. So, let J ( y) be the number of
new data science jobs in a year . Now, ideally, you would like that these 2 are comparable,
that the jobs are growing because the number graduates is growing and vice versa. If the
number of jobs increases more than the number of graduates then there is a demand for
graduates and of course, more graduates will opt to study data science. So, you would expect
a demand for this kind of course.
Of course, the unfortunate case might happen the other way around, if suddenly there is a
slump in demand, then people who graduate with a degree in data science will not be
employable and then there will be a reverse trend. So, these are some of the reasons why
when we look at data, we are interested in comparing the growth rate of functions and we will
look at this in the context of the functions that we study mathematically.
(Refer Slide Time: 6:33)
So, to summarize, we will typically study functions over numbers. And we are looking at
many properties of these functions which are interesting to us, for instance, the range of
outputs, where these functions attain local minima and local maxima and what are their
relative growth rates and many other things which we will come across as we go along.
Thank you.
