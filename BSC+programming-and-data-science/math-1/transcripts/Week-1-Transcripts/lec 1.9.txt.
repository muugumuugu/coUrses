Why is a number irrational?

When we looked at the different types of numbers, we started with the natural numbers, move
to the integers, then to the rationals which are expressed as
. And then we argued that the
rationals do not exhaust all the numbers that we need; and in particular, we claim that the 
cannot be expressed as a rational numbers, so it is what is called an irrational number. So, let
us try and ask why 
is an irrational number.

So, the discovery of irrational numbers actually is attributed to the ancient Greeks; and in
particular, it comes from Pythagoras. So, remember that in Pythagoras
s theorem which you
must have studied in school. If you have a right angled triangle, then the square on the
hypotenuse that is the square on the long diagonal side 
 this one, has an area which is the
sum of the squares on the other side. So, in other words, if you have a right angled triangle
and you measure the three sides, you get a2+ b2=c 2. So, from this, knowing a and b, you can
compute c.
So, in particular, if you draw a square which has one and one as its two sides, then this must
be the 
which is the 
. So, you can actually physically draw if you assume that you can
measure out a unit length using some kind of a measure, then by drawing a square, you can
actually construct a length

So, for Pythagoras it was very important to understand how to describe the 
as a rational
number, and he and his followers and many times many years trying to prove that in fact it
could be expressed as a rational number. Much after Pythagoras, about 50-60 years after
Pythagoras, one of his followers Hippasus is claimed to have proved that 
is irrational this
was around 500 BCE.
Now, the followers of Pythagoras had a very mystical idea about numbers, and they felt that
numbers could solve everything. And in particular they were very keen that rational rational
numbers should form the basis of all of what we could call it modern day time science and
philosophy. So, the followers of Pythagoras were really shocked by this discovery of
Hippasus, they found it to be a, I mean they could not argue with it; at the same time they felt
that this discovery could not be revealed to the public because they felt it was very
dangerous. So, in fact, it is said that they allegedly drowned him in the sea to prevent this
from being made public. So, the 
being irrational has a rather colorful history. And let us
see now how Hippasus proved that this was actually the case.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:41)
So, let us assume as in many of our arguments. Let us assume that 
was rational. So, if it is
rational, then we know that it can be written as a ratio or fraction of two integers p and q; and
in particular we can assume that it is in reduced form. So, p and q have no common divisor,
their gcd is 1. So, if we take 
is equal to , and we square both sides, then 
times 
is 2
on the left hand side, and
p p2
times is 2 . So, we get 2 is equal to 2 . So, we can cross
multiply as usual, take the q 2from the denominator on the right hand side to the left hand side
numerator, and we get 2q 2 is equal to p2.
So, what is p2? p2 is p X p. And if it is of the form 2 times something, then it is an even
number, because an even number is something which has 2 as a factor. So, p2has 2 as a
factor. So, p2is an even number. Now, it is a basic fact about natural numbers that if you
multiply two odd numbers, you get an odd number; and if you multiply two even numbers,
you get an even number. So, if p2is even, and p2 is p X p, then both p and p 
 the two copies
must both be even; so p must be an even number in other words.
So, if p is an even number, then we can write p as 2 times something because p is even p
must be of the form two times something say 2a right. So, from this initial assumption, we
have concluded that the numerator of this fraction which represents 
is actually an even
number of the form 2a.
So, now, let us substitute in this equation for p2right. So, p2is (2a)2 is 4 times a 2. So, now 4a2
is equal to 2q 2. So, now, we can cancel right. So, we can take this 2, and this 2, and cancel it.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:39)
So, we have in other words that q2is 2a 2. And if q2is 2a 2, then by the same argument as
before q2is also even, and so q must be even. And therefore, q can be written as the form of 2
times some other number b. So, we have that p is of the form 2 times a and q was of the form
2 times b. But what this means is that the gcd of p and q must be at least 2, because both of
them are even numbers. So, they are both multiples of 2. So, we claimed initially that the gcd
of p and q is 1. We said that they were actually both in reduced form. So, there was no
common factor other than 1. And now we have shown that if we assume that we in fact
generate 2 as a common factor. So, this cannot be the case. So, the only contradiction that we
can resolve with this is by assuming that
could not have been there. So, therefore, 
cannot be represented by any reduced fraction
(Refer Slide Time: 05:32)
So, this argument of Hippasus is a common way of arguing things in mathematics right. To
show that some fact capital P holds you first assume that not P holds, it is negation holds. So,
we wanted to show that there is no way that 
cannot be expressed as rational. So, we said
let us assume the negation. Let us assume that 
can in fact be express as a rational, and
then you take that assumption and derive a contradiction. And since you cannot accept a
contradiction, your assumption must be wrong and therefore, what you tried to prove
originally was correct.
So, in fact, it is not just 
that is irrational, 
is also irrational. Now, 4 is a perfect square.
So, we know that 
 is 2. What about
; that is also irrational. So, among the integers
among the natural numbers we have the perfect squares 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 and so on which
consists of 12, 22, 32, 4 2, 52and so on. So, a perfect square is one whose square root is also a
natural number.
Now, it turns out that anything which is not a perfect square has an irrational square root, and
the proof is not exactly the same because we have used a property of 2, and evenness in this
proof, but with a very similar argument you can show this is the case. So, therefore, there are
a lot of irrational numbers that you can generate just by taking square roots of non-perfect
squares.
