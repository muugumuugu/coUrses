So, now first lecture on Numbers; we looked at natural numbers and integers. So, now, let see
what happens when we try to divide. So, let us look at the rational numbers.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:23)
So, we said that we cannot represent 19 / 5 as an integer because we cannot find a number k
such that 5 
 k is 19. So, as we know the way we deal with this is to represent this quantity as
a fraction. So, we say that 19 /5 is 3 . So, this number is an example of a rational number.
So, rational number what we usually called fractions in school, a rational number is
something that can be written as , ; where, p and q are both integers. So, as you probably
remember from school, the number on the top is called the numerator. So for, ; p is called
the numerator and q is called the denominator.
So, just like we had the symbols N and Z to represent the natural numbers and the integers,
we have a special symbol which is somewhat unusual which is Q. So, Q stands for the
rational numbers and again, to just say it is a special Q, we write these double lines on sides.
So, this Q with these fat boundaries denotes the rational numbers. So, one thing about the
rational numbers is that the same number can be written in many different ways. Now, this is
not true of integers. Of course, we are not talking about changing base from binary to decimal
or something.
But if you write a 7, there is only one way to write 7 fix, if you are fix the notation that you
are using for writing numbers. With rational numbers, this is not true because there are many
ways of writing
such that is actually a same number. So, for instance if we take the
number , then we all know that is the same as
and this is the same as
. So, when we
take a rational number and multiply it by something the same quantity on the top and the
bottom so, , 3 
 2 and 5 
 2, we get the same number;
or 3 
 10 and 5 
 10, we get the
same number
. So, this is sometimes a nuisance, but it is also sometimes useful.
Now, there is no reasonable way to compare two numbers like say
and or and . If we
have two fractions which have different denominators, there is no way to directly compare
them. So, the only way to compare them is to somehow convert them into equivalent
fractions such that they have the same denominator. So, the usual way is just to find a number
such that both the denominators multiply into that number rather factors of that number.
Now, you can find the smallest such number which is called the least common multiple; but
you can find any number of this form.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:05)
So, for instance, if you want to add
and , now you cannot do that directly; but you know
that 20 is a number which divides which is a multiple of both 5 and 4. So, you can represent
as equivalently as
; you can represent
equivalent. So, this is equivalent and this is
equivalent. So, you have converted these numbers into a different fraction of the same
number; but this new representation has the same denominator.
And now once, the two denominator that the same, you can add the numerators and you can
get (12 + 15)/20 is
. So, this kind of manipulation requires the denominators to be the
same and therefore, it is actually extremely useful that we can write the same rational number
in many different ways. The same is to we want to compare two numbers.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:54)
If we want to check whether
is bigger or smaller than , there is no way to do it directly.
What we have to do is again take the denominators and make them the same and then, say
that
is less than
because you are dividing something 20 parts and you are taking 12 of
them that is less than taking 15. Now, as I said there is no reason why this must be the
smallest one. So, for instance you could take a bigger number like 100, right. So, 5 goes into
100 and 5 goes 4 also goes into 100.
So, we could also say that
since 60 is less than 75;
is the same as
and, is the same as
and therefore,
is less than
and therefore, is less than . So, it is not
really important that the denominator is the smallest common multiple of the two
denominators; but it must be some common multiple so that you can bring it all to a common
number that you can then compare.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:49)
So, we saw that representation is not unique for rational numbers. So, how do we find
actually the best way to represent a rational number? So, normally if you are not using it for
some arithmetic operation of some comparison, we would prefer to have it in a reduced form.
So, the reduced form of a rational number is one, where there are no common factors
between the top and the bottom. So,
is of the form, where we cannot find any factor f such
that f | p and f | q.
So, for instance, if we take
, then its reduced form will be . Notice that 3 is of the form 3
 1 and 10 is of the form 5 
 1. So, therefore, there is no common factor between the top
and the bottom and therefore, this is in reduced form.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:42)
So, this is called the greatest common divisor problem. So, we want to find the largest
number which divides both the top and the bottom; both the numerator and the denominator;
divide them both by this and then come to something in the reduced form. So, in this case,
what we are saying is that the gcd of 18 and 60 is actually 6 and we can do this using our
prime factorization that we talked about before.
So, if we look at prime factorization for 18, then 18 is 2 
 3 right; its 2 
 3 is 6 and 6 
is 18 and the prime factorization of 60 is 2 
 5; its 4 
 3, 12 and 12 
 5. So, now, you
can look at what are common. So, we have one 2 here and one 2 here. So, we can say that this
is part of the same factor, we have one 3 here and another 3 there. The second 2 is not present
in the first term.
So, we have a 2 and 3 and 18 which are factors. We have a 2 and 3 in 60 which are factors
and this gives us the fact that 6 is a common factor. There is no bigger common factor
because we want to assemble a bigger common factor, we have to pull out one more prime
from each side; but there is no prime left which is present on both sides. 3 is there in 18; 2
and 5 are there on 60, but we do not have a matching one of the other side right.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:59)
So, this way, the common prime factors are one 2 and one 3 and so, 2 
 3 equal to 6 is the
gcd. Now, this is not the best way to find the gcd, there are more efficient ways to find the
gcd. But this intuitively tells us what the gcd is. You take the prime factorization of both the
numbers and you collect together all the primes that occur in both the numbers, the same
number of times.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:23)
So, here is another interesting property about rational numbers. Now, for each integer, we
know intuitively that there is something which is the next integer and the previous integer. If
I tell you 22 and ask you what is the next integer? Then, you will know it is 23. What is the
previous one? It will be 21. So, for every integer m, the next one is m + 1 and the previous
one is m - 1 and it does not matter, if this is positive or negative. So, for instance if I am at
17, then the next integer is 18, the previous one is 16; right. If I am at -1, then the next integer
is 0 and the previous integer is -2. So, I can always take the integer that I am at, add 1 and get
the next integer, subtract 1 you will get the previous integer.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:10)
So, the property of this next and previous is that there is nothing in between right. So, there is
no integer between m and m +1, there is no integer between m and m -1. So, that is what next
means, it is not some bigger integer or some smaller integer. It is the immediate neighbor in
the integer of the in this number line. Now, what about rationals? Is it possible to talk about
the next and the previous rational number? Now, it turns out that this is not possible for a
very simple reason.
So, between any two rationals, we can always find another one because we can always take
the average of 2 numbers. So, remember that if you take the average of any 2 numbers, then it
must be between those 2 numbers right because it is the sum of the numbers divided by 2. So,
the average cannot be smaller than both or cannot bigger than both. So, if the 2 numbers are
not the same, then it must lie strictly between them. If the numbers are the same, then the
average is the same.
So, if somebody has 37 marks and 37 marks, then their average marks is 37. But if they have
37 marks and 52 marks, even without calculating the average, you know that their average is
bigger than 37, but smaller than 52; right. So, in the same way, if I give you 2 fractions
and I tell you that is smaller than . Remember that in order to do this, we would
have to normally get the denominators to be the same and so on.
But supposing I know that
is smaller than . So, I know that say is here and I know that
is here and supposing you claim that and are adjacent, that is is the next rational
after
. Well, I will say no; let me take these 2 numbers and find its average right. So, this
average now is also a rational number because you can also represent it as
workout this
right. If you just
plus divided by 2, you can simplify this whole expression and you will get
a new number which is also of the form .
So, this is also a rational number and this rational number as we argued must be between the
2 numbers and therefore, between any 2 rational numbers by just taking the average of the
mean of the 2 numbers, I can find another one.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:17)
So, in other words, the rational numbers are dense right. So, dense in the usual sense, so
dense just means that they are closely packed together. So, basically you cannot find any gaps
in the rational numbers because any between any 2 rational numbers, you will find another
rational number and this is not true of the integers because we saw that in the number line,
there is a gap between m and m + 1, there is no integer there right. So, we say that the rational
numbers are dense and conversely, we say that the integers and the natural numbers are
discrete. So, a discrete set has this kind of next property and a dense set has no next property
between any 2 numbers, will find another number right.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:56)
To summarize, we use this funny symbol Q to denote the rational numbers and a rational
number is just the ratio. So, that is where it comes from actually; so, ratio. So, rational
number comes from the word ratio and so, it is a ratio of 2 integers p divided by q. Now,
there is no unique representation of a rational number because we can multiply both the
numerator and the denominator by the same quantity and get a new rational number which is
exactly the same in terms of the quantity that it represents.
And we use this fact for things like arithmetic and comparisons, but if we really want to talk
about rational numbers in a canonical way, in a unique way; then, we get this reduced form,
where we cancel out the common factors using prime factorization. So, that we get a number
whose gcd of the numerator and the denominator is 1.
And finally, we saw that we cannot talk about the next or the previous rational number
because between any 2 rational numbers, there is another rational number. In particular, if
you take the average of the 2 numbers, you will find a number that is in between. So, unlike
the integers and the natural numbers which are discrete for which next and previous makes
sense; for the rational numbers, there is no such quantity.
