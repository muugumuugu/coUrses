One-to-one Function: Examples & Theorems
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, let discuss some examples of a functions that are one to one and not one to one. So,
for this let us first take 
) = |
|; is this function one to one?
(Refer Slide Time: 00:20)
Try let us try to answer this question. So, let me write this function properly. So, if 
 for 
 0 and 
 for 
 < 0. So, it is actually a straight line on a passing through the
origin like this 40 at a 45 degree angle and the 
 is this line ok. So, it is a V shape 90
degrees V; so, is this function one to one? First of all let us let us not take the argument,
first of all is this a function (
) = |
Pass a vertical line, take a vertical line and pass it through this; is there at if there is any
point where two points more than one points pass through this function pass through that
line then it is not a function. So, vertical line test is successful therefore, it is a function.
Vertical line test says that it is a function succeeds and we know it is a function ok. Now,
the question is the function one to one? Right. So, you pass a horizontal line. So, let me
pass one horizontal line somewhere, let us take this horizontal line. Now, is the function
one to one?
For 
2 , I got the same 
) ok. So, how will I prove it is not one to one? Let us take
a value which is say 2 and 
2; these are the two values, 
(2) = 2 = 
2). Therefore,
this is not going to be a one to one function. So, it is not one to one function. So, our
conclusion is it is not one to one function. Then do we know functions that are one to one?
(Refer Slide Time: 03:05)
So, since we have taken 
) = |
|, let us take a function 
) = 
; is this function one
to one? It is a straight line passing through the origin, is this function one to one?
Let us take horizontal, first let us check whether this is a function, take a horizontal line,
pass it through this pass it horizontally, the line parallel to 
axis. So, just drag 
axis
up and down; do you see any point touching more than one point? No. So, it is a valid
function; then, sorry yeah you have to pass the vertical line first ok.
Start with 
) = 
, take a vertical line which is 
axis, slide it to the left, slide it to the
right. Do you see any where it has more than one points? No. So, it is a valid function.
Then take a horizontal line, pass it from the top to bottom; see if you are getting any two
points together for on that line; no. Therefore, this function is actually one to one because
2 implies 
1 ) 
2 ) which is more or less expected right.
Because 
) = 
 therefore, 
2 will give 
1 ) 
2 ). So, what about it is an
exercise then what about if you take a cubic functions? So, cubic function will pass like
this sorry, it is not a correct diagram of a cubic function. So, cubic function let us change
the color as well, cubic function will have something like this, symmetry will be retained
and then this will go down.
So, if this function, now check whether this function is one to one or not. Again the
exercise is very similar, pass a let the 
 axis go up and down, see if you are finding any
two points together. So, let us say this function is 
) = 
 3 and now you can easily make
out that for 
2 , 
1 ) 
2 ). So, again through horizontal line test, I have detected
that the function is one to one.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:59)
So, let us write this particular test as a theorem. If any horizontal line intersects the graph
of a function in at most one point, then the function is one to one ok. So, then what we will
show here, if you want the proof of this what we will show here is if the function is not
one to one then it will intersect some horizontal line will intersect the graph of a function
in more than one point ok. So, that is very easy to prove. So, I will prove it graphically.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:41)
So, if the function is not one to one, let us say this is 
axis, this is 
axis. If the function
is not one to one, I can take this point and call this as 
1 and I can take this point as call
this as 
2 . This is how I can make function not one to one and then pass a curve passing
through these two points and pass the horizontal line over here which we have done several
times now by now.
And therefore, 
1 ) and 
2 ) are same, they both are same. Therefore, the function is
not one to one, that essentially proves the point that if a horizontal line intersects the graph
of a function in at most one point then 
 is one to one good.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:37)
So, we are good to go now. Next thing that we will come is can we identify the class of
functions that are one to one? So, what class of functions can you immediately think are
one to one? For example, we have also seen some functions like if 
2 then 
1 ) 
2 ) or let us not put this strict equality; let us put this way strictly increasing.
So, what does what do I mean by ok; let us can we question is can we identify the class of
functions that are not one to one? So, I can; obviously, think of function of this form 
2 , 
1 ) < 
2 ). Let me plot it and then the my imagination will work fine. So, this
function is something like if 
1 is to the left of 
2 then 
1 ) should always be less to the
left of 
Or, if you are plotting it on the 
axis then 
1 ) below 
2 ), this is the intuition and
you can draw line joining these two points. Let it go ahead and this is true for every 
1 , 
belonging to A this is true; then I am done.
But, this function have a name that is they are called increasing functions ok. In a similar
manner, if I multiply this function with minus sign. Then I will get a function which is
decreasing function and that can be written as 
1 < 
2 employs 
1 ) > 
2 ) and this is
called decreasing function.
Now, you look at any increasing function and apply your horizontal line test. What is the
horizontal line test? Just now we have seen that if you take the horizontal line, roll it across
the axis across 
 axis and there should not be more than one point intersecting that line
at any given point in time ok. So, this increasing function and decreasing function will
satisfy this phenomena.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:47)
And therefore, we can easily write this as through horizontal line test that, if 
 is an
increasing function or a decreasing function then 
 is one to one.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:59)
Let us see one decreasing function as well. What happens when the function is decreasing?
As I go from left to right there is a 
1 is here, 
2 is here. As I go from left to right, I get 
here and now according to the condition 
1 ) > 
2 ). So, it will be somewhere here
and I can have a curve passing through this point in this manner ok.
This is true for every 
1 and 
2 belonging to the domain. And therefore, using our line test,
horizontal line test we can easily see that the function whether it is increasing or
decreasing, they are one to one. This gives us a big class of functions that are one to one.
So, one to one functions are not rare to find, one to one functions are abundant in nature
and they are reversible as well.
With this insight, we will go to our next topic which is exponential functions.
