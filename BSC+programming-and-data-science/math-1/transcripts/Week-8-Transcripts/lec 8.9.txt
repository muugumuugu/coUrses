Inverse Functions
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
Hello Students, in the last video we have stumbled upon one concept, where we could not proceed.
Then we came to
Let us go to the last videos last slide. So, here if you look at this particular
concept we actually stopped while computing. And why we stop while computing is
because we did not have enough information on, how to write t is equal to something given this
equation.
So when, what we did we found escape out by plotting the lines across 
 and y a
is, horizontal
and vertical lines and figured out that the answer is 8 minutes. And that is how we concluded this
is 8 minutes. Now when we start such a thing analytically that is 
 is given to be 30. What is the
value of t? We want to answer such questions then we need to look at the function R and we need
to understand whether this function is reversible or not.
Which is the case, in this case, in this particular function because we were able to map it uniquely.
So, what are the important trades of this function 
 was a one to one function and it was
increasing function. Hence, it was one to one. Therefore, we were able to find a reversal of the
value 30 to the value of t which is 8.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:58)
So, in order to find such reversible functions, we need to understand the theory which we will
discuss now is the theory of inverse functions. So, when I talk about inverse functions, I am talking
about functions from domain which is real line co domain which is real line. So, a function is
define from real line to real line, then the immediate question that comes to our mind, are all
functions reversible? And the immediate answer is a very well-known function that we have seen
is, 
) = 
 2 .
Now this function is not reversible because it feels to pass the horizontal line test, if you remember.
So, 
 2 , if I try to plot, it will be something like this. Very close to something like this. And
when I pass a horizontal line through this it passes through 2 points. And let these points be 2 and
2 . And that essentially means this, when I feed in the value 2, it will give you four. And when I
feed in the value - 2, it will give you the answer to be equal to 4.
Now if this function is reversible, when I feed the value to 4 it can spit out the two values 2 and
2. So, it is not uniquely spitting out the value. Therefore, this function is termed as not reversible
function. Such functions we cannot study the inverse properties or the properties of inverse
functions. However, if you restrict the domain of this function instead of real line to only positive
half of the real line, then you will get one to one correspondence between the values on 
is and
is and then you can talk about inverse of these functions, when it is defined from 0 to 
Now let us look, then the question is, this function is not reversible then which functions are
reversible? That is a question that we can ask now, in order to answer this question, we need to
study some class of functions. So, in last few videos we have already seen that one to one functions
are nice functions. Any function that is either increasing or decreasing is one to one and therefore
we can look at one to one functions for the class of reversible functions. So, here is our answer
that we will start looking at the class of one to one functions.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:51)
Let us look at a simple function a linear function g(
) is equal to 4
. Is this function reversible or
not? So in order to answer this question, let us look at 
) = 4
. So, you can put 
 = 4
. If you
look at 
 = 4
 from our basic understanding of linear equations or rather than linear equations an
equation of a straight line. This is a straight line passing through origin having slope 4. So, if I
want to find a point 
 on this a
is then I will simply transform this as = 
 and this transformation
is unique. Therefore, I can write some function let us say r(
) as 4. And this function will actually
be giving be the inverse of this.
So, let us take this function, if this function 
) = 4. So, I do not need to write r(
)= 4. 
. Now if I start with this function and I want to get value of 
, what should I do? I will write, so I
will write 
 = 4 and in that case I will get 4
. And therefore, I will get another function which
is say 4
). So, essentially what we have seen is this g(
) and h(
) have something in
common. So, let us recollect the notion of composition of two functions, and try to answer this
question.
For e
ample, if I consider the function goh(
). Now this function is again a function and it will
simply operate like 
 of h(
). And once you start with 
 of h(
), what you will do is, you will treat
) as an argument of 
 and put the values of h(
) inside. So, let us try to understand this, so it is
like g(h(
)) is actually, what is g(
)? 4 of 
. So, it will be 4 
). Now what is 
) is
nothing but So, 4 times 
 by 4 which will give me 
. So, what
this function is, this function actually gives me identity function. 
) = 
 and a similar manner
(Refer Slide Time: 8:08)
I can start thinking about hog(
). now in this case, if you recollect the notion of composition of
functions studied in week one, h( g(
)). So, if h of g(
) I will simply see what is h(
therefore what is g(
)? It is 4
 therefore I will get 4
/ 4 which is actually equal to
. And therefore this is also equal to identity function of 
. So, now to summarize what I got is
G o h(
) = 
). Now this becomes our definition of inverse function. And let us define
it formally as the definition of inverse function.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:16)
So, here is a definition of inverse function. The inverse function inverse of a function f, we denote
it by .
1 is actually a function this is our notation 
1 is actually a function such that.
) or
I can rewrite this as 
) = 
. Now here is a typical thing that comes for all 
 belonging to
domain of 
 which is equal to range of 
1 . And 
)) or you can write this as 
being equal to 
)) = 
 for all 
 belonging to domain of 
1 and range of 
So, right now when I did this particular calculation I have assume that everything goes from real
line to real line there was no such event. Because this function is define from real line to real line.
And this function is also define from real line to real line. So, there was no consideration for
domain and ranges. But sometimes it may so happen that your original function maybe define, let
us say 
 is define from 
 to[0,
). If such a definition is there, then you need to worry about the
domain of a function and the range of a function. Because here the domain of 
 is 
 and range of
 is 0 to 
So, if I talk about 
1 of this, then naturally I cannot go over entire real line. I have to go over 0
 and then I have to come to 
. So, this is how it will be define and therefore, the domain of 
will become the range of 
 will become the domain of 
 and the domain of 
 will become the
range of 
1 . This is the typical factor that you need to always remember. Now let us go ahead
and improve our understanding about one to one functions.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:00)
So, if the given function is one to one function then 
1 always e
ist for f. Now the notion may
confuse you. So, let me give you one precise warning that the notion 
1does not mean 
. This is
very important. Because you may quite often confuse 
1 with
. So, whenever we want to
discuss in this course or in Mathematics, whenever we talk about 
) it is simply means it an
inverse function.
So, this is an inverse function and whenever you want to talk about the 
. Then you should talk
about 
1 . So, this 
1 = 
 and this 
1 is actually has a meaning 
) with
this you always remember. Now if 
 is one to one function 
1 always e
ist for f. This you have
to trust me. I cannot prove it right now with the current tools, so 
1 always e
ists.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:11)
Let us take one e
ample g(
) is equal to 
 cube and 
1 of 
 is 
. This you can write as 
 raise
to 1 by 3 as well. So that, this is simple to verify. So, now you want to verify that the given functions
are actually inverses of each other. So, in this case let us first identify the domains, it is a real line
to and range is real line. So, naturally for inverse also it
s real line to real line. Now question about
it. So, let us talk about 
Now if you recollect the definition of inverse function then naturally the inverse function is a
function such that all this combinations, all this combinations should produce 
)) or
)) f. So, let us talk about 
)). So, let us keep 
1 intact and put what is 
) which
3. Now this you substitute the function 
1 of 
 as 
1/3 then this becomes (
3)1/3. Then
multiplication of indices 
 applicable, so it will 
. So, one way it is true.
Now the second way also you have to check. So, what you will do now, is you just write 
 within
the bo
 you write 
) here, 
 raise to 1 by 3. And then simply put the function 
 so 
 raise to
1 by 3 the whole thing raise to 3 which again a raise to m n. So, this will also give you 
 domain
and ranges we have already seen. So, whatever the conditions of that therefore 
 and 
1 are
inverses of each other. So, 
1 is inverse of 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:24)
Let us take this e
ample where we are suppose to verify, whether 
 and 
 are inverses of each
other. So, let us try to verify, you can check the domain and co ranges of these functions. I will
simply start with 
)). So, if I start with 
)) as per our notion what we will do? We will
simply keep this 
 in place wherever 
 has an argument 
. So, we will take this and we will put
 wherever 
 is written there.
So, let us do that e
ercise that is, 2
)+3 =
= 2(3
+5)+3(1
. this is 
 o g(
Now what is g(
)? g(
) is this so let us go ahead and substitute those values over, those functions
in place of 
). So, it is
. So, now it is a matter of your Algebra just simplify this. So,
denominator both have 1 
 in common, so multiply the numerator by 1 
 and denominator
by 1
. So, that we will get rid of this. So, it will be2(3
+5)+3(1
So, what is a question, we have to verify that 
 is the inverse of 
 So, essentially I want to come
up with a number with a function which is 
 o g(
, this is my end goal just remember this.
Now you can simply (multi) simplify this 3
 + 5 - 5 will get rid of this + 5. Let me change the
color over here. So, this will get this one will get rid of this then this is - 2
 - 10
 and - 10
 will
become + 10
. Because of this - sign and then 3. So, I will simply get here 13
Now you look at the denominator which is 2 into 3
 that is, 6
 then look at the corresponding term
here - 6
. So, this 
, terms corresponding to 
 will vanish and 3 and 2 
 5 = 10. So, I will give
get the denominator to be equal to 13 and that will give me 
 as my answer. So, 
 o g(
) is verified.
Does this complete, will this complete our verification of whether 
 is the inverse of g? No, because
I want to check whether 
 is also the inverse of f. Then only the verification will be complete.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:03)
So, let us go ahead and do that, that is we will consider 
 of 
 and that should give me 
 that is
my end goal. So, now you look at what is a function 
 and put 
 as it is everywhere. So, it is 3
times 
 + 5 1 - 2 times 
. What is the ne
t step take the functional form of 
 and substitute
it in the e
pression.
So, 3 into 
 - 5 upon 2
 + 3 + 5 upon 1 - 2 times 
 - 5 upon 2
 + 3 and then again the same logic
applies multiply both sides by the 2
 + 3 and then you will get 3 times 
 - 5 + 5 times 2
 + 3 to
be, upon 2 1 is there. So, 2
 + 3 as it is - 2 into 
 - 5. Let us look at the simplified form let me
change the color. So, 3
 + 10
 that will give me 13
 here 3 into 5 - 15 + 5 into 3 + 15. So, this is
taken care of vanished upon again the same logic applies 2
 - 2
 will vanish 2 into 5 will give me
10 and this 3 will give me 13.
Therefore, I got this domain and ranges you have already verified for yourself and therefore
process is now complete because 
 of g(
) is 
 of 
 is again 
. So, we can verify that 
inverse of 
 as stated. So, this completes our discussion on inverse functions.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:40)
Now it is important to understand graphically what the inverse function is or how the graph of 
and 
1 is changes. So, we already have a wage understanding of the graph of 
 and 
1 . Now let
us look at it formally, so if I know something about 
 or the graph of f, then given a value of a. I
am able to calculate 
 of a and a 
 of a is the payer which we call as graph of 
, graph of f. You
look at 
1 , what happens when you talk about 
1 , here 
 of a is actually on y a
is and a is on 
So, when you look at the inverse function the values on y a
is actually get convert into values of
is. And the values on 
is will actually get converted into values on y a
is. So, this is the
mapping that we have given. So, if you start with 
 of a which is y then you will talk about
)of y and when you talk about 
) you will actually get it to be equal to 
. Because 
). and this is how the entire circle is complete. So, in particular if 
 and 
) is on the graph
 then 
(a), 
 is the graph of 
1 . That is obvious.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:17)
So, let us look at, let us imagine this is the graph. This is the graph of a straight line a, fa. So, you
plot a line 
 here. This is a line in 
 and this is a point which is on the graph of 
). So,
now you are saying that where will this point be, when I talk about 
 inverse. So, then we are also
answering this question that wherever 
 was there it will be f(a) now. And wherever 
) was
there now there will be 
So, in this case you just take this distance and you plot it, you just take the distance on the y a
and choose the distance on 
is here and take the distance on 
is for this point and put that
distance over here. That means it will be somewhere here. And therefore, the point will be
somewhere here and this point is actually 
). So, what we are actually doing when we are
plotting the graph is actually we are reflecting our original function, in the original function is
somewhat like this. Let us say, so it is somewhat like this.
Then what we are doing is we are actually reflecting it along y a
is and it will be very similar
function. Which will look like this. So, this is how the graph of inverse function will look like it is
actually a reflection along y is equal to 
 or reflection along a function y 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:13)
So, in particular the graph of 
 and 
1 are symmetric across the line y= 
. This is what you have
to remember all the time. If you want, you can prove the theorem but there is nothing it just a
graphical prove that, if I want to compute this particular point and if I know that the inverse of this
function e
ist, then you just take length on y and plot it across 
 and length of, length in 
 direction
plot it across y direction. That is what I did a this is actually the prove of the theorem that the graph
 and 
1 are symmetric on y =
 line. That completes our topic on inverse function. In the ne
video we will deal with the inverse functions in a more restricted manner that is, inverse of this
ponential functions.
