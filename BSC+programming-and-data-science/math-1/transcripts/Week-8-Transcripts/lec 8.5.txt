Natural Exponential Function
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
Hello friends, in this video we are going to talk about yet another important function among all
exponential functions is natural exponential function. So, basically the theory of natural
exponential function is derived from calculus. So, in order to understand how relation natural
functional, natural exponential function arises, we need to study the theory of limits. In
particular, this natural exponential function is dependent on something raised to the exponent
that something is in irrational number that is called 
And I will make sure by the end of this video you will understand why this number 
 is very
important. In particular, when we talk about number 
 or ratio or a limit of some quantity is
important which is shown here. So, from the theory of limits it is known that whenever you are
talking about (1 + 
 this particular limit it actually converges to e.
So, now unless you understand the concepts of limits, you may not be able to have complete
understanding of this concept, but still I will give you some intuition behind this number e. So,
though, as I mentioned earlier, the existence of 
 is actually studied in the field of calculus. For
that you may have to do the course which is maths 2, Math for Data Science 2 and you have to
agree with me on certain facts without knowing them or you have to trust me that 
 is an
irrational number and 
 is approximately equal to 2.71828 and so on. It is an irrational number.
So, it will go to never ending decimal representation, it will continue on the right.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:26)
So, these are the facts about e. Now the question that we asked at the beginning of the video is
why is 
 so important? So, to answer that question, let us first look at the behaviour of this
particular number as a limit. So, when I say that n goes without bounds, the number the this
particular function 
) = (1 + 
 converges to e. What do I mean? Let me put it in a proper
formal way.
So, I have generated a table over here for our convenience and let us understand. So, when I
substitute this n, the value of 
 = 1, this number (1 + 
 is simply 2. When I substitute 
10, the number becomes 2.5937. So, does that mean this function will go without bounds? The
answer is no that is why we get the convergence. And such type of questions are studied in
Calculus.
So, when you substitute the further values of n that is, n=100 you have substituted, you got
2.7048. When you substitute 
 = 1000, you will get 2.7169. Now, you can see that you
approaching closer to the ideal value of e. And when you put n =10000, you get 7181 still
because we are writing up to 4 decimal places, we are not really very close to it, but we will
be, we are very close to it, but we are not at that point.
But when I put n is equal to 1 lakh, then I get a value of 
 which is 2.7182 and that is actually
exact representation of this number 
 up to 4 decimal places, correct up to 4 decimal places.
Now, if you go on further and put higher and higher values 
 like you can put it to be a 1
million, 10 lakhs and then you will see you will get further improvement, but because we are
focusing only on 4 digits after decimal, we this requirement is enough for us, this much
calculation is enough for us. Another thing, another aspect in which this 
 becomes very crucial
in accounts this interested calculations.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:57)
You must have heard the term by now of continuous compounding and continuous
compounding actually means the taking ratios with respect to 
 or taking exponents with
respect to e. So, let me demonstrate to you in this manner. Let us say you have invested rupee
1 in a bank and bank is offering 1 % interest rate and you have invested it for 1 year. So, in that
case what is the answer? 1 plus 1 upon 100 raised to 1, this is the answer, 1.01 1 % you will
get if you have invested rupee 1, you will get 1 paisa of interest.
So, now if you go on like this you will have something like (1 + 100)1 raised to so whatever
number of years you have invested in raised to n. Now, when you actually look at the procedure
of the bank, banks do not give you the interest which are given annually, but they credit the
interest quarterly. So, in that case what you need to understand is the interest rate is actually
given in a quarter, so it is computed on quarter and whatever interest you have accumulated,
that interest will be taken into account for the next quarter.
So in that case, basically what bank is doing is bank is taking this interest rates which is 0.01
and it is actually dividing it into 4 quarters, 4 parts because they are giving you a quarterly
interest and then you are actually getting this multiplied in this fashion. So here, if you look at
the interest rate, instead of 1, I have 0.01 as the number and for 0.01 I got this number. So, if
the bank decides, so I will revise the bank decides that I am revising, bank is revising the
interest rate every month, then what will happen?
Then the same logic for single year, for single year remember (1 +
0.01 12
) . So, if the bank starts
revising the interest rate infinitely often, then we are actually talking about something like
(1 +
0.01 
and this 
. In this case, according to our judgement, according to this, this
number was 1 here, now it is 0.01 and this number converge to e. So, based on this
understanding, if you apply the same logic and try to calculate this thing, then it will converge
 raised to 0.1.
This is an interesting revelation. That means, if you invest rupee 1, you just take that rupee 1 
 0.01 that will be the interest accumulated along with the original capital in are bank if the bank
follows continuous compounding. This is how whenever you study finance, you calculate the
interest rate. So, this is for the period of 1 year. Now if you add the period in terms of time,
then it will be 
 0.01
 . So, this is how 
 becomes important. Let us now replace this 1 % by a
generic number which is 
So, what I am talking about now is (1 + )
 and now from the discussion that we have done
this will converge to 
 and when I add the time that is it is more than 1 year, then I have
something like 
 and that is where I will get 
 . So, these are simple understanding why the
number 
 is very important. 
 typically comes when you are considering a continuous
compounding.
I hope I have made the relevance of the number e, irrational number 
 very clear and it is an
irrational number and its exact value is given by this particular expression. It is not exact but it
is approximate which is suitable for our purposes.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:53)
Now let us go further and understand what is a function that we have defined here and it is why
it is called natural exponential function? So, this number 
 as I mentioned now naturally comes
when you are considering continuous compounding. It also comes very naturally in the field of
Differential Equations which is also relaying on our calculus. So, this number 
 has a special
name when you consider differential equations as a area which is called Euler
s Number.
So, you can Google and you can search the meaning of Euler
s number and why it is relevant.
So, that is how this 
 is called a natural exponential. So, now let us formally define the function
that we have just now seen which is 
 raised to 
 as a natural exponential function.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:50)
So, a natural exponential function is defined as 
) = 
 . Then, you may ask a question, what
are some interesting properties of this natural exponential function? Now, the properties will
be very similar to the exponential function that we have studied, but it is special in some sense.
We will see its specialness in a when we will study some special properties of this natural
exponential function 
 . Let us list all the properties.
Domain of f, domain of this function will be set of real numbers and range of the function is
positive real line that is 0 to 
. As you have seen e, the value of 
 is 2.7182 so 
 is natural
greater than 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:51)
So, if you recollect whatever we studied for exponential functions, you will get the graph of
exponential function in this manner where there are two typical points 0,1 is one typical point
that it passes through and it will always pass through 1,e. As x tends to infinity, the function
goes without bounds, as 
, the function asymptotically goes to the x axis so y = 0 is the
horizontal asymptote for this function, we have already seen that. For general exponential
function same properties hold true.
Now what makes 
 special? And what is something special that is not true with general
exponential function. So, in this case, if you look at the point (1,
) and if you draw a tangent
to a line tangent to the curve, that is a line passing through this particular point, the slope of
this line will be e, that is very special. So, 
 is the slope of the line that is tangent to the curve
y is equal to 
 raised to x at (1,e). So, that is one thing.
Then if you look at the area that is covered under this curve from 
 to 1, that area is actually
e, the irrational number e. This you will learn when you will study calculus in maths 2. So, that
is very important.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:38)
And the third thing that is very important which will not happen in general with other
exponential function is if you draw a curve f(x) is e, if you draw a function f( x) = 
. So, you
may be familiar with that function, it will be something like this and something like this. And
in this particular case, if you look at the area under the curve in the in the range 1 to e, this
particular area, this area is a unit area for f( x) =x and remember this 
 is an irrational number
so still it will be a unit area.
Why it is so? this is a matter of calculus to explore, but these are the things, these are some of
the things that makes the function f( x) =
 special function. Let us now understand this
function better by considering an example which will deal with our real life problems.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:43)
So, here is an example which says that let R be the percentage of people who respond to affiliate
links under YouTube descriptions and the purchase and they purchase the product in t minutes
and that particular purchasing thing is a function of time so it is given as the 
 = 50 
 . So, let me give you a brief understanding of the problem.
So, now when you watch some video on YouTube if you, the speaker in the YouTube says that
there are some affiliate links below in the description. Now, if you click on that link and go to
the affiliate site, then what you will do is, either you will purchase or you will not purchase. If
you will purchase, the speaker or the channel owner will get some amount of commission.
Now, here the person who is actually giving the affiliate links is interested in finding the
number of people who are responding in t minutes. So, he has devised a function which is
available in YouTube statistics so based on the data available, he has derived a function, we
are taking the function as it is. So, that function is 
 = 50 
 100
Now, he is interested in answering these questions. What percentage of people responding after
10 minutes? So, how many percentage of people responded after 10 minutes? Then, based on
this function, what is the highest percentage expected? And the third question is how long
before 
 > 30 %? The response rate being 30 % is also a good enough rate.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:54)
So, because you are just putting some affiliate links. So, let us try to understand what
percentage or people will respond after 10 minutes? That means, I want to essentially evaluate
the function as 
10 . So, if I substitute this, it will be 50 
 100
10. that is simply if you
rewrite this as 50 -100 times, this is 2/ 10 which can be simplified to 
2 . And then you can
actually calculate the function 
 to by value of 
2 and you can put the value, that value is
36.46. So, this you can do it using calculator.
Now, let us look at the second question. What is the highest percentage expected? Now you
have to think about this function which is 50 
 100
 . Now, you look at the function which
 or 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:19)
You already know the graph of the function which is 
 raised to x, 
) = 
 . Now, how will
the function look like when you are talking about 
) = 
 has a graph of this form, roughly
this form. Now, when you are talking about 
 of x, when you are talking about 
 of x, you are
actually talking a reflection of this graph along this so that will give you some graph of this
kind, it will never cross x axis but it will go this way.
So, now you have a understanding of how the graph of 
 will look like. But here are some
scaling versions, scaled versions like 100, this is 100 and this is 50. So, now this graph is
actually multiplied with 
 100, this graph is actually multiplied with 
100, but multiplying
with 
 100 will again, what it will? It will actually keep the graph in a similar manner but it
will actually because it is multiplied with 
 100, it will shift in some sense like this.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:33)
One minute let me chose and erase it. So, it will shift like, it will flip here and it will shift like
this. And then, now when you are adding 50 to it, this graph will actually go up by 50 units.
So, this way the changes will happen to the graph and finally graph will look something like
this. You can actually check for yourself. So, basically first multiplying this 
 sign will have
an effect of reflecting the graph along y axis, then multiplied with 
 100 will reflect the graph
along x axis and then adding 50 will shift the graph by 50 unit.
So, you have a fairly good understanding of the graph. Now, you just apply your knowledge
that what is the highest percentage expected? So, in this case, if you understand this, the
horizontal asymptote over here is actually shifted to 50 units because you are transferring to 50
and the graph actually let me clear up the image.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:49)
You can use your graphing tool also and verify that this is the graph. So the graph will look
somewhat like this and it will asymptotically reach to 50 units. So, the highest percentage that
is expected will be 50 %. It will not exceed 50 % based on the graphical analysis. Let us analyse
this graph, instead of graphically analysing, let us look at this function 
 raised to 
 0.2t, this
function in itself will never exceed 1 and as x tends to infinity, this function will actually tend
to 0.
That means, whether I am multiplying by 100 or I am multiplying by 10000, as 
, this
function has to go to 0. So, this entire thing will go to 0 and therefore, 50 is the maximum that
I can achieve. Therefore, my question b is answered as 50 %. Now let us look at this particular
thing, how long it takes before 
 exceeds 30 %?
(Refer Slide Time: 22:06)
So, in this case you just look at the graph of the function, so as I have already described this
will, this is how the graph of the function will look like. Now, there are two ways in which you
can solve. Let us try to see whether we can go ahead formally and solve this. So, essentially I
have been given that how long till 
 >30 %? That means 
 = 30, find are value of t such that
 = 30?
So, 30 = 50 
 100
 . So, 30 
 50 will give me something like 
 20 = 
 100
 . Now,
this is, these 
 signs will cancel themselves off so, this is this and then you simply rewrite this
expression
is nothing but 5 = 
 . Now, I have to stop here because right now I do not
have any ways to see what t will be when 5 = 
 . No analytical way is possible.
Then, what I will do is, so analytically I am stopping here and if I somehow I am able to figure
out how to find t is equal to something, then I can answer this question. But let us now try to
compute this graphically.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:47)
So, in this case,
 = 30 is this point. So, now if you go along this line and then you map this
onto x axis, remember x axis is nothing but the value of t. So, in this case, now you look at the
mesh, this roughly turns out to be 8 that means, t will be approximately equal to 8 minutes. So,
this is how we can without even solving the expression for this, graphically solve the expression
for exponential functions. So, this is one live demo of that. That is all for now. So, we will meet
in the next video where we will actually try to understand how to solve this particular problem.
Thank you.
