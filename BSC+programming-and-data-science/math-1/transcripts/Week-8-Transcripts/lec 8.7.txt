Composition Functions: Examples
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
So, we have understood the theory, roughly the theory behind the function, composition,
composite functions or composition of two functions. So, it's time to get some practice.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:29)
So, let me start with an example. And in that example, let us take you have been given two
functions f(x)=3x-4, and g(x), which is equal to let us say 
 2 these are the two functions that
are given, then you are asked to find two things one is g o f(x), and the other one is obviously
f o g(x), how to find this? Let us start, let us start with a solution.
So, what can be the solution let us take this function. So, let me write it properly, it is g o f(x).
So, as per our theory, we have to write this as g(f(x)). So, g(f(x)), you can treat this as, what is
f(x) now? 
) = 3
 4, and g(x) is x square. So, naturally g(f(x)), so, you go to this function,
you treat this g as g. So, let me write it here, you treat this g as a g of a box, and g(x) is nothing
but this box squared. So, in particular, if I want to write something about this function, this box
right now has an argument which is f(x).
So, I will simply write this as f(x) squared, that is all. Now, the entire process is simplified. So,
now, you do not have to worry about what g is, now it simply f(x)2 what is the f(x) fit that when
you in and you will get (3
 4) 2. Another way to handle this is you can simply write g o f(x)
as g(f(x)) fit in the value of f(x) that is 
 4) and what is 
 4) as per our question,
it is 
 2 . So, 3
 4) will be (3
 4) 2.So, anyway whichever way is convenient to you,
you proceed and you will get this answer correct.
So, what I have done here is I have replaced f(x) in this particular case, I have replaced 
 4 in this particular case I have written f(x) and replaced what is g(x). So, both ways you
can go now.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:01)
Let us go to the second problem that is a f o g(x) and f o g(x) is again can be written as f of g(x).
Clear, there is no question, then there are two ways let us go it the first way, what is f(g(x))?
So, what is f(x) here? 
) = 3
 4 here. So, I will write this as to be equal to 3
So again, let me be very clear about this there should not be any confusion in this. So, what is
 is an argument. So, this 
triangle will be 3
 4. So, now this triangle is replaced
with g(x), that is all. Therefore, your answer is 3x-3g(x)- 4. But what is g(x)? Again, go back
to the question g(x) is 
 2 So, substituted here that means it will be 3
 4 and this is the final
answer for you in terms of f o g(x). So, we are seen how to write the compositions in both ways
g o f and f o g.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:26)
So, here is a quick exercise for you pause the video, do the exercise and get back the get the
answer. So, 
) = 
 + 1 and 
 1. Then simply find g o f(x) and f o g(x). This is an
exercise you stop and get the answer. It will be a good practice to revise the concepts.
