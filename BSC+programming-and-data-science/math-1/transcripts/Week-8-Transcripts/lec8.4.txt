Exponential Functions: Graphing
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
Welcome back. So, I hope you must have done your exercises and you must have
developed some understanding about the exponential functions. Let us try to collect
recollect that understanding through 2 examples given here.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:31)
So, let us first take 1 a which is 
) = 2
 . If you have used DESMOS, you must have
got the figure of the function. But prior to receiving the figure of the function, let us see
what should be the domain of a function.
We have already discussed in greater detail that the domain of a function can be a 
, entire
real line. Now, if you look at this function which is 2
 , this 2 > 1 and the 2
 > 20 which
is equal to 1, 2
 > 20 whenever x is positive correct.
Now, because 
 > 0, then 2
 > 20 ok. So, if 
 < 0, what will happen? 2
 , when 
 < 0
will always be less than 1. This is also possible. But when this 2 raised to; can this 2
become negative? No. So, it is always greater than 0.
So, if you have this understanding, then you can easily write the function has a range which
is (0, 
). So, there is a split from when you consider a point 1, there is something
happening at point (0, 1) right. What is (0, 1)? (0, 1) actually is an 
intercept ok,
something is happening at (0, 1) because I have put 0 here for then it is I am getting 1.
So, (0, 1) is also 
intercept and there is something happening which is going below 0.
Is going below 1, your graph is going below 1 and therefore, this particular thing is going
down, but it never goes below 0. This is an interesting fact because if you consider 2
 , it
never goes below 0.
It cannot go to a negative number. Therefore, will it touch the 
 axis? It will not touch
 axis. In fact, 
 intercept is nil ok, but it is approaching 0. So, the something that is
approaching 0, so 
intercept is actually it will never touch it; but it will actually go along
that line. So, this 
 = 0, it will touch at infinity ok. So, such a thing, we call as horizontal
asymptote ok.
So, such a thing you call as horizontal asymptote. So, with this understanding, these are
the things that I can make out directly without looking at the graph. So, let us now look at
the graph ok, before going to that, let us see what happens to the end behavior. End
behavior of a function as 
So, as 2
 , you consider a function 2
 as 
 increases, this also increases. In fact it increases
at a rapid rate than 
. So, this also should tend to infinity and as 
, we have already
figured out 
 = 0 is the horizontal asymptote. So, 2
 will actually go to 0 ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:29)
Then, the question that we used to quantify while considering the function, what are the
roots of this function. So, do they have any roots? In fact, using graphical method, it is
very clear that it never touches 0. So, there are no roots and the functions increase and
decrease.
So, the domains of increase and decrease like polynomials, we studied domains of increase
and decrease; but here, I think my claim is no need to identify the domains of increase and
decrease. Why? Because you look at a function 2
 , let us take 
2 or 
1 < 
2 , without
loss of generality, we can take this. Then, what can you say about 2
1 and 2
See 
1 < 
2 , so naturally if it is raised to the power 2; 2
1 and 2
2 , this relation should
hold. So, what I am saying is the function is actually an increasing function and increasing
functions are 1 to 1. Therefore, I do not have any doubt that the increase and decrease, it
is only increasing; throughout the real line, the function is only increasing.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:19)
So, let us look at the graph of a function 
) = 2
 . Let us identify the points. So, here
you can identify a point right. So, this point we have seen as 
 intercept and that point
was (0, 1) right. Then, the one in this case, let us look at this point which is 1 and where
will it go? It will actually tell you 2.
So, the point is (1, 2), the second point ok. So, these 2 points are very special points, they
tell you something. So, in particular, had it not been 2
 , but 
 , then that point would have
been (1, 
) and if you mimic this graph over here 
 is over here ok, this is a point 1, this
is the point 0 and this is the point which is 
So, that says 
 > 1; this relation is there, is greater than 0 yeah and therefore, the graph
was a point which lies here, which is here right. As 
, this graph actually goes to
infinity; as 
, this graph goes to 0. These two points is these two point and this is
an increasing function.
As you come from left to right, it increases. So, this is an increasing function, 
 = 0 is the
horizontal asymptote, that is very clear ok. The range of a function is 0 to infinity, that is
also very clear. The domain of a function is entire real line, 
So, we have got all the details necessary for finding this. Now, what it so special about 2
if I replace this 2 with 3, still I will have 
intercept to be 0, 1 because 30 is also 1 and I
will again have domain of 
 to be equal to 
; range of 
 to be equal to 0 infinity; no 
intercept; 
 = 0 will be horizontal asymptote; 
 0. There
are no roots. The function is only increasing.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:19)
And therefore, I will state this as a fact that every 
) = 
 , for 
 > 1 will have same
properties as 2
 . So, I do not there is no need to draw different different values. The
behavior is same only the values will change.
For example, in this case, where you have seen the graph of this (1, 2) is a point; (1, 2) is
a point, suppose I consider 3
 , (1, 3) will be the point. So, only the values are changing;
but the shape, the behavior, everything else that is listed here remains the same. Therefore,
you do not have to draw a graph every time, only thing is you need to evaluate the values
in general.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:15)
So, what is the graph of 
) = 
 in general? It is this way for 
 > 1. So, remember that
line that we have drawn which is that the line for 
, where we have eliminated these 2
points such as 0, this is 1, we have identified what is the case for 
 > 1. You have also
identified the case, where 0 < 
 < 1. So, let us go back and see what happens when 0 <
 < 1. So, if 
 lies here how is the behavior? So, you have already analyzed.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:59)
And let us take this function as 
) and take it to be 
) = 
 and this is 
 . Now,
you do not really have to draw this graph, what you can do is ok. So, 
) = 5
 . So,
here 
 is replaced by 
. So, what will be the change in the behavior?
So, when 
 is replaced by 
, you know its reflection across 
 axis, you have solved
many examples in the assignments. This 
 axis, this is 
; then when I put it as 
, it
will be simply reflected along 
 axis.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:53)
So, if you look at this graph and try to draw a graph of this function, then it should be
something like coming from here going here, it should be something like this, it should
actually look like a reflection along 
 axis. So, let us try to show it as reflection ok. This
will actually go very close, but never touch.
So, let me erase this ok. So, this is how it will look like. So, without actually thinking about
anything else, you can simply draw a graph of 
 ; but still let us try to do it in regular
set up.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:43)
So, what will be the domain of this function? The domain of this function is very clear
because we have used it several times, the domain of this function will be real line. Range,
nothing changes; (0, 
) because it is a reflection across 
 axis. So, let us look at this
function.
So, the domain will be 
; range will be (0, 
). What will be the 
 intercept? Because it
is a reflection, so 
 intercept would not change, so it will be 0, 1 only. 
 intercept will
be nil, there would not be any 
 intercept.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:25)
And therefore, no roots and what about the end behavior? End behavior is like 
. So, when 
, the end behavior will be because it is a reflection you see.
So, when 
 there, it was going to 
. So, and 
, function 5
 would have
behaved, it will go to 0. So, that reflection will make this 
 or 
 whatever is the
function 
 , let me do it properly.
So, this will make 
 to go to 0 and this function 
 will go to infinity ok. Good. Then,
because it is a reflection, the increasing thing will become decreasing. So, there is no
intelligence here. So, this will be in fact a decreasing function wonderful. So, we have
analyzed everything without taking much efforts. This is the beauty of once you
understand the functions on graphical plane.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:03)
So, here is the graph of a function which is given to us 
 , you also might have plotted
and naturally, the we will analyze whether it coincides with our thing. So, this is a point
(0, 1), now it is 5. So, your point will be somewhere here, sorry this is 5. So, the point 1 is
here and this point is 5.
So, 
1, 5
, this is done. Then, as 
 , this function goes to 0. As 
 that is this
way, this function actually goes to 
 and this function is decreasing. From left to right if
you come, you are actually coming down. So, it is a decreasing function. So, this
completely gives us an understanding of what the graph of a function will look like.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:17)
Also, the same fact is true that every 
) = 
 , where 0 < 
 < 1 has same properties as
 . Therefore, it is a representative class. So, you do not have to worry about the because
it is a representative class, you have to worry about all other functions. All other functions
will have a similar behavior.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:47)
So, we have done a lot, let us summarize these things in a neat table which is this. So, this
is the summary of the table. So, if I have been given a function 
) = 
 , then to be more
precise, let me draw a line here. This is a line; it does not look like a line, but assume that
this is a line.
This is the point 1, then I am talking about 0 < 
 < 1 that this zone. In this zone, the
domain of a function is 
; range of a function is (0, 
) . There are no 
 intercepts, no;
intercept is 0, 1. Horizontal asymptote 
 = 0 is there. The function is decreasing. The
end behavior as 
 0; as 
 correct.
Then, you look at the function which is 
 > 1, domain is real line, range is (0, 
), nil; (0,
1), 
 intercept is (0, 1). Horizontal asymptote is 
 = 0. The only distinguishing feature
is the function is increasing here and a function is decreasing here and because it is
increasing and decreasing, the end behavior changes that is because it is decreasing, it will
decrease to 0 because it is bounded below by 0 and because this is increasing, it will
increase to infinity, but here it will go to 0 ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:21)
Then finally, you see the prototypes, just look at the graphs of these two functions ok. This
ends our topic on exponential functions. Now, we will introduce something which is called
natural exponential function in the next video.
