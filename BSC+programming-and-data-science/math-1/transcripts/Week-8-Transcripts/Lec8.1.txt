One-to-One Function: Definition & Tests
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
Hello students. Today, we are going to start a new unit called exponential functions and
logarithmic functions. In that our goal today is to understand exponential functions. For
studying exponential functions, a concept of a One-to-One Function is very much relevant.
So, we will first study that concept. Then, we will go to a definition of exponential function
and properties of exponential functions as we studied for polynomial and straight line case.
Then, we will define one interesting function which is called the natural exponential
function, and I will justify why it is called natural and what are the properties that it shares
with the mathematics world.

So, let us start and I think it is time to start and let us start. So, first let us go to a concept
of one-to-one function. In order to define the concept of one-to-one function, let us quickly
recall, what is a concept of a function? So, whenever I talk about function, I will talk about
). This 
 when I say I need some domain let us say A and I need some co-domain
In general function can be defined on any two sets, but for us let us consider to simplify
our understanding. So, that we will understand in terms of coordinate plane A and B to be
subsets of real line, ok. So, now my domain according to this definition is A, and codomain is B. So, now, what is the function? Function is a relation between one set to the
other set. So, it is a mapping that assigns values from one set to the values of other set.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:16)
Let us describe this function as something like this, ok. So, let us see this is the set A which
we will call as domain, and this is the; this is the set B that we will call as co-domain. This
is A this is B. What does the function do? If we feed some value of 
 from this set, it will
process the value and spit out or give us 
It is like a popcorn machine; you are feeding in the corn and getting out the popcorn. So,
this is how the function works. Now, let us see, what are the cases that can happen?
Suppose, for same value we are getting different outputs that, is the case, when you
consider one 
 more than one 
), ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:10)
So, now, is this a function is a question mark. We will soon answer the question. Then, it
can so happen that you have fed two different values and you are getting the same output,
ok. Is this a function? We will answer the question. And, for every single output that you
produce, there is a unique output that is produced by 
, that is a one 
) only.
So, let us analyze these three again is this a function this. So, let us analyze all these three
things together. So, let us start with the first case that is, one 
 more than one 
). The,
what do I mean by one 
 more than one 
). Suppose, I have put 
1 . If I put 
1 as a value
if ones gave me 
1 ), other time it gave me 
1 ) which are not equal.
Is this a function? Is this a well-behaved function? It is not. So, I will say no, no this is not
a function. Therefore, the first thing the first case I will say is not a function. Because, we
are dealing with coordinate plane, let us understand this function with the coordinate plane.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:37)
So, what happens here is suppose, I have been I am taking the value one value 
1 on
axis. Let us say this is 
axis, let us say this is 
axis. And now, I am taking one
value of 
1 . So, one I once I fed in I got something which is 
1 ) here. And, other time I
fed in I got something which is 
1 ) here, ok. Now, what is this? This is actually while
if at all some curve I have to draw, it can be like this.
And, what happens here is for same value of 
 you are getting two different values. Then,
your function is not well behaved, because I do not know which value will come when I
fed in 
1 . So, in that case how will you identify whether something is a function or not?
Sometimes, if you have a graph of a function the way it is given; it is very easy to see;
what is not a function.
For example, if you take a line which is 
 = constant. If you take your line which is 
constant and if I draw that line vertically. For example, let us say here this is the line 
constant; 
1 in fact I have drawn. So, if I draw this line vertically, then I can see that
there are two points at which, this line intersects the graph of a function.
When such a thing happens, we say a vertical line test that is, this is the vertical line right
it is a parallel to 
axis. Therefore, this line passes through two points; that means, there
is something fishy about the function and we will use this as a vertical line test. And say
that, because vertical line test fails, this particular function is not a function sorry, vertical
line test fails and hence, this cannot be a function.
Can you imagine such a function where can you imagine such a relation where this is not
a function. For example, ok. Let us not imagine right now. Let us come to the next case
and generalize it to the other set up. So, now let us see here. So, first thing is not a function
that is very clear. Now, let us take the second case which is more than one 
 and one 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:41)
So, let us understand it on a paper. So, they are more than one 
1 and 
2 , both are not
equal, but somehow, they give the output which is equal, ok. In such case, what happens?
So, as usual general this is domain set A, this is a co-domain B; 
 is processing unit and I
have processed I have given I have fed in two different values of exercise, but the output
produced is same.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:27)
So, is this a function or not? The answer is this is a function. And, in this case let us see,
how it happens? So, let us have some understanding about 
1 and 
2 . So, naturally 
2 and I got 
1 ) which is this and I got 
2 )which is this, ok. Both are same.
And, then how will the function look like? I can join a curve like this, where the function
actually passes through these two points and I have a curve like this. So, if this is the curve
then these two points are same. And, do you call this as a function? Yes, we call this as a
function. Based on our understanding of the function lecture we call this as a function. In
this case, something interesting has happened. Let me analyze it in a more thorough
manner.
For example, when I considered the first case let me go to the first case. I have drawn a
vertical line and I said that, because of this vertical line I can say this is not a function; I
can say this is not a function. Now, the similar graph has appeared over here, but now if I
draw a horizontal line I have a horizontal line, which passes through two points and I am
saying it is a function, correct?
So, if I rotate this graph by say 90 degrees and flip it over then, what I am getting is a
graph similar to this function. So, this actually helps me in understanding that, if I want to
write 
 as a function of 
, I am able to write it. But, if I want to write 
 as a function of 
that is simply just flip this by rotate this by 90 degrees and flip the 
 axis. That will give
you the exact understanding of the picture. And, from this to this I cannot go, ok. And
therefore, the horizontal line if I draw it passes through more than one points.
So, what will happen is; suppose, if I take; if I take 
1 here, if I take a point in this domain
1 . And, if I try to setup another processing unit let us say 
, and if I feed that 
1 into g,
what I get if I use this 
, I will not get something which is similar that is I will get
something called 
1 ) once. And, if I feed in again 
1 , I will get something else as 
1 ).
That is what is happening.
For example, here if you locate this point, this point it is say 
. Then, once you feed 
 into
 then, 
) you will get as 
1 and if you feed it other time 
), you will get as 
Something interesting happens. What I am trying to do is, I am trying to reverse the
function and I an easily say that this function is not reversible.
If this is a interesting point which will help us in gaining more understanding of
exponential functions. So, if this function is not reversible and a horizontal line test
actually detects whether a function is reversible or not; so, this horizontal line test fails;
horizontal line test actually fails in this case.
So, what happens here? Here, when you applied vertical line test that is case 1, it was not
at all a function. Here it is a function, but our conclusion is it is not reversible. Let us look
at this 3rd case, where only one 
 is there and one 
) is there. So, here is 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:42)
So, if I substitute 
1 and 
2 as two different values, then I will get through this processing
unit, I will get 
1 )and I will get 
2 ) and both of them will not be equal to each other
for 
2 . That is the only way it can happen right; one 
, one 
 to one 
). So, if I
take different 
) I will get different values, ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:12)
So, what will be a typical behavior of such functions? Let us try to figure out. Let us say
this is the; this is one function. So, is this function one-to-one? The answer is yes, because
if I take 
2 here this is 
1 ), this is 
2 ). So, for every one, if 
2 , 
1 ) is not
going to be equal to 
2 ). Such function is called one-to-one function. And is it a
function? It is a properly defined function, yes.
So, now, I can summarize using this as, this is a function. In earlier case, we actually
characterized whether it is reversible or not. What can you say about this new function that
you have defined? This function; so, now because for 
2 , 
1 ) 
2 ). So, if I
start this as 
1 and if I start with this as 
2 , I can easily retrace back 
2 that is 
 there
will be some function 
 such that, 
1 = 
1 ) and 
2 = 
2 ).
So, this function in some sense is actually reversible. We will come to this point in more
detail in the next section. Right now, remember that the function that is one-to-one is
reversible and it is reversible. We need to be more precise and I will give you a word for
reversible function in the later lectures. But right now, it is an important observation that
there are three cases. These three cases actually deal with a function.
The first one is not a function; first one is not a function, why? Because we had dealing
with the coordinate plane. The vertical line test fails when then you pass a vertical line that
vertical line will pass through two points or more than two points, then it is not a function.
So, then we said the second case. The second case was more than one 
 and one 
). In
this case, what happened is we were able to find a function properly, but we were not able
to revert the function. So, we said the function is not reversible. And, on what basis we
have said? We have said on the basis of horizontal test, ok. And, we have related this with
our first case that is, if the function is not reversible then the other part that is g is not also
is not a function as well.
Third case where we have one 
 and one 
) we showed that it is a function and it is
reversible also. This brings us to a question that, one-to-one functions how easy are they
to identify; how easy are they to identify? So, let us properly define a one-to-one function.
One in the domain, one in the co-domain and there is a clear cut association that is given
by two.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:23)
So, our definition; give a function 
 is said to be one-to-one if, for every 
2 which
belong to the domain of a function, 
1 ) 
2 ), ok. The other interpretation is, if
1 ) = 
2 ), this should imply 
1 = 
2 this is the other interpretation of definition, but
we will use this as a definition. But, sometimes it may be difficult to prove this thing in
that case, you can prove the one written in the orange.
