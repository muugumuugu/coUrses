Exponential Functions: Definitions
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
Welcome back. Next topic is Exponential Function. So, in this topic, what we will see is
first we will identify with some known terminology that is exponent. We have already
know seen this exponent. Where we allowed integer powers and then while defining the
exponents, we allowed rationals also. So, when we defined exponents, they were of the
form 
 and we always assume 
 > 0 and 
Now, I want to define an exponential function. So, as the name suggest, exponential has
to do something with the exponent. So, what we are doing here when I am considering a
function of this form, I am raising something, some number to the power of 
 where a will
be popularly called as base and 
 is the exponent. So, this is base and this is exponent.
Now, if I want to define exponential functions on real line, then it is mandatory for me to
define this 
 for 
. This is real line minus set of rational numbers that is I am
talking about set of irrational numbers. So, I do not know as of now what is a definition of
exponent form of set of irrational numbers ok.
The next question that we have seen is why is 
 > 0 that for which you know the answer.
Let us say 
1 now
1/2 = (
1)1/2 = 
 which belongs to complex set of complex
numbers, but I do not want to deal with complex number so, I am avoiding a to be greater
than 0. In general, you can define 
 to be a negative number and then deal with complex
numbers. We do not want to indulge into that conversation. So, I do not; I do not want to
define 
 < 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:12)
So, 
 < 0 is eliminated now the question is 
 and r belongs to irrational where 
what will happen in this case? Or how will I define rational number?
(Refer Slide Time: 03:24)
To be precise, let us ask a question that is can I define 2
2 or 5
 ok. So, in this case, there
is no direct way to answer this question, but I will definitely have a strategy which is a
calculus-based strategy to answer this question.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:52)
Let us consider this 
 and the value the numerical approximation of 
 is actually we all
know 
 is an irrational number and 3.14592635
 and this thing is non repeating it will
continue till infinity right. So, now, what I need to understand is from what I know, can I
define the number 5
 ? So, anyway I cannot define it accurately right now.
So, based on my understanding, I am asking you a question that is 53 ? Right if so, then
next question is 53.1 defined? So, what I am doing here is this if yes, can I define 53.14 ?
Now, you remember all these a approximations are actually a rational approximations 3 is
a rational number, 3.1 is 31 by 10 which is again a rational number, 3.14 is 314 by 100
which is again a rational number and I can go on like this there is 3.141 and so on.
So, if I continue this way, I will reach somewhere; I will reach somewhere and that
somewhere I will call as 5
 . So, in principle, I can actually define 
 raised to irrational
number. This you will study when you will study a topic of sequences which is outside the
scope of this syllabus. So, we will assume that you have to trust me on this that 5
 is well
defined.
In a similar manner, you can do an exercise for 2
2 . So, 
2 = 1.41 
 and something. So,
again you will go with 21 is defined 21.4 is defined, 21.41 is defined and so on and you will
reach somewhere that is 2
So, this way we are very clear that 
 is defined for 
. This sets up the platform for
defining an exponential function, this is very important a raised to 
 is well defined for
This answer is given by convergence of sequences which is outside the scope of the
syllabus, but we know that it exist for sure. So, I am guaranteeing the existence of 5
existence of 5
 is assured. In case you are interested, you can take a basic course in analysis
or; in analysis or calculus where you will study these things ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:27)
So, now let us go to let us recall all of these laws you already know simple laws of
exponents. Earlier, we have we knew the laws of exponents for only rational numbers.
Now, we are talking about the real numbers. So, 
 > 0, 
 and 
 will play a
role of exponents, 
 and 
 will play a role of bases ok. So, then it is very easy to prove you
might have proved. 
Remember here, product here is becoming addition here these are crucial points (
 . So, 
 raised to operation is becoming a product here. (
 and then;
obviously, you need to know that 1
 = 1 for every 
 = (
) , 
0 = 1.
Remember where your 
 > 0 because 00 is undefined ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:18)
So, with this understanding, we have revised laws of exponents which will which we will
use the left and right. So, you better remember all these laws and therefore, we are ready
to set a framework of exponential function. So, here is our definition. An exponential
function in the standard form is given by 
) = 
 , where 
 > 0, 
 1. These are new
condition that we have introduced.
We have seen why 
 > 0, but here they are saying 
 1. So, this needs further analysis,
we will analyze it in due course. So, right now, if you look at the values of 
 > 0; that
means, all these values are allowed and 
 > 1; that means, all these values are also
allowed. Bearing the values 0 and 1 right.
So, the first from the definition, the first observation that you can figure out is because you
have bared the value 0 and 1, the function 
) = 
 will have a domain which is entire
real line. For every , 
, we should be able to compute 
 ok.
Then, let us analyze this is then observation: why 
 1? Let us put 
 = 1. So, 
) = 1
but from the laws of exponent what you know? 1
 = 1.
Therefore, 1
 = 1 in fact; it is nothing, but a constant function. I am not interested in
handling a constant function right which nothing, but a horizontal line 
 = 1 is the graph
of a function; I am not interested in this. So, let us not call this as exponential function that
is what we are saying in the definition.
So, hence forth, we will never talk about 
 = 1, 
 = 0 or 
 < 0. So, if you have a real
line, you will have an expression of this form where you are talking about this interval,
open interval and this interval, which is an infinite interval. So, you have two
characterizations which is 0 < 
 < 1 , 
 > 1 these are the two characterizations that you
got over this thing.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:18)
Now it will be interesting to use some graphical tool and see what are some functions of
this kind look like. So, here is an exercise that I will give you. Use some graphing tool like
Desmos and plot these functions together. For example, you plot the functions given in 1
using Desmos we just put 
) is equal to this, 
) is equal to this and this and plot all
these three graphs together without any understanding about the behavior of the function
you plot all three of them together.
Then, use the 2nd graph and put all these three things together. Identify the properties of
the graph that is through which points they pass through is there any difference in the
graphs of 1 and 2. So, identify all these properties like we did in polynomials and after
doing that again return back to this video and we will see some of the functions that are
given here by a graph and we will analyze those functions. So, right now you pause the
video, come back in the next video.
