Hello mathematics students. In this tutorial we are going to look at questions based on graphs of
polynomials. So, in this question there is this polynomial 
) whose graph is given here and we
are supposed to comment on the following statements, the number of turning points, so that is easy
so there is a turn here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. So, there are 7 turning points. And then we are asked
the number of roots, so roots would be where the polynomial touches or cuts the 
 axis so that is
1, 2, 3 and 4 and 5, so there are 5 distinct roots.
Now, what is the minimum possible degree? Minimum possible degree of this polynomial based
on the number of roots. So, the minimum possible degree would be the same as the number of
roots so if there are 
 roots to a polynomial then it should have a degree of at least 
, so 5 is the
minimum possible degree of this polynomial based on the roots. But now they are asking what is
the minimum possible degree based on the turning points.
So, here we see this thing a straight line has no turning points, a quadratic equation has 1 turning
point and a cubic would have 2 turning points at most likewise a quartic that is a fourth degree
polynomial would have 3 turning points at most. So, if you have 
 turning points, then the
minimum possible degree of the polynomial would be 
 + 1. So, here that is 8.
Now, what would be the minimum degree of the polynomial given all the information we have?
Then you know that it has to be at least 8 the five which is on the basis of the roots is a lesser
number than it and we know already that it has to be at least 8, so the minimum degree of the
polynomial should be the greater of these two which is 8 because 6 and 7 and 5 are not allowed on
the basis of turning points.
And then we are being asked what is the end behavior and the coefficient of the highest degree
term. So, the end behavior shows that the polynomial is coming from 
 and going to 
 which
means the degree of the polynomial is definitely even. So, we can say that it is an even degree
polynomial.
So, as you can see we have just drawn these basic raw curves for the linear and quadratic and cubic
and quartic polynomial. So, linear which is an odd degree polynomial it comes from -
 and it
goes to +
 whereas quadratic a parabola here it is coming from -
 and it is going to -
So, when it is even degree you see that the ends of the curves are in the same directions. Similarly,
for quartic here this is coming from 
 and going to 
, whereas for a cubic this is coming from -
and going to +
. So, here this is coming from 
 and going to infinity.

Therefore, this is a even degree polynomial and the coefficient of the highest degree term. So, the
coefficient of the highest degree term determines whether the behavior of the polynomial as x
increases whether it is going to +
 or -
 , if the coefficient of the highest degree term is positive,
it goes to +
. So, if this is going to +
 so this has to be positive coefficient for the highest degree
term.
