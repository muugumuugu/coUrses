Question 8 is very closely related to question 7, we again have the same, quadratic into
monomial into monomial is the same polynomial and again the same set is given to us. Now
we have to see the correct option for 
) to have four distinct real roots, that means a root
should not be equal to each other and that is a catch.
So, we have already seen that 
 16 the discriminant being equal to 0 will give us equal
roots. So, this case is not done, this time the discriminant has to be greater than 0, so that would
indicate |
| > 4, so you will have (
(4, 
) for the quadratic condition. The other
condition here is that the roots for the quadratic should not be equal to 5 or 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:24)
So, these routes which are
this should not be equal to 5 or 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:46)
So, for finding that condition let us start with
= 5 let us start with this and you get
 16 = 10 and that would mean 10 + 
 161.
Now if you square this we do not need to worry about the plus or minus, so let us square it and
we will reach 100 + 
 16, 
 2 and 
 2 goes away. So we get 20
 116 and that would
imply 
 5.8. So when 
 5.8 the root of the quadratic part will be equal to 5.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:52)
So the root of this part will be equal to 5 and that is not allowed, so we should somehow
eliminate 5.8 from this set, 
 5.8 from this set.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:08)
And further let us check for three case where
 3 so we first check when is it equal
to 3 and that gives us 
 16 = 6 that gives us 
 16 = 6 + 
 and that further
gives us 36 + 
 2 + 12
 16. So 
 2 and 
 2 canceled off and that gives us 12
this implies 
which is essentially for 3 and 4 13, so
(Refer Slide Time: 4:09)
So, 
 should not be also be equal to
, so which of these options does that is here we see
option c is goes from (
5.8)
5.8,
) and keeping it open interval we are basically
exploding 
5.8 and similarly the open interval on the
excluding
side on in this and this is essentially
and lastly we are doing the union with 4, 
. So, this is correct, we are excluding
all values from 
4 and 4 and also excluding 
5.8 and also excluding
