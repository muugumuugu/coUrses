Graphs of Polynomials: End behavior
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
So, now we have understood how multiplicities affect the polynomial and how we are able
to find the multiplicities of the polynomial functions with some factors, correct? Still we
do not have an answer to a question that what why what is deciding this behavior that this
function will go to infinity, this function will go up as usual, how this behavior is decided,
we do not have any answer for that.
Let us try to understand that through end through what is called end behavior of the
polynomials. So, the next slide is actually the end behavior of the polynomials ok. So, let
us go to the next slide, it is end behavior of the polynomials.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:09)
So, what is an end behavior of the polynomial? In order to understand end behavior, let us
define an end behavior properly based on our understanding of quadratic equations. So,
when we studied quadratic functions, we looked at the term of the form 
 2 + 
right and then, we talked about 
 2 whether 
2 > 0 or 
2 < 0, then we decided the
behavior of the function.
2 > 0, then we said yes, if 
2 > 0, the function will take its minimum and therefore, it
will go from both sides to infinity. If 
2 < 0, then the function will take its maximum and
from both sides, it will go down and it will be unbounded. Now, from the graphs that you
have seen in the earlier lectures as well as in this lecture, it is very clear; it is very clear
that these functions, polynomial functions are either increasing or decreasing based on the
way they wish right.
So, for example, it can be like this also. So, or it can go like this also or it can be a straight
line as well, if it is linear or it can move like this. All these are polynomial functions. So,
now, we want to have a better understanding. So, what is the behavior of a function after
it has passed through all the roots is the question right, that is the term that was troubling
us a lot.
So, for quadratic equations, we have decided that it is basically based on a 2 because
quadratic equation the highest degree is 2. So, a 2 it is. So, now, in a similar manner, if I
want to consider a polynomial function 
1 + 
0 . Then, the
behavior should be decided by this term.
Why should I make this claim? Because if you look at 
 , what we are looking for is as
the value of 
 increases or as the value of 
 decreases. Now, it is not in that zone, where it
is passing through many roots. So, it has passed through all its possible roots and now,
after that how the function will behave? There is no determining factor right.
So, in such case, the only determining factor is the term 
 ; why? Because for large
values of 
 this term 
 will dominate all other terms corresponding to 
 raised to n
will dominate 
1 , and so on that is when 
 is becoming large. When 
 is becoming
small that is 
 is tending to 
, the term 
 will be the small 
 will be the smallest
possible term or if we that n is of even degree, still it will be the largest possible term.
In any case, the behavior of 
 will play a dominant role in identifying the behavior
beyond roots of the polynomials or beyond zeros of the polynomials. This behavior we
will call as end behavior of a function and for polynomial functions, it is determined by
the leading terms that is 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:17)
If this 
 > 0, and 
 that 
 is a even power exponent is even, then as 
 increases or
decreases, it is very similar to quadratic. As 
 increases or decreases, 
) will always go
to infinity. If 
 < 0 
 is an even exponent, then whether 
 increases or decreases, 
will go to 
. It will go on decreasing. Good. Then, what if 
 that 
 is the exponent
which is of odd power or exponent is odd. What happens?
 > 0, then as the function increases, 
) also increases. If 
 > 0 and it is of odd
power as 
 increases, 
) also increases; as 
 decreases, 
) also decreases and both
are going to infinity; one is going to 
, another one is going to 
. They both are
unbounded. Similar thing can be argued for 
 < 0. So, in order to improve our
understanding, I have tabulated this zone; 1 minute, let me remove this part ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:07)
So, this is the better understanding. So, now, you look at the leading term 
 So, this is
referring to 
 is of even degree, 
 is of odd degree. So, if 
 is of even degree and 
0, x tending to 
 becoming larger and larger, 
) will become 
) will also
increase. 
 > 0, x tending to 
; that means, 
 is becoming smaller and smaller and
smaller; but because the polynomial is of even degree, it will again go to 
In a similar manner, if 
 > 0 and the polynomial the leading exponent is of odd degree,
then as x tends to 
) tends to 
. You can imagine a function of the form 
 3 .
Similarly, if 
 > 0, x tends to 
) will also go to 
because 
) will also keep
decreasing.
Remember polynomials of odd degree crossover x axis, if you link that point to this, then
naturally it is very easy to and visualize the behavior of the polynomials. I will demonstrate
these two graphs again, once again to reiterate the point. If 
 < 0, now 
 < 0; that
means, 
 becoming larger, 
) the term, the leading term of 
) will be negative more
and more negative.
So, 
) will tend to 
; but if 
 is becoming smaller and smaller, the exponent is of
even degree, still 
) will again go to 
 because 
 < 0. Come back to odd degree,
here the exact replica of what we have done for odd degree when 
 > 0 will happen.
So, in this case when 
 > 0, 
 tending to 
, we will make bring this 
) to go to 
but in this case, it will bring it to 
 and similar case is true for the other part that is x
tending to 
) will tend to 
. Let us visualize it through graphs.
Let us take this first block even degree 
 > 0. Imagine a function of the form 
 2 or 
as x tends to 
; both of them are going up. Just remember this figure that will clear this
understanding.
Let us go to odd degree with 
 > 0, as 
 tends to 
, here this is going up. This is going
down right. Just imagine a figure of 
 3 for the convenience. When 
 > 0, just imagine a
figure of 
 2 or 
 4 , both of them should naturally go down. That is what is written here
as well. In a similar manner, just consider 
 3 .
So, whatever was going down, will go up and whatever was going up, will go down that
is what I meant when I said this. So, now we have much better hold over end behavior of
polynomials. Now, you can look at the graph of a polynomial function and you by looking
at the end behavior, you can say whether the polynomial, the leading term of the
polynomial is of odd degree or even degree.
That is one more understanding, one more level of understanding that we have achieved
through understanding this end behavior. But that is not over. We further need better
understanding of the functions.
