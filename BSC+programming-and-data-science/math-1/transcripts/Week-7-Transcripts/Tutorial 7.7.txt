In this question, we are given a polynomial 
) which is a product of a quadratic with a
monomial and another monomial. And the quadratic has some variable 
 in it, capital K is the
set of values of this small 
, choose a correct option if 
) always has 4 real roots but they
need not be distinct and we already know that 5 and 3 are roots because of these two
monomials. So, what is remaining is that our quadratic equation also should have roots.
And for that the discriminant which is 
 16 should be 
0. That would indicate 
 16,
thus 
, the magnitude of 
 4. If 
 4 you get a repeated root you get the same root twice,
so what corresponds which option corresponds to this is a because you go from 
 to 
4 and
then 4 to +
 and their union and 4 and 
 4 are with closed intervals therefore, they are
included.
