(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, now I want to use all this knowledge to plot a Polynomial Function or graph a
Polynomial Function.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:19)
So, let us reiterate what are the things that we have seen. For graphing the polynomial
function, one way is to find the tabular form and try to graph it as in a crude manner. More
knowledgeable way is, you follow this algorithm that is find x intercept, y intercept if
possible because it may happen that they do not have any real roots and you may not be
able to get x-intercept, all the x-intercepts right.
Then for graphing it is helpful to check the symmetry that is; if 
) and 
) are same
if it is an even degree polynomial; that means, you have symmetry about y axis. If it is an
odd function you can check whether they are symmetric about origin that is 
). Typical case is the first symmetry is 
 2 , it is an even degree polynomial and
it is symmetric. So, once you have drawn here for 
 you have to just keep the mirror
image.
That is how it helps in graphing. In a similar manner a 
 3 is a odd degree polynomial
and 
) = 
). Therefore, whatever you got about origin if you reflect about origin
then you will be able to retain the same shape; you do not have to compute explicitly. This
is the way this checking of symmetry helps.
Next identify the zeros; x intercepts we have already identified. So, you have identified
the zeros. Then you identify their multiplicities. If you identify the multiplicities of the
polynomials you know the behavior of the polynomials at x intercept. You just recollect;
multiplicity the sum of the multiplicities of all zeros cannot exceed the degree of the
polynomial that you have to keep in mind. After identifying the multiplicity you know the
behavior at the zeros of the polynomial function.
Now, you want to know the behavior beyond zeros of the polynomial function that is; the
end behavior. So, end behavior you can use the leading term and you can identify the
behavior. Remember the table that we have shown for identifying the end behavior.
And finally, you use the end behavior the behavior at intercepts to sketch the graph.
Turning points - the number of turning points can be identified we may not be able to
locate exactly where the turning point is. For that, you need the tools of calculus to identify
the exact location of a turning point.
And when you identify those when you roughly estimate the turning points; kindly ensure
that the number of turning points do not exceed one less than the degree of the polynomial.
So, if the degree of the polynomial is 
, the number of turning point should not exceed n
 1 ok. And finally, you can use technology to sketch the graph. So, use graphing tools
like Desmos or some other tools for graphing the function ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:07)
So, let us see this in action. So, here is an example I want to sketch a graph of this
polynomial function; 
 + 2)2 (
 5). Obviously, I have figured out oh it is a
 + 2)2 . So, the first thing that we; so, I want to graph this function. So, the first thing
that I want to find is the x intercept, because it is given in factored form it is no brainer;
 2 which is this point 
 2 and then (
 5). So, 
 = 5 which is this point.
These two are the zeros of the polynomial functions; 
 2 has multiplicity 2 and it is
an even degree polynomial. So, over here the behavior of function I am trying to sketch it
will come from here, it will go from here. So, I know the behavior of the function is of this
form, it will just pass through the axis.
And 
5 I do not know the exact values, but roughly it will be more of the linear form
and it will pass through the point 
 5, then it will come down over here and then it will
pass through this point. So, up to this I am ok. Now, you look at this polynomial if you
look at this polynomial, then the polynomial will be a cubic polynomial; it will have a
negative term.
So, essentially 
3 < 0 ok. So, the end behavior of this polynomial because 
3 < 0 as 
 this function will tend to infinity. Yes, and as 
 the function will naturally go up
like this.
So, this is the vague understanding of the behavior. If I want to get more precise on what
values this is roughly the shape of the function. If I want to get more precise on what values
the function takes, I can consider the y intercept as well that is I will put 
 = 0. So, it
will be 22 4 22 4 yes, and into 
 5 that will give me 
 20 + 20. So, this intercept that I
have drawn is wrong. It should be somewhere here + 20. So, let me erase this and redraw
the function again.
Let us take the eraser. So, it may not go this high as well. So, over here the font behavior
of the function ok; so, let me again go back to the marker. And the function may cut here
itself pass through this point and join this point. Yes, so, this bulge will not be there
because this function is linear over here. It may be of this form. So, let me again erase this
part yeah.
So, let us see. So, we have identified the end behavior ok, final check that number of
turning points. The function is cubic, so it can have at most two turning points, there are
only two turning points: one is here, one is here fine. So, let us see whether whatever we
have said is correct or not. So, let me hide this first.
So, x intercept is -2 and 5, no problem. 
 2 has multiplicity 2. So, the quadratic
behavior should be plotted there. Yes, 
 = 5 has multiplicity 1. So, a linear behavior is
plotted here assume this is a line. So, linear behavior is a plot must be plotted here. And,
then 
) intercept 
(0) is 20 which we corrected we were not correct in the initial stages
and the leading term is 
 3 .
So, therefore, the odd degree polynomial with negative leading coefficient has the
following end behavior; as 
, this is the behavior that we have plotted;
, this is also correct. And 
 can have at most 3 
 1 = 2 turning points,
this is the behavior right.
So, now, I was roughly ok in drawing the graph of a function. This is because I do not
exactly know the behavior of the turning points. So, I will be roughly ok in drawing the
graph of a function, but not exactly. If you want to be more precise you can actually
tabulate the values around some critical points and then you can figure out. This is when
the formula is given to you.
Now, the question can be asked that what if the formula is not given to you, but you have
been given only a function. And from the graph you need to identify the polynomial.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:17)
In such cases one theorem which will help you a lot, I will not use this theorem in a rigorous
manner. But it will help you a lot, is intermediate value theorem because we are dealing
with continuous functions. This intermediate value theorem is valid for all continuous
functions.
What this theorem says is, a polynomial function is a continuous function. So, let 
 be a
polynomial
function,
then
intermediate
value
theorem
states
that;
) have opposite signs; that means. So, let us say 
) > 0, and 
) < 0
and 
, then there exist at least one c between a and b such that 
) = 0; that is
essentially the meaning.
For example, I have this coordinate plane my value of 
) is here, and 
) is here, and
the function that is given to me is a continuous function right. So, finally, it has to pass
through the x axis to reach the value here right. So, in such cases we will say that; this is
the 0 of the polynomial that is what we are calling as c, 
So, you using this you when you are actually having trouble in finding the zeros of the
function, you can actually evaluate two values any two values of opposite signs. And if
you evaluate any two values of opposite signs, then you know that there is some root some
0 in between that will improve that you will gain a confidence by doing these things.
So, this is an important theorem in mathematics, intermediate value theorem. You can use
this to find the roots of the polynomial when you are having difficulty in identifying the
roots of the polynomial. So, you simply put 
) and 
) if they have opposite sign, then
there is at least one root in between; that is the meaning. You can use this theorem to your
advantage.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:37)
So, using this theorem we can actually derive a formula for polynomial function. You use
this theorem to identify the zeros; rest of the methodology is similar. So, how to derive a
formula for polynomial functions? So, given a graph of a polynomial, how to find with in
coordinate axis? You have all the numbers attached to it, then the question can be asked
as to how to find the polynomial function the algebraic expression of a polynomial
function?
So, in that case our modus operandi is similar to what we have done. Find the x-intercepts
from the graph. Find the factors of the polynomial, this we already know. Understand the
behavior of x intercepts around x intercepts to get more understanding of the x intercepts
that is zeros of the polynomial about their multiplicities.
So, you will find multiplicity of each factor. Once you have gained understanding identify
the end behavior that also you have to do. Next, after doing that you find the least degree
polynomial containing these factors. What are the factors? Those are x intercepts that you
have figured out. You have also seen the end behavior, so the least degree polynomial
which will give you that particular function behavior.
Once the least degree polynomial is figured out you use any point on the graph that is why
the coordinate axis is important, the numbers are important. You use any point on the
graph, in particular y intercept is the easiest and in that case you can determine the stretch
factor.
The stretch factor over here is the unknown a that I have told you while figuring out the
factors in one of the examples. So, that is the stretch factor. It will be more clear when we
will solve the examples ok. So, this is our recipe for attacking the problem of deriving the
formula given a graph.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:58)
So, let us try to apply this recipe to one example. So, write the formula of a polynomial
given in the graph, the graph is here ok. So, I will go around and try to find the x intercepts
of this graph. So, one x intercept is here which I think is 
 = 1 and other x intercept is -2.
So, 
 2 and 1 are the x intercepts; y intercept over here is
2, 0
 2 is the y intercept. So,
we have identified x and y intercepts.
The graph actually seem to have two turning points. So, the least degree if it has two
turning points the least degree polynomial will be because 
 1 = 2. So, the least degree
polynomial should be cube degree 3 polynomial right ok. And since it is crossing over this
end from end behavior also you will have some understanding that it is yeah, it should be
an odd degree polynomial. So, therefore, the polynomial may be of degree 3, correct.
It should be an odd degree polynomial; it has only two turning points. So, the least degree
of the polynomial is 3. Now what you will do next? Next I want to identify the
multiplicities, that is 
 = 1 it the function more or less seems to be linear and at 
the function more or less seems to be quadratic.
So, it is very easy in this case because, 
 2 is a even degree behavior, x is equal to
because it is bouncing off. So, it is a even degree behavior and 
 = 1 is linear behavior
and the polynomial is of degree 3 or more, but odd degree. So, the first instance is you
guess the function to be of the form (
 + 2)2 (
 1). So, now, I have not yet used the
information that the intercept the y intercept is happening at 
 2, correct.
So, that information I have to use now because that is the function value that I have. These
are the based-on factors we are basically equating to 0 right. So, the a may be missed out.
So, where the non-zero value comes you should be able to figure out. You can you are free
to choose any value, but for me it is better to choose y intercept.
So, y intercept is 
 2, we have already seen that, but if you put what is y intercept? It is
 (0). So, if you put this in the function form the value of 0 in the function form over here
you will get actually this is to be equal to 
. So, if you are getting this to be equal to
, then 
 must be equal to 
 2; that means, 
 = 2 great.
So, if 
 = you substitute this value into the function. So, 
) = (
 + 2)2 (
 1),
fantastic. So, you have you got an algebraic expression. Now, to match this algebraic
expression, you use the technology that is graphing tool to plot the function and you can
verify the result for yourself that yes, this is the function that we have actually plotted ok.
So, this is the complete understanding of two-step mission that is; given an algebraic
expression how to graph the polynomial function. Given the graph of a polynomial
function, how to write an algebraic expression of a polynomial function. This ends our
topic on polynomial functions.
Thank you.
