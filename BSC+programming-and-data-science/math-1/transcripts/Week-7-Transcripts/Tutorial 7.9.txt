For our last question, there is a company and they are making a particular product and the
demand of the particular product is us 
) , the production of the same product is 
) for 12
months, where 
 is the number of months after January and for January we are taking 
 is equal
to 0. And then they have given us 
), as a polynomial and this is essentially a
quadratic multiplied by a monomial by another monomial and another monomial.
So, we have a fifth degree polynomial here 
), then find out which months should
company reduce production after March. So, reduced production would mean 
) is greater,
that means 
) < 0 and we are interested in those situations where this curve is less
than 0 and so we just try to graph this curve and 
 2 + 1 has no real roots.
So, the only roots here are 2 and 5.8 and 11.6, so our curve is going to look something like and
since 
 is positive, then since the coefficient of the highest power is positive we will have this
how polynomial go to 
 as 
 goes to 
 and then we have a situation like this because this odd
polynomial it goes to -
 here and there are only three roots, there is 2 and 5.8 and 11.6.
So, we are looking for when is it negative and that we have to do only in the 0 to 12 range
because we are only looking for months of 1 year, actually even 12 is not correct because we
are starting from 0 we are only going till 11. So, if the root is 11.6 then 11 is somewhere here
and this is a 5.8, 6 is somewhere here and so these are the months where you get negative. Now
six is not June it is actually July because Jan is taken to be 0.
So, we have July and then August is 7, then September would be 8 and October is 9, November
is 10 and December is 11 and all these months you have the function being, the polynomial
being lesser than 0. So, these are the months where they should reduce production and they are
mentioning after March, if we looked at it before March, then you would have also have to
consider January and 0 and 1 which is January and February but since they are specifically
saying after March this is the set of months where the company should reduce production,
thank you.
