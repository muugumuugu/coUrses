In the fourth question, there is some data of a vehicle, and a student fitted a curve for the
vehicle's speed 
. So, this is our variable 
 and its fuel economy mileage in kilometre per litre
). So, it is a function of 
 and this function is given in this way, we are going to use it
for 
 which means if we reduce it to the standard form, we will get 
+ 30. So, we have the situation where a the coefficient of 
 square is
0.025. And 
 is the coefficient of 
 which is
and that is
, which is equal
, therefore 2.2, and lastly,
 = 30.
Now, we may observe that the 
 square coefficient is negative so this is a downturn parabola,
which is why they are asking what is the maximum economy. So, at the vertex, you will get
the maximum fuel economy so we need to find the vertex. And we know that the vertex is at x
is equal to
, which in our case is then
So, if we write it down in fractions, we have 
then 
40 itself, because a is
. This is probably better than in fractions.
and this will be
into
. So, we have the 40 and the 40 cancelling off and minus and
minus become plus 2, and 88 will give us 44. So, we have the vertex that is we get the maximum
fuel economy at a speed of 44 kilometres per hour. And what is the maximum economy at this
particular speed that we can calculate from our equation directly we have 
(44) =
+ 30 so this is 4, 10s a 4, 11s.
This is also 4, 10s and 4, 11s and we get 96.8 
 48.4 + 30, which is then further equal to
96.8 is two times 48.4 so you will get 48.4 + 30 giving us 78.4 kilometre per litre. So, we
can say that this is our maximum fuel economy which is achieved at this particular speed.
