Now, second question we are going to have, this quadratic functions curve touches the X-axis
exactly at 1 point. And for that what is the value of 
 supposed to be? First observation should
be that the vertex is given to us. The vertex, which is
thus the vertex is
, which is
, here 
 = 1, 
6, and 
that is 3. So, this is 1, this is 2 and this is 3, our vertex is on
this particular line that is 
 = 3. And we are told that it touches the X- axis, the parabola
touches the X-axis at precisely 1 point.
We also can see that a is positive, so this is an upward turn parabola, upturned parabola. And
if it touches the X-axis at exactly 1 point that is only possible when the vertex is right here on
the X-axis itself, and from here, our parabola looks something like this. That means, for this
condition to be satisfied at the vertex, 
 = 0 that is 
 (3) = 0. And that is equal to 9 
18 + 
 = 0. This gives us 
 = 9 that is it so 
 = 9. When that happens, our equation is
 + 9 and it has its vertex at (3, 0).
