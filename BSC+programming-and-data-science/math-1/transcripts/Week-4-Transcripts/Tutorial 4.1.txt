Hello mathematics students in this tutorial, we are going to look at problems related to the
topics covered in weak four. And so, these are the topics and we will begin with our first
question.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:26)
Here, we would like the minimum value of y for this particular quadratic function. And first,
let us put down the quadratic function in its standard form, the standard form would be 
. In which case, our particular equation, the one that is given here would give
 = 1, 
 = 1 and 
 = 2. We are looking at the minimum value. Now, because the
 square coefficient a is 1 that is a is greater than 0.
So, our parabola will be in this form, if a were lesser than 0, it would be inverted, it would be
a downturned parabola, but right now it is in this form, and the minimum value is going to
occur at this point, which is the vertex, which we know to be
for this particular equation is
. And the value of y at
So, I can write the minimum is equal to

), which in this case is 
( ). And if I substitute
that, I would get (
 + 2, which is essentially
equal to
. And so, we know our vertex
+ 2, which gives us 2 - , which is
and that is essentially 1.75. So, this point, here it is now we
know it to be (-0.5, 1.75).
Now, they are asking us for the 
- intercept and this is what we need to observe about the
intercept.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:57)
Point (-0.5, 1.75) assuming this is 1 and this is 2, this is -1 of course, so this is negative side
and this is -2. So, -0.5 is going to be somewhere here and on the Y- axis, this would be 1 and
this would be 2, 1.75 is somewhere here so our vertex point is here.
And from here, we know that this is an upward parabola, which is going to be something like
this. And that means it never touches the X- axis at all. There is no 
intercept for this
parabola.
And lastly, it is asked to find the length of the line segment on the straight line passing through
the y- intercept of the given curve and the point (-2, 4). So, (-2, 4) is somewhere over here, and
we need to find this point here the 
intercept. And the 
intercept is easy to obtain, since
our curve is y = 
 + 2. 
 intercept is obtained when the curve cuts the Y- axis that is
when 
 = 0 so 
(0) = 2, therefore, our intercept is actually (0, 2).
And the point we are looking at is (-2, 4) and it is the length of this line segment that we require.
And that line segment we will get by using the Euclidean distance formula, it will be
 0) + (4 
 2) which is essentially 
4 + 4 , that is root 
8, which is 2
2, units.
