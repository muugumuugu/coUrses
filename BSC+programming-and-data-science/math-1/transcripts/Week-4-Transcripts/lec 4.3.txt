Slope of a Quadratic Function
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
So, in this situation, I want to know what is the slope of this curve and is it a constant or which
variable or what else? So, we want to answer this question. So, first, we need to plot this
function, for plotting the function, we know what is the axis of symmetry for this b is 0. So, so
 is the axis of symmetry and it will be symmetric about 
. Minimum value
will be 0 as it can be seen.
So, I will take a symmetry about 
 = 0 that is, I have taken 
1, 0, 1, 2, these are the points
then I have evaluated the ordered pairs, that is 4, 1, 0, 1, 4. The symmetry is clearly visible in
these. Now, what is the definition of slope? It is change in 
 upon change in 
So, if you look at the left-hand side, the first column, the change in 
 is constant. It is 1 all the
time so I will use this notation, and I will go ahead and figure out what is the difference between
 values because the denominator is always 1, it suffices to take the difference between 
values.
So, the first value is 
3, 1 
4 is 
1 . 0 
 1 = 
1, 1 
 0 = 1,4 
 1 = 3, so I got the
changes in 
 with respect to 1 unit change in 
 so this is the slope, but where does this slope
lie or at what point is this slope? Because if it is a straight line, I know the slope is constant.
So, in order to understand this let us go to a figure and try to understand.
This is a curve, 
 2 . Now, when I consider these 2 points 
1 , what I am actually
doing is, I am assuming a straight line connecting these 2 points and I am calculating slope for
it. So, I have assumed all these straight lines and I have calculated the slope for it. Is this a
slope for a curve? No, basically not because it is a slope for that straight line.
So, now how will I identify this slope? So, if at all I want to decide what is the slope of the line
if you look at our old definition the change in 
 by change in 
 also associated with 
, the
 plays a crucial role, what is 
 is the angle of inclination. So, if I consider any point
over here, and if I draw the inclination of, if I draw a line passing through that point and if I
measure the inclination of that point with this positive 
 then I will get a slope because
the definition of 
 was not dependent on the line per se, it was dependent on that line on
that particular inclination.
So, 
 of that is still a slope of a line. So, let us try to use this idea and see what we can get.
So now, I have identified 1 point let us say this point is actually (1.5, 2.25) because I am
considering a curve, which is 
 2 . What will be the slope of a line at this point? We can ask
this question but if you look at this line, this vertical line, this vertical line and if I slide this
vertical line slightly for this point, then this is nothing but a tangent to this curve, it passes
through it only once.
Let us try to actually plot that line. Yes so, once we have plotted this line, this is the tangent to
that curve and the line is actually parallel to this line and the point is 1.5. This gives me a hint
that this is something like you have 
3, the point is, you have a slope between these 2 points
as 3, you have a point which is 1.5 and if I divide this point, this particular difference by that
point I am getting 2. Then let us look at these differences, what are these differences, the
difference is 
3) = 2,1 
1) = 2 so, all these differences are 2.
If you look at the second differences of these points, there are 2 that means there is some
relation, 3 and 1.5, 1.5 times 2 is 3. So, I can safely assume that this point 1.5 is actually a
midpoint of 1 and 2 on the 
 and therefore, whatever value is given to it is actually the
value of the slope of a curve. And in particular, if I go here, for example, if I go here, and if I
talk about the point 0 and 1, then what I will get is a point 0.5, the midpoint of this. Again, I
can do a similar exercise, I can draw a line and the line again will be parallel to this line and at
a point 0.5, I will get the line with a slope 1.
In a similar manner if I go here, I will get a line with a slope 
1, in a similar manner here, I
will get a line with a slope 
 3 and therefore, I can safely conclude that the slope of this
particular curve is 2
. How? I have computed it. So, let us now verify our hypothesis. So, let
us take a point 0, consider any 2 points about 0, let us take symmetric points because I need a
symmetry.
So, let us take the point (1, -1), what is the slope of this line? It is horizontal line, so the slope
should be 0 and that is what this slope is. So, in particular, I can verify for all points if I consider
a point, let us say a, a is used here. Let us say if I consider a point z then I will go z +u, z
u, I
will consider those 2 things and I will assume their values, draw a straight line joining them
and whatever is the value of the slope for that straight line will be the value of slope for my
point. This is a beautiful idea that can be generalized to a general quadratic curve.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:33)
So, let us answer the general question that is, I want to find a slope of a quadratic function
 2 +
 2 + 
 where 
 0. So, we will simply take 5 set of points, standard 5 set of points,
1, 0, 1, 2, I will just substitute these values in the function. So, I will get a corresponding
values of 
, which are here, 4
 , and
 . I will take the first
differences of these two, those are given here and then I will take one more difference of these
two, all these differences will turn out to be 2
Now, if I look at the points which are here, and if I consider the midpoint of this midpoint of
these 2 that is 1.5 so
 1.5 + 
 will give me the answer to my question that what is the
slope of that particular value, because if you look at this 
3 is actually 2 times 1.5. This
1 is actually 2 times 
0.5, 1 is 2 times 0.5, 3 is again 2 times 1.5 so I am essentially getting
the slope of all these values that means, my answer to the question that the slope of this curve
quadratic function is 2
Now, from the table it is very clear the 2 way comes here,
 I have derived it because this
is a value containing 1.5 in the middle, so this is 2 times 1.5 So, that is 
 so 2
 that is what
this is 2
. Now, we can do some interesting observations, we have already seen around
point 0 for 
 2 , the slope was flat it was 0. So, when will that happen? Right.
So, you can equate this 2
 = 0, slope 0 means the function has reached its minimum or
maximum, slope is 0. So, when will that happen? That is 
. This is one of the reasons
why 
 is the value of the minimum or maximum, because the slope reaches the value 0.
So, here what actually slope, calculates?
Slope actually calculate the rate of change with respect to 
 and a rate of change of 
 with
respect to change in 
. So, if the rate of change is becoming 0, that means the function has
reached its minimum or maximum. So, this justifies the idea that why a quadratic function
should have a minimum or maximum value at the point
Still, that point is pending where we want to find why the axis of symmetry is 
 and we
will come to it later. But as you can see here, the slope of a quadratic function is significantly
different from slope of a line, slope of a line is constant, whereas the slope of a function
quadratic function 
 is no longer a constant. In fact, it is variable that is 2
. It depends
and 
, not on the constant 
 , which is expected.
