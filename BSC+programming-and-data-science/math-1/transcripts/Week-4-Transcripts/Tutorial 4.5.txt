Our fifth problem looks a little complicated, but let us go one by one. And here we have the
production rate of a material which is being made in a factory depends and it two factors 
1 and
2 as 
2 . And these two factors, they are the functions of the purity of the raw material.
And that variable is 
 is the purity of the raw material. And both these functions are given
to be linear 
) = 
) = 
. And it is given that 
 are all positive.
And it is asked find the purity of material, that is the value of 
 for which the production is
maximum. So, let us understand what is being done here. We have two linear functions and the
rate of production 
2 , which will then 
 = (
) = 
 2 + 
 2 + (
We are told that 
 are all positive, and that indicates the coefficient of 
 2 is negative
because the negative of 
 and that means this is a quadratic function whose parabola is
downturned, therefore, we will be able to get a maximum value at some point and this is going
to be at the vertex, we know that this is going to be at the vertex. So, the vertex is at
because here we have 
 already.
, that is
Let us write it down more carefully, that is the 2(
 2 ) = 
, is where
we will get the vertex. And since we know that the maximum is going to occur at this particular
, we get the
