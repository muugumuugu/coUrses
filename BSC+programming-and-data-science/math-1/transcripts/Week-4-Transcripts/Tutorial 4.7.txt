In question number 7, we have one relation given this way, y2 = 4ax. And they are asking a
very simple question, is y a function of x. So, we have y2 = 4ax. And the interesting thing
about square roots is, if I did the square root of 1, it is not just 1, it is actually 
1. So, both
(+1) = 1, which is also equal (
1) .
So in this case, we need to consider the fact that y =
. Which means for the same x, I
might have 2 different y's. So, put it this way, I am basically saying f(x) assuming it is a
function is equal to 
 and f(x) is also equal to the 
. And this is not allowed, for a
single element in the domain, for a function, you should have only one image in the range.
But here we have 2 different images for the same element in the domain. Therefore, this is
not a function.

If we looked at it in terms of the plot, we have y2 = 4ax, that is what we are trying to plot.
And for x = 0, we get y = 0. So, this curve passes through the origin definitely. And for the
next x value, I am going to take a, so therefore, y2 = 4a2, which gives 
. So, if a is
positive, this is (a, 0), then 2a is going to be somewhere here like this, and -2a is going to be
somewhere here like this.
And so, we have a parabola which goes something like this. And if a were to be negative,
then this would have been (a, 0) and we would have a similar parabola in the negative
direction. Either way, it is pretty clear that for a given value, you have two corresponding y
values, for a given value of x you have two corresponding y values and that is not allowed for
a function.
Independently f(x) =
 , which is this part of the curve, that can be treated as a function
and f(x) = 
 , for convenience let us call this as f1 and this is f2. This is also possible to
be treated as a function independently, but their combination which gives us this relation, that
is not a function.
