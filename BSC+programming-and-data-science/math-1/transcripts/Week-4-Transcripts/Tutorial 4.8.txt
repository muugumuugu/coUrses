For our eighth question we have an advertiser who is analyzing the growth of likes for their
new ad on YouTube. She analyzed that the increase in likes in a given second is equal to 4
times 
 , where 
 is the midpoint of the time interval, that is the average time in that time
interval. And so we are given an example to explain what this is. The increase in likes from 3
seconds to 4 seconds. So, from the time 
 = 3 to the time 
 = 4, there is a number of increase
in likes, which is equal to 4 
 3.5 and 3.5 is the midpoint of 3 and 4.
So, one way to write this is, let us look at time 
 seconds and the time 
 + 1 seconds. Then it is
given to us that the likes at time 
 + 1, so, number of likes is a function of time. So, 
 + 1) 
) = 4 
 = 4 
 + 2, this is the difference in the likes from time 
 seconds
 + 1 seconds.
Now, it is further given to us that this particular function is a quadratic function. So, 
 + 1) =
 + 1)2 + 
 + 1) + 
 and 
) = 
 2 + 
. Then 
 + 1) 
) = 
 2 + 2
 2 + 
) = 2

This quantity is basically equal to 2
 + 4. So, we are saying that 2
 = 2
 + 4. Now,
what are we supposed to acknowledge here is that the term with the 
 in it, that is the time
dependent term is going to be same on both sides. Whereas the term which is constant is going
to be same on both sides.
Thus, we are saying 2
 = 4
 and 
 = 2. This gives us 2 times t and t cancelled. So, we
know 
 = 2 and that would imply 
 = 2 
 = 0.

And our question is asking us what is the value of 
. So, we know this is equal to 0. Second
question, the second part of the question is asking what is the total number of likes at the end
of 60 seconds.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:49)
That would be impossible to calculate because we have the values of 
 and 
, so we know that
our 
), in this case we want 
 of 60. 
) = 
 2 + 0
 = 2
 2 + 
. But we do not know
what 
 is. So, 
(60) = 2 
 602 + 
. Now, if we made further interpretations that there were 0
likes at time 
 = 0. So, if 
(0) = 0 then 
 = 0. So, this is a particular assumption we are
making, we are assuming that the timer started when the likes were 0 and that would imply
your 
) = 2
 2 .
(60) = 2 
 60 
 60 = 7200, that is 7200 likes at the end of 1 minute.

And lastly, for Part C, we are being asked the domain of the function is [
), what is the
value of 
. We know that 
) = 2
 2 + 
. Now only real requirement we have is that our likes
be greater than or equal to 0. So, 
 2 + 
 0. Another thing we have is clearly
that 
(0) = 
 0, because at 0 time, it is not like you can have negative likes. So, 
Now we know that 
 0 and now we also found that 
 0. So, 2
 2 + 
 0, which means
any time that is 0 or greater than 0. So, we are looking at the timer being started at a particular
time and from there on, if this is 0 from there on your function is well defined and the number
of likes will be greater than or equal to 0. So, the domain will be all the time from 0 seconds to
