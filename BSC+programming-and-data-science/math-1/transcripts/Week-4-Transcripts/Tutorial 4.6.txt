In our sixth question, we are given this particular quadratic function 
) = 
 2 + 8
 + 6.
And we are told that two points P and Q, which are on this parabola such that they are two units
away from the axis of symmetry. So, let us try to find out what the axis of symmetry is for this
parabola. Our equation is 
) = 
 2 + 8
 + 6. And that would mean, in a standard form
 = 8, and 
 = 6.
And that would give us the vertex is at 
, which in our case will then become 
 = 8, so we will get 4. And the functions value at 4 is 
1 (4) = 
(4)2 + 8 
 4 + 6 = 22. So,
the vertex is (4, 22). Further, we are told that P and Q are two units away from the axis of
symmetry. So, the axis of symmetry is along 
 = 4, which means P and Q will be at 
 = 2 and
 = 6, 4 
 2 and 4 + 2.
So, these points are going to be P(2, 
1 (2)) = (2, 
4 + 16 + 6) = (2, 18). And the point Q
is going to be 
(6, 
1 (6)) and from symmetry we know that this is also going to be 18, so 
18). And it is now told to us that the triangle PVQ is rotated 180 degrees about its axis of
symmetry and we are being asked the curved surface area of the resulting cone. So, let us look
at what this looks like.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:08)
So, now let us suppose that this point here, let us call this our (4, 22), in that case 18 is 4 units
below, so this will be the horizontal line passing through 18 and 2 will be here. So, (2,18) is
here and this gives us (6,18) is here. This is (2,18) and this is (6,18). And that gives us a parabola
which looks something like this, obviously a smoother curve than I have drawn, but something
like this. And the triangle we are interested in is an isosceles triangle, which looks roughly like
this.
This is the triangle that is being rotated 180 degrees about its axis of symmetry and its axis of
symmetry is 
 = 4. I am erasing the parabola in order to focus on the triangle alone. If this
triangle were to be rotated, this point which is our P, this is our Q, this point P basically goes
around and reaches Q, whereas Q comes around and reaches P. And in this way, we have a
cone in our hands and we want the curved surface area and that would be this region and the
base circle is this flat surface below this is the base circle.
And we are interested in the curved region whose surface area is given to be 
. So, what is
 is the radius of the base circle. Which is basically then this quantity, this is 
, which we
can tell is 4 
 2, so it is 2. And what is 
 over here, that is the slant height, which is basically
this height, that height can be obtained as the hypotenuse of this base radius and height here,
which is as we can see 4 units. So, 
22 + 42 = 
20 = 2
So, we have 
 = 2 and 
 = 2
5, this gives us a curved surface area is 
5 = 4
square units.

For the part B of our question we have another curve which is also quadratic and whose roots
are basically 4 repeated. So, 
) = (
 4)(
 4). So, x being equal to 4 makes 
2 (4) =0.
So, therefore, our root is 4 and it is repeated because coming twice here. So, let us now try to
look at what they are asking. Now, let A be the set of all points inside the region bounded by
these curves, including the curves. So, we are saying the region bounded by these curves and
including the curves.
And they would like the range of y coordinates of points in it. We know already that (4, 22) is
the vertex for our previous parabola. And it also passed through (2, 18) and (6, 18). And about
this new parabola, the 
), we know that 4 is repeated root so there is only 1 root and
therefore, at 4, that is 22, this would be 21, this is 20, this is 19, 18 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 1, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. So, this is going to be the repeated root and the vertex of our
other parabola.
So, if one parabola is like this, 
1 had negative 
 2 coefficient so it is a downturned parabola,
then the other parabola 
) = (
 4)2 is an upturned parabola which is going to be
something like this. So, these curves are going to intersect in some way this way. And we are
interested in the range of 
. So that would be, what are all the 
 possible in this region.
So, if this is the region we are looking at, then clearly this is the upper bound of our 
 and this is a lower bound. So, 
 in our region range between 0
and 22. And they said including the curve, so 0 is also included, 22 is also included, so we can
write the same thing as 
 [0, 22].
