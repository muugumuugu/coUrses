There are 6 flat, 6 of them, thick iron sheets each of length, breath and thickness 
 + 4, 
3 and 
 respectively and they are melted to make solid boxes of dimensions 2,
. How
many solid boxes can be made this way? So, basically the volume will have to be equal. So,
first we find the volume of our 6 sheets put together that would be 6 [(
 + 4) 
3 ) 
] and this would be equal to the volume of the solid boxes.
So, let us say there are 
 solid boxes and then the volume of each is 2,
. So, now
this 
 and this 
 cancels and this 
 + 4 and this numerator here cancels and 2
 + 6 is (
 2 so, this is one time and this is 2 times. So, what we get is 6 = 2
5. So, 2 and 2 also
cancels. This implies 
 = 6 
 5 and that is 90. So, you get 90 boxes overall.
