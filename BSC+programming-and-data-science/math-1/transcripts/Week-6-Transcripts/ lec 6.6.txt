Division Algorithm
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, let us go to the next slide and emphasize the algorithm that we have derived just now.
In order to understand the algorithm, you need some terminology. For example, this
is called the divident; the
p(x)
q ( x) is called the divisor. The term that you get
over here, here is called the term that you get over here is called the quotient. And the
that you have got is called the remainder.
Remember you will declare something as a reminder only when the degree of the
denominator is higher than the degree of the numerator, this is the strategy that we will
follow.
So, now, you are very clear about the terminology, the numerator is the divident, the
denominator is the divisor, the term the polynomial term that you get after dividing is
called the quotient, and the rational and the remainder is something that where the degree
of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator.
This is also called a rational function. If you look at polynomial as a function, then
division of two polynomials is a rational function, only condition that we are enforcing is
q ( x)
cannot be equal to 0, this is the condition is which is always in place. Let me
eliminate this and let us go and study the algorithm.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:56)
So, for division of polynomials, we will use the following division algorithm which we
have derived just now, where in the first step what we will do is we will arrange the
terms in the descending order of the degree, and add the missing exponent with 0 as a
coefficient.
Then after adding the missing 0, 0 as a coefficient after adding the missing exponents,
next what we will do is, we will take the first leading terms or the leading monomials,
and we will divide the dividents monomial, the leading monomial of the divident and the
leading monomial of the divisor together. And we will get some number which is which
we will call as quotient, temporary quotient and that quotient we will multiply with our
divident.
Once we multiply with our divident, what we will actually do is we will subtract that
from the original expression for the polynomial that is our numerator. Whatever is
remaining, we will treat that as the next divident. Once we treat that divident, then we
will check if the degree of that new divident is higher than the degree of the denominator
or divisor. If yes, then we will continue with the procedure; if no, we will terminate the
procedure; this is how we will give the division algorithm.
Let us understand this division algorithm by using one example. So, here is an example.
This is the numerator 2 x 3 +3 x 2+1
divided by 2 x +1 , and I want to find the answer
to this question. Let us figure out how to find the answer.
So, in the earlier quest, what I did is I have used the standard numerator denominator.
Now, there is a popular method for division of the polynomial which is called long
division, which works in a similar manner and the same division algorithm works, but
you will have a better handle over the terms.
So, in this long division, what you will do is you will put a parenthesis over here, and
you will put
2 x +1
outside the parenthesis, and you will put this term that is
2 x 3 +3 x 2 . Now, remember the first step plus
0 x+1
ok. So, this is how we will
write. Now, according to our standard terminology, what we will do is we will take the
leading terms
2 x 3.
So, somewhere in the rough you do that. What is
divided by 2 x ? This will give you
So, you write
with
over here, multiply x 2
with 2 x +1
. Once you multiply
2 x +1 , write that term over here, 2 x 3 + x 2 . Now, according to our algorithm
divide the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor and get the monomial
that monomial is
x 2 over here. Next step, multiply the monomial with the divisor and
subtract the result from the divident. So, this is the result from the divident, result from
multiplication, and you are subtracting it from the divident.
So, this will cancel off. So, this will give me 0 and
3 x2 
will give me
2 x +0 x +1 . This is the result ok. So, now, this result, I will check whether the degree
of this result this polynomial that I have obtained is greater or smaller than this ok, that is
what we will do. Check if the resultant polynomial has a degree less than the divisor that
is not true.
So, we will go to step 2. What is the step 2? Which is this, divide the first term, first term
of this divident with this that is you will divide
2 x2
. So, what you will get here is
x . So, you will simply add
over here. And then you will multiply that
with
2 x +1 . Once you do that, you will get 2 x 2 + x . So, you write here 2 x 2 + x .
Then what is the next step? You subtract it from the result, so minus, minus
vanishes, this gives me
x+ 1 , ok. So,
2 x2
x+ 1 , again I will go to the same step
because this degree is same, it is not less than the degree of the denominator.
So, I will again follow the same procedure;
naturally I will add
over here. And once I add
over here, when I multiply
with 2 x +1 , what I will get here is x+ . So, I will write that
But remember over here the thing was
should have multiplied -1 to the
you will multiply
that means,
. So, the answer is
this will not be plus this will be
which will be given a negative sign. So, this will be
x . So, I should what I should have done is I
over here, so 
the answer to be equal to
. So,
which will give me
ok. So, the answer is
, and
, so
. So, I will get
So, what is what will be the resultant answer? This should not be plus, 1 minute, let me
make it very clear. This cannot be plus; this should be minus, because I have to multiply
with
. And here it is the remainder is
and the as a quotient, and the remainder is
. So, what I got here is
x + x
(Refer Slide Time: 09:23)
So, let me rewrite it again that is I got
x 2+ x
, this is what I got. Let me
2 2 x+ 1
verify this result. And we have demonstrated the algorithm, yes,
this is how we will consider division of polynomials in general.
