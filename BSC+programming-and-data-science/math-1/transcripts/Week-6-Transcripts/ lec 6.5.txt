Algebra of polynomials: Division
(Refer Slide Time: 00:15)
In this video, let us have look at Division of polynomials. What is a division of
polynomial? We have already familiar with division of polynomials, but we have not
done in a rigorous manner and we do not know all possible cases that can occur while
considering division of polynomials, that is why it is important to look at division of
polynomials.
We know some cases like for example, if I have been given a polynomial say
a2 x + a1 x +a 0
and if I am told that if this polynomial is divided by a constant say
c . Then, I know what is the resultant polynomial. It will be
a2 x a 1 x a 0
that
will be the polynomial. So, this case, we are already familiar with.
Now, let us go to one more level of extension. Suppose, this polynomial is divided by a
monomial; that means, we are considering a division of a polynomial by a monomial.
Monomial means, the polynomial that contains only one term, only one variable term.
3 x +4 x +3
So, in that case, let us take this example. So,
, ok.
So, notice few factors here. In this case, when I am considering a division of two
polynomials, the numerator and the denominator; the denominator should always have a
degree smaller than the degree of the numerator. If it is not the case, let us say the
numerator has degree
m and the denominator has degree
is the degree of the numerator
n , then what I am saying
should always be greater than or equal to
n . If it
is not the case, then the division is not possible ok.
For example, let us consider one case, where I am considering a constant polynomial let
us say 4 and I am dividing it by some polynomial which is
2 x +1 . Here, I cannot
divide this; I cannot divide by this polynomial because there is no corresponding
term. Here it is
x0 .
So, I cannot divide this polynomial because the degree of the polynomial plays a crucial
role. So, in this case, the division is not possible, I have to keep this function as it is. Let
us keep this point in our mind and consider division of polynomials. So, now, I am
dividing a polynomial with a monomial, how will you handle this?
(Refer Slide Time: 03:09)
So, a monomial is simply
here. So, what I will do is I will split this with this
addition sign, I will split each of them in separate terms. So, I will consider the term
3 x2
that will give me a term, when I consider this term it will give me a term
When I consider
3x .
, I will get a term 4.
Now, as I mentioned earlier when I consider the term
, the degree of 3 is a constant
because 3 is a constant polynomial the degree is 0. So, I cannot divide this polynomial.
So, this will automatically influence this decision that it will remain as it is, that is
So, these are some key things while dividing polynomial by a monomial.
Now, the key idea is I want to divide a polynomial with another polynomial. Let me
erase this first. So, now, I want to divide a polynomial with another polynomial. So, how
will I go about this?
That is I want to find something of this sort. Let us address this question in a video ok.
So, apparently, I do not have any practical way to divide this right now; but from
whatever theory I learnt about quadratic functions, can I derive something? That is what
the question is. So, we will try to figure out some more methods in this video.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:51)
So, let us continue and take a question, this is the numerator that is given to me divided
by another polynomial which is x+ 1
and I want to figure out what this will be equal
to? Let me take this polynomial over here and try to figure out what this polynomial will
be equal to. So, now, I have 3 x2 + 4 x+ 1
and it is divided by
x+ 1 . Now, if I want
to divide the numerator by the denominator, what I should see is ok, the denominator has
the highest degree which is
x . The numerator has highest degree which is x 2
now, how will I be able to get rid of the denominator for some at least for some terms?
So, in that quest, what I will see is I will simply take the first term over here and the first
term over here and I will see like monomial, I will see what is
easily because both are monomials. So,
. This I can do very
vanishes with this square and I will I am
3 x . So, next thing that I will do is I will consider
left with
3 x( x+1) . So, this
actually gives me the answer 3 x2 +3 x . Now, I will try to figure out this term in the
expression that is given in the numerator.
So, if I want to figure out the expression that is given in the numerator, I can easily split
this 4 x
as 3 x+ x . If I can do so, that means, I can take this term and based on this
logic, I can actually write this as
3 x 2 +3 x+ x +1
x +1
Now, I can intelligently split the term over here and I can divide this and I can take this
as a separate term and divide this. So, now, you can readily see the answer will be here,
3 x( x+1)
that will get cancel off with
x+ 1
and over here, it will be 1. So, the
answer is 3 x+1 . Therefore, such a division is possible, ok.
Let us verify whether the answer is 3 x+1 ; yes. So, I have demonstrated you how to
divide a polynomial using simple method by the method of factorization that we have
already used. Now, this is because
What if
x+ 1 was the factor of 3 x2 + 4 x+ 1 .
x+ 1 is not a factor of 3 x2 + 4 x+1 , what would have happened? Let us use
this example to understand our findings. So, let me take a eraser and let me write that this
instead of 1, let me put ok, let all other things remain constant, what makes it a factor;
that x+ 1 .
So, I will simply what I will simply do is I will simply change the term to 4 ok. Now,
x+ 1 is no longer a factor, still I will continue with the same method, I will take this
3x by x. So, I can consider this
In that case, what happens is
rewrite this as
3 x+
1( x +1+3)
x +1
1(x +1)+3
x+ 1
x +3 x , only difference is this will be
3 x +3 x . So, that will give me
x+ 4 .
into let me
. So, that again gives me an edge that is this is nothing but
getting cancelled.
So, this will remain as
. So, this is how even if it is not a factor, I can divide the
x +1
polynomial. Now, as we have started by giving some for addition, multiplication,
subtraction, we have given some algorithms. So, now, we need to identify such algorithm
for division of polynomials. To do that, let us first solve this complicated problem in this
simple manner and try to derive an algorithm and try to derive an algorithm for by
solving this problem.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:15)
problem
want
divide
p(x)=x 4 +2 x 2 +3 x+ 2 by q ( x)=x 2 + x+ 1
degree 4; q (x)
terms
. So, the
divide
p(x)
polynomial
is a polynomial of
is a polynomial of degree 2. So, how will I go about this? So, again, I
will apply a strain strategy that is I will start by writing
directly goes to
2 x2
. So, but I want the term containing
0 x +2 x + 3 x +2 and this term is divided by
plus remember here, it
also to be present
x + x +1 .
So, remember our first step in the last example was first you take the first term over here
and take the first term over here. Then, take a consider a division of these monomials.
This will give me
. So, what I will do now is, I will consider
will give me actually
x +x + x
x ( x + x +1) . This
Now, as per our earlier strategy while solving this problem, we have adopted a strategy
that I will add these terms over here. So, if I add these terms over here, then I will
subtract appropriate terms over here. So, in this case, x 4
not there and here,
is there.
So, I need to subtract that
is already there,
from this expression and then, I need to subtract from
, I will split this into two. So, let us rewrite this expression, that is the numerator
of this expression, x 4 is already there. In order to cancel the denominator, I need
over here.
So, I need to add
x +x
ok; but this
was not present here, it was
. So,
x 3 from here. So, that it will retain a legacy
naturally the next step will be to eliminate
of this term. So, if I have eliminated
, then it is
taken out, so this will be another
x 2+3 x +2 as it is.
So, let me write that term as it is
3 x+2
of which
and now, if I divide this term by
, I have
x 2+ x +1 ,
then what I will get here is take these first three terms and keep the remaining term as it
is ok. So, if I do that, then what will happen is this term
x 2 will come out as common
plus now, what happens?
This term vanishes, this term vanishes, this term because
from these three terms, I can take out
x 2 , I can take out common;
common that is what I have written and it
cancels with the denominator. So, whatever is remaining are the remaining term that is
x + x +3 x+ 2
and this thing is divided by x 2+ x +1 .
Now, is our division over? No, because the numerator over here has a higher degree than
the denominator. Therefore, our division is not over. So, again, I will follow a similar
step, I will simply change the color so that I will have a better view ok. So, let us change
the color and have a better view of this.
So, let me write it here from this; from this step, I can go here and say ok. So, this is in
fact, equal to
plus now you look at this term
which will give you
x 2 . So, you divide
x . So, in this case, you will multiply
x ( x 2+ x +1) .
So, if you multiply
x ( x + x +1) , what you will get over here is
x , this
is what you will get. So, you write this term as it is, that is 
Now, from this term, you adjust the terms. So,
to compensate for this term. But there is a plus
there is a
. So, that will give me plus
is already there, so I do not have
, there is a plus
and here
because I am compensating for this
extra 
x 2 added in this term, then there is a 
x and over here it is plus 3 x .
So, I have to add one
for this 
x . So, that will give me plus 4 x
plus and there
x + x +1 . Now, you can take out
common and this will cancel off, this term will cancel off with this term by taking
is no competition for a constant term upon
common. So, it is
2 x +4 x+2
upon
is in common plus what you are left with here is
ok. Again, you will apply a similar procedure that is
x + x +1
you will actually divide
2 x2
. So, you will get 2. So, essentially what you; so, when
you do that, when you divide
, you will get 2.
So, when you will multiply this number by 2, let me write it here that is
ok. So, in this case, what you will get is
there. So, I will continue over here itself
(2 x +2 x+ 2)
x+ 2 x
2(x + x+1)
of which 2 x 2
is already
is already there, 2 x 2 . So, let it
be 2 x 2 +2 x , over here there is plus 4 x . So, I can split
over here plus 2 x
plus 2. So, that will again come plus 2 as it is here. So, what is remaining now is 2 x
upon
x 2+ x +1 .
So, now if you look at this term, what you will get is you can take out 2 common and this
will cancel off with this denominator and therefore, the final expression, I am running
short of space. So, let me erase some terms over here. Let me erase some terms over here
so that I will get some space.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:43)
So, you can rewrite this as to be equal to
x+ 2+
. This will be the final
x + x+1
answer to this division ok. So, this is how we can actually do a division of two
polynomials ok. Let us remove this and see whether to verify whether we have got the
final answer to be correct or not. So, I have removed it, you must have noted the answer.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:21)
And the final answer that we have got here is
x+ 2+
;q( x )=x + x+1 . Yes,
q (x)
so I have got the correct answer. So, here while doing this, we have derived one
algorithm which we will emphasize in the next slide.
