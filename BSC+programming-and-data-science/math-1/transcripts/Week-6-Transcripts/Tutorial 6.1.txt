Hello, mathematics students. In this week's tutorials, we will look at some questions based on
polynomials and the algebra of polynomials. In this question, we have two quadratic equations,
which are 
) and 
), presumably equal to 0, and they have the roots, 
1 + 1, 
 5 + 5
respectively. Then the degree of the polynomial 
) is three, it is not because you have
two quadratic equations, and you are multiplying them.
So, the 
 2 terms will have to necessarily multiply, so (
 2 + 
1 ) 
 2 + 
2 ),
when you multiply these, this term, and this term will have to be multiplied and you are going to
get (
 4 ), so the degree has to be 4, which is this. So, B is correct. And then we have the sum,
is equal to, so we need to find the respective quadratic equations now for this, so this would be
 + 1) 
 1), the other would be (
 + 5) 
 6).
So, this gives us this is, 
 1. And this is essentially 
 30. So, when we add these two,
we get 
) + 
) = 2
 31. So, C is correct, and that would imply D is wrong. And now
we are looking at the difference 
) and that would give us 
 30) =x
square minus 1 minus of x square minus x minus 30, which is 
 2 + 
 + 30. So, 
cancel off and you have 
 + 29. So, E is wrong and F would be correct.
