Our last question we are looking at the best fit for some data. So, this is the fit we have obtained a
fifth degree polynomial for this data, these 4 points and they are asking what is the value of c, c is
the constant term here. What is the value of c if this curve has to be the best fit using sum squared
error? So, let us assume this curve is 
) = 2
. So, we are going to have to
also put up the 
) value, so 
(0) is then c because everything else is power of 
, so 
(0)=c, and
then we have to look at 
(1) which is 2 
 3 + 
 that is equal to 
So, here this is 
 5 and then 
(2) is 2 
 32 
 16 
 6 + 
, now 2 
 32 is 64, 4 
 16 is
64, so these two cancel off, so you get 6 
 6. And lastly, we have 
(3) which is 2 
 243 
 81 
 3 + 
 so that gives us 
 + 153, so here it will be 
 + 153. So, for finding SSE we
are going to have to do 
) or (
))2.
So, (
 ))2 and we are going to sum it from 
 = 1 to 4 and that gives us (
 0)2 +
 1)2 + (
 1)2 + (
 + 1)2 + (
 + 2)2 So, this is the sum squared error.

And we get 
 2 + 
 2 + 1 
 2 + 1 + 2
 2 + 4 + 4
, so this 
 and this + 2 
 cancels
off and we arrive at 4
 2 + 4
 + 5, this is our sum squared error it is a quadratic in c and for
minimum and this is also an upward facing quadratic because the coefficient of 
 2 > 0, so it will
be a parabola like this and the minimum occurs at this point which is the vertex of the parabola
and that we know is 2
 , here 
4 and 
 = 4 so 2
 = 8 so you get
the minimum sum squared error. Thank you.
, so for 
, we get
