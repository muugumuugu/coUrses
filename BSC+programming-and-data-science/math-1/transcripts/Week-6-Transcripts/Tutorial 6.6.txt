In this question, let 
 be the number of years since the year 2000, so 
 = 0 denotes the year
2000. And the total amount generated in lakhs by selling a product is given by 
). So, this
is a polynomial which has the variable as a number of years since 2000, and the different cost
of the particular years are given here. So, purchase cost is this polynomial, transportation cost
is this polynomial, miscellaneous cost is this polynomial.
So, we now have to find out the profit for that year. So, that would just be 
) minus all these
cost. So, it is 5
 4 + 3
 3 + 
 2 + 
 4 + 
 3 + 
 2 ) 
 3 + 
 2 + 
 (0.5
 2 + 0.5
). So,
this would be the total profit and for that we now have to look at the each x power term.
So, 
 4 , there are 2 terms, 5
 4 and 
 4 . So, we get 4
 4 and 
 3 there are 3 terms, 3
 3 , and 
and 
 3 here. So, we get 
 3 and 
 2 x square terms there are 4, there is this 
 2 and then there
is this 
 2 and another 
 2 and minus 
 2 .
So, that will give us minus 1.5 x square because this and this cancels off and then we get
 2 . And lastly the 
 term there is 
 and 
 which cancels off and 
0.5 
. So, 
0.5 
So, this would be the total profit for that year.
