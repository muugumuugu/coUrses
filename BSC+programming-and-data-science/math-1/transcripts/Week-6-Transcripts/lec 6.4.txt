Algebra of polynomials: Multiplication
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
In this video, we will learn how to multiply two polynomials. Let us start with basics of
multiplication of polynomials. We already know how to multiply two binomials. For
example, if you have been given two binomials of the form 
, then you
know how to multiply these two binomials that is we will use the foil method. However,
in this context, we want to generalize the settings for multiplication of polynomials of
arbitrary degree.
So, let us see, let us start with some simple monomials with through examples. So, here is
a polynomial given to you 
) = 
 + 1 and 
 = 2
 . The question is do I know
how to multiply these two polynomials? Remember this one is called monomial, it has
only one term. So, a standard rule of multiplication will mean we have seen this in our
quadratic functions that I will consider the product in this manner.
Once I consider the product in this manner, what we will do is we will try to multiply each
term of this 2
 with each term of this polynomial. So, there are three terms. And for each
term this 2
 will be multiplied. So, if I do that the law of exponents will apply.
For example, 
 will mean 
. So, once I apply we apply the law of exponents and
add the exponents, obviously, 2 was a constant coefficient of 
 which will be multiplied
throughout the expression. And therefore, the resultant is this which we can simplify as
 + 2 
 + 2 
 . This is how we will multiply a monomial.
Now, as you can see the this polynomial has three terms 1, 2 and 3. So, it is not a binomial;
it is a trinomial. So, my foil method will not work here. So, foil method will work only for
these kind of expressions which are binomials. So, let us go ahead and try to consider a
similar expression that is a quadratic expression and another binomial, and try to see how
can I extend the basis of foil method right.
So, here is a binomial 2 
 + 1. And here is a general polynomial quadratic polynomial
which is 
 + 1 same. Now, what will you do? So, naturally you will consider
) which will be written in this form. Now, if I want to extend the basis
whatever I did for monomial, that means, I need to convert this into two monomials.
So, what are those two monomials? One monomial is 2
; another monomial is 1. So, if I
treat them separately that is if I write them in this manner, let me erase this, that is I have
written them in this manner.
Then what can I do about it, that means, now this turned out to be a same expression instead
 , here it is 
 that is all is the difference right. So, whatever I did here, I can do it here.
And the last term is actually multiplied with 1 which it suppressed because multiplication
with 1 will not change anything. So, I do not have to worry about the last term.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:05)
Now, I will multiply this 2
 with all the terms in for of 
) = 
 + 1 which is
similar to this particular thing. So, I will get 2 
 + 1. Now,
the job is very simple.
You can treat this as one polynomial, and this one as a second polynomial, and then we
have to add. How we add polynomials? We will add polynomials by matching the
exponents, matching the exponents of 
. So, if I want to add these two polynomials, what
will I do, I will simply match the exponents and I will add them which is given here.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:02)
So, in this case 2 
 , there is no competing term for 
 . So, it remains 2; 
 comes here
and here, therefore, I added the two which gives me 2+1, in a similar manner the terms
containing x are these two. So, I have added these two, so 2+ 1 
 + 1 which is similar to
what we have seen in the last video of addition of polynomials. And therefore, we get the
answer to be equal to 2
 + 3
 + 3
 + 1.
So, effectively what we have done is we know how to multiply the terms term by term.
And finally, if at all I want to seek an extension of a foil method, it will be a term by term
multiplication of polynomials, that means, you take the polynomial of least degree and
multiply it with the polynomial of highest degree term by term, add those term match the
powers and then write your answer. So, this is one prototype that we can follow for finding
multiplication of polynomials or result of the multiplication of polynomials.
Now, the next question is can I generalize this method or can I answer it programmatically,
that means, can I give a simple formula for what the coefficient of one part 
will be?
For example, in this case can I give a general formula what will be the coefficient of 3
provided I know polynomials 
) and 
). So, to answer that, let us go ahead and try to
find a general formulation of this form of this formula.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:03)
Let us go ahead. And if you are asked given one quadratic polynomial and one linear
polynomial, you are asked to compute 
), how will you go about this? This is
what our task is now. So naturally I will write 
), and then I will convert each
of them into monomials that is one monomial will be 
, and second monomial will be
In this case, what will happen is we will simply multiply them as a separate term by term
multiplication. So, in earlier case our 
 was 1 when we studied one example. But here we
are considering a general expression, and none of the expressions are 0 that is what we are
assuming none of the coefficients at 
 and 
 none of them are 0.
For example, if you consider 
 = 0, then this term itself will vanish the second term itself
will vanish; you will not have the second term. So, we are assuming that all terms remain
in the loop ok. So, now it simple, the job is multiplying these two polynomials, and you
will get some answers that is ok, but now our main worry is to find a pattern in these
answers ok.
So, now, when I multiplied this, if you look at this particular expression that is
 ) + (
 ) . Here you take a pause
and examine the terms. For example, this term contains the coefficient of 
 , this is 2 +
So, 
 . So, in that case, what is happening here is if you look at the suffixes of the
coefficients this is a2, this is 
 , so together they will sum to 3. In a similar manner, you
look at this term which contains 
 . And you look at the suffixes of the coefficients that is
 , together they will sum to the exponent that is a 1+1=2. So, this should be a
coefficient of 
Then if this logic is correct, what should be the coefficient of a constant? The coefficient
of the constant that is 
 . So, the coefficient of the constant must be 
 . In a similar
manner you can ask the question what is a coefficient of 
? If you asked that question, you
will naturally get the answer you collect all the in all the coefficients such that their suffixes
will sum to 1 that is 
 . So, is there anything called 
 ? Yes, it is here.
So, this what we have actually done is we have figured out a pattern; that means, if I want
to find the coefficient of 
 , then better the sum should be some 
, so that they both
will sum, they both will sum to it is not equal to the this is I am saying 
 raise to coefficient
 will be equal to of the will be of the form 
. So, with this understanding, let
us go further and try to rewrite this sum ok.
So, once I have rewritten this sum, my analogy is further amplified. For example, if you
look at the coefficient of 
 , yes, it was it is 
 and 
 which is the coefficient of 
so that also means this means if I can sum over this 
 from 0 to what point to a point where
I want the sum the exponent is raised to k, then I will get all possible combinations where
sum is actually 
In a similar manner, you can pause this video and verify whether you are getting the same
expression for 
 and all others right. So, with this understanding, I am ready to generalize
this demonstration or this theory for a polynomial of an arbitrary order.
Let us consider polynomials of degree n and m, and try to find the general answer for them,
and that answer will be in this form. So, if you are given a polynomial of degree 
and if you are given another polynomial of degree 
), let us say 
Even if 
 it does not matter, but for our purposes let us take 
, then what will
be the coefficient of each of the 
s? The coefficient is actually given here, 
this is what we have figured out in this expression is the coefficient of 
Then the question is how far the degree will go? The degree will go till 
; if
 then the degree will go to 2 
 that is ok. So, 
 = 0 to 
, and each of the
coefficient of 
 will be 
. Now, let us demonstrate this idea with one example.
Let us go ahead and see one example of this idea.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:36)
So, now, you have been given two polynomials two quadratic polynomials and you are
asked to compute the multiplication of these two polynomials. One way is very simple you
will go with term by term multiplication, and it simply means you have to multiply the
terms of second polynomial with the first polynomial in a term by term fashion, or you can
actually use the formula that I have given you in the previous slide. So, you can pause this
video, and try to compute by yourself or you can go along with me.
So, let us recall that formula again that is 
) is equal to sum a, so my polynomial is a
polynomial of degree 
, and 
) is a polynomial of degree 
. In this case, in this
particular example, the polynomial the first polynomial is of degree 2 as well as the second
polynomial is of degree 2.
So, in order to find the product of these two polynomials, what do we need to find is we
simply need to find the coefficients of 
 . So, let us first identify what are 
s and what
are 
 is a dummy index. So, it does not matter.
So, let us first identify what are 
s and 
s. So, 
 as you can see is 1, 
 is 1, a 1 is 1
again, 
 is 2, correct, this is correct, and then 
 and 
 both are 1. So, I have enlisted all
the coefficients of this particular expression, 
) and expressions 
) and 
). Now,
we need to use this formula, then this formula which gives me the sum. So, let us use this
formula and figure out.
Remember, all the coefficients that are not listed here. For example, what will be 
 , if at
all, I will write 
 , what will be 
 in this expression? It will be 0. What will be 
 in this
expression? It will be 0. So, all the coefficients that are not listed here are 0s. Keep this in
mind and try to answer the question.
So, now, computation of coefficient; it is very easy. So, let us start with 0th degree term
that is constant term. So, here 
 = 0. So, the summation will actually go from 
 = 0 to 0,
that means, it will have only one term which is 
What is 
 ? Look here 1 into 1, so it will give you 1 ok. Let us go for a degree 1 term.
So, 
 is equal to 0 to 1, 
 is equal to 0 to 1, so it will have, 
 these two terms are
there. So, let us compute them through this table 
 is 1, 
 is 1, so this will retain 1. 
 is 2, so it will give you 2. So, together it is 1+ 2 = 3.
Let us go for a second order term that is the monomial with degree 2. So, in this case, 
will run from 0 to 2. So, I will have 
 , this is
correct. Just go ahead and compute these terms, 
 is 1, 
 is 1, so you will get 1, 
 is 1,
 is 2, so you will get 2. And 
 that is 
 is 1, 
 is 1, so you will get another 1. So,
you will get the sum to be 4.
Let us go for a third term 
 term, and just simply substitute this. So, we need to find all
possible combinations. So, if it is a degree 3 term and we start with 
 , it will be 
 , these are the terms. And then you simply compute them.
Remember here now we came up with 
 . What is 
 is not listed here, that means, b
 must be 0. In a similar manner here 
 must be 0 correct. So, these 2 terms are chopped
off right away they are 0. So, let us focus on the other 2 terms the first term you can easily
verify because 
 is 1, and 
 is 1. And 
 is 2, 
 is 1, so it will be 2. So, 1+ 2=3;
this is correct.
Now, the final term is a degree 4 term, correct. If you do a term wise multiplication, what
you will come up with is because the degree 4 will be contributed by the highest order
terms.
So, you will simply multiply 
 , and you will get only 1 term. But in this formulation
what we are doing here is we are taking all possible terms of degree 4. So, even though
they are 0, we will first list them, and we will put them as 0s.
So, now, when we consider degree 4 term, I will get 
 and
 . So, all these terms are here. And most of the terms will obviously, be 0 only 1 term
is a contributor.
For example, 
 is 0, 
 will be 0, 
 is 0, 
 is 0. Why? Because 
all are 0 only term that will contribute is 
 which will be 1
1, so 1. So, this gives us a
clear cut answer, and this is a systematic way to multiply two polynomials.
Therefore, the resultant polynomial 
) simply write the terms from this table, so
this is a coefficient of 
 is 1, so the constant term 1 is here coefficient of 
 is 3, so 3
here. So, in a similar manner 
 coefficient of 
 is 4. So, you will get 4
 here ok; so 3
correct.
So, this is also done. And then 
 has only 1 term as 1, so 
 . Therefore, you got the
resultant polynomial to be equal to this. Now, remember one side note the multiplication
of two polynomials will always fetch you a polynomial again ok. Next operation is division
which we will see in the next video, but the division of two polynomials will not always
lead to a polynomial. We will see that in the next video.
Bye for now.
Thank you.
