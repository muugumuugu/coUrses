Logarithmic Functions: Graphs
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
Hello friends, in the last video, we have seen how to graph a function 
) = log 
. In
particular, we have seen two kinds of graphs or two kinds of divisions, when our a is between
0 and 1 the graph has one form and when a was > 1 the graph has the other form.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:44)
In particular, what we have seen is if the graph of exponential function for a < 1 there is the
graph of a raise to 
 for a < 1 is given by a red line, then you can actually reflect this graph
along the blue line which is 
 and get the corresponding graph forlog10 
 of 
 when 0 < a
< 1.
In a similar manner, when a is > 1 the matters are, matter is very easy. And you see there is
because there is no intersection, you can simply reflect the red line along the blue line to get
the green line and the final graphs will look like this. So, this is the this is the case where my a
is > 1 and this is the case where 0 < a is < 1. In particular, we have already seen some something
similar in the, when we studied exponential functions. In particular, we will try to list all the
properties of this graph of exponential function.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:52)
So, let us start our journey of listing the properties of graph of logarithmic function. So, first
thing is the domain of the function we as it is an inverse function of exponential function is
(0, 
) and the range of a function is real line, when you studied exponential function, the
intercept was (0,1) here the 
 intercept is (1, 0) and there was no 
 intercept here, there is no 
intercept, because simply because it is reflection along 
 line.
Then you had (vertic) in when you studied exponential function, you had a horizontal
asymptote that is 
 axis was your asymptote in this case, you will have a vertical asymptote
and that is 
 =0 is the line it is easily visible over here. For example, if you look at this green
line, the vertical asymptote is towards the positive side of 
 that is positive side of 
 axis. And
if you look at this particular picture, it is towards negative side of 
 axis.
So, these are the typical features that you can you will understand when you look at the graph
of a logarithmic function, then naturally this is the inverse function of a one to one function.
So, it is one to one and it passes through two points. If you recollect, the exponential function
was passing through 0.01 and 1 a. So, naturally this function will pass through points 1 0 and
a 1 all the time. So, these are the two static points whenever you consider a graph of a
logarithmic function.
As it is visible from the graph for 0 < a < 1 this green curve is actually a decreasing function.
And for a > 1, this green curve is actually an increasing function. So, that those properties
naturally boiled down to for 0 < a < 1 the function is decreasing and for a > 1 the function is
increasing.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:07)
So, these are important properties of graph of logarithmic function. So, while drawing the
graphs of logarithmic function in a standard form, you should always remember whether you
are satisfying these properties or not, that is a cross check whether your answer is correct or
not.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:29)
So, let us enhance our knowledge by taking an example of drawing a graphs drawing a graph
is not correct, or drawing graphs of the functions that drawing the graphs of the
functions,
) = 
 log 4 (
 + 1) and 
) =log 1 (
 + 1).
Now, you remember the domains the domains of the function. So, here if I want to draw a
graph, let us take the function 
) here If I want to take a graph of 
), so, first let us
understand how the graph of log 4 
will look like in order to understand this let us go to the
properties is a the base > 1 or < 1 this is the first concern, so my base is > 1.
So, the function should be increasing okay naturally the function is one to one and my curve
should pass through (1,0) and (4,1) correct and I should have vertical asymptote at 
naturally the function is actually increasing that means, I will come from down to up and
therefore, and obviously 
 intercept is (1,0) domain of 
 is 0 to 
 range of f is 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:02)
So, keeping all these things in mind, let me draw a quick sketch of this graph log 4 (
). So, let
me change the colour and it will be like this this is an asymptote, then it will pass through this
point and you know what this point is and then it will be like this, this is the basic understanding
it should pass through point (1,0) this is the point (1, 0) and (a, 1).
So, 4, 1 should be the point that it should pass through. So, naturally let us see this 1, 4 on 
axis and this is 1 on 
 axis. So, as it passes through (4,1). So, this is these are 4 units this is 1
unit. So, this is 1 unit and that is 4 units on 
 axis this is 1 unit. So, this is how the graph will
look like, but you have not been given a graph of log 4 
So, what is happening it is going to 
+1. So, now, log 4 (
 + 1), how will it look like? That is
the next question. So, what we are doing is we are shifting it on 
 axis. So, whatever value 
was taking now, 
+1 is taking that is a shift along this direction and shift along this direction
of 1 unit. That means, that simply means, again you can easily quickly draw the graph, rough
sketch of the graph whatever was happening for this particular thing, everything will shift and
let me write use a green colour.
Now, instead of having 
, instead of having this, this particular 
 axis as an intercept, I
will have a new horizontal vertical asymptote which will be at 1 unit apart and my curve will
pass through this this will be my new asymptote and my curve will pass through this and it will
behave like this simple. So, instead of 1, 0, everything is translated by 1 unit. So, I will have 0,
0 the values on 
 axis will not change values on 
 axis will change. So, everything is translated
by your 1 unit. So, I will have a point 0, 0 and this point where it intersects it will be 3,1. So,
now this is my new graph of locked to the base 4 of 
Now, the twist that is added is the-sign. So, that means it this is the graph of 
 =log 4 (
 + 1).
Now, if I add a-sign to this, the 
 will become the -y. So, now reflection along 
 axis so, the
well what I have d1 is reflection along 
 axis. What I actually meant was reflection along 
axis. So, the graph of this function should reflect along the 
 axis when I substitute 
(Refer Slide Time: 9:55)
Therefore, the graph will simply twist itself along the file along the line 
 along 
 axis and
therefore, the upside will go down and the downside will go up and therefore, the function will
look like this, that is all. So, as you can easily see, the function will look like this the point 0,
0 will remain intact and then point 3,1. So, 3 on 
 will become (3,-1), rest of the things will
remain intact. And naturally this is how the graph will look like that is all.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:45)
So, let us go to the next problem that is 
) = log 1 (
 + 1) so, now we will first look at,
can I draw a graph of log 1 (
). The answer is yes I can draw and it will be simply this kind of
graph. So, let me draw it a quick snapshot of that graph log 4 (
) by quick snapshot will give
me something like this. So, this is the point and this will increase keep on increasing and it
should pass through 1, 0 and a, 1. So, that point will be here somewhere. So, 1, 0 and a 1 so, ,
1 and 1, 0 correct. So, somewhere here it will be 4 and 1 so this is a point 1 here, fine.
Now, the twist is this particular function is twisted with log 1 (
). So, wherever 
 is there, you
are replacing the values with-
 that simply changes the paradigm that is, you are taking a
reflection along the 
 axis. So, now essentially when I substitute
, this will be an asymptote
this will still remain an asymptote and the graph will switch like this it is an exact mirror image
of this along 
 axis.
So, naturally the point 0, 1 will become 0-1, 0-1 and that , 11 will become (
, 1). So, that
also will be there. So, this is how the graph will look like now, you are adding a twist to the
problem by adding+1. So, what will this thing this operation do. So, earlier 
 = log 1 (
). was
there. Now, adding+1 will simply shift these values along 
 axis in upward direction 1 level
(Refer Slide Time: 13:10)
So, naturally the graph will look something like this. So, the point 1,0 will now be shifted to
1,1 that is this point and 4,1 will be shifted to 4,2 that is this point. So, these are the two points.
So, we are able to map those two points and therefore, the verification of graph is complete and
this is the current graph.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:52)
So, now in the next thing that we want to introduce to you is like logarithmic function to the
general base a we have some special logarithmic function that is called natural logarithmic
function which is which involves the notion of Euler
s constant that is e and this is very special
as the natural exponential function is special.
So, this function is defined in a separate way as the natural logarithmic function and it is defined
as log 
, where the base is e we have already seen the importance of e in past few videos. But,
to add to the speciality, we have some special notation for this log 
 it is always denoted by
, where l stands for logarithm and n stands for natural base.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:50)
And whenever we write this as ln of 
 that simply means, I am talking about the natural
logarithm of 
 that is log 
. So, hence forth whenever we discuss about natural logarithmic
function, we have to use this notation ln of 
 it is quite standard simple verification, you can
actually check ln of e raise to 
 is 
 for 
 belonging to 
 which is the domain of 
 and 
 ln 
 for 
 belonging to positive real line, which is the domain of ln x.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:39)
In a similar manner, there is some other log there are some other logarithms, what is called this
called natural log something else is called common logarithm, which has to do with our decimal
representation and common logarithm is actually denoted as log without any base. So, that
means, it is log10 
 = log 
So, in general, the common in common terminology, you may consider when there is no
mention of a log, you may consider this log is to the base 10 and if something like ln 
written, that is log 
. So, this is what you these are the important things you need to remember.
In olden days when we used to use calculators, there were two separate keys associated with
this 1 key was ln and another key was log.
So, in these keys, they were commonly referring to log10 
if I am talking about log and log to
the natural base if I am talking about ln, so just remember these are two commonly used
logarithms, which we will use quite often in our daily practice. Calculators distinguish them
with ln and log and we prefer that you also distinguish them with ln and log. This finishes the
topic of natural logarithm, natural logarithm nothing is special. It is just a way of taking the
logs with e as a base.
