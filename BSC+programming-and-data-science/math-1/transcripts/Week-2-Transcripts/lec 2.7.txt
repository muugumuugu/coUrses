So, what we have seen so far is, what is a relation of the slope with respect to line and we
have exploited certain how we can use the slope to determine whether the lines are parallel
perpendicular. And, if I know the slope of the line then how will I find a slope of two non vertical lines, then how will I find the relation between angles and other properties.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:41)
Now, we will come to the Representation of a Line, as we have already seen slope cannot
represent a line uniquely. So, what is it that, that is required for representing a line uniquely?
So, this raises two questions, how to represent a line uniquely? And the second question is,
given any point of how will you decide whether that point lies on the line or not?
So, in order to answer these two questions, let us take the first question first and rephrase it.
So, if I want to represent a line uniquely, then what I need to figure out is, I need to figure out
a condition or a definite expression which will describe the line in terms of its coordinate
plane. So, for a given line l I should be able to find a definite condition or expression which
describes the line in terms of coordinate plane. That is in terms of the coordinates or to be
more precise what should be the condition on the coordinates in order to describe the line l.
If I can understand what is this condition then the second question is automatically answered
because if the coordinates of P are given to me and they satisfy the condition or expression
for the line l then they must lie on the line l otherwise they do not lie on the line l, then it is
just a simple job of checking whether that condition is satisfied or not. So, with this in mind
we will try to answer the first question that is how to represent a line uniquely?
Now, what kind of lines we have seen so far? We have seen lines which are similar to X axis, lines which are similar to Y - axis; those are typically horizontal and vertical lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:37)
Let us first understand, what is a horizontal line. So, a line is said to be a horizontal line if it
is of this form, now this line can be infinitely many. So, you can have infinitely many
horizontal lines as can be seen from the video. Now, how to represent this line uniquely is my
question. So, let us say I need to find this line or the condition for this line, how can I find the
condition for this line?
So, let us first define this line as a horizontal line and let us say horizontal line is a horizontal
line if and only if it is parallel to X - axis, this is our definition of a horizontal line. Now, if I
want to specify this line uniquely what do I need to know? I need to know the distance of this
line or the location of this line from X - axis, that is I need to know the y coordinate of this
line you can see here. So, I want to locate this line or the value that it takes on Y - axis if I
want to specify this line.
Let us say this value is given to be a then I know it is a horizontal line. So, all points will lie
at a same distance from X - axis therefore, all points will satisfy the condition y=a. You take
any point on this line it will satisfy the condition y=a.
So, in case of horizontal lines what I have done is I have identified the condition that is y=a.
So, what will be the condition on points? The points will be of the form ( x ,a), x can be any
value, but the y coordinate of that point will be fixed that is a. In a similar manner we can
consider vertical lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:02)
So, what is a vertical line? You can see this in this image and in this video, we can see all
these kind lines are called vertical lines. So, how will I identify these vertical lines? First, I
will define the vertical lines a line is a vertical line if and only if it is parallel to Y - axis.
Now, to specify the location what do I need? To locate a line, I need to know the distance of
this line from Y - axis ok. So, that essentially means what value it takes on x coordinate or X
- axis.
So, how will you identify this? You just need to identify the one point in this particular line
let us say this is the point and I need to see what is the distance of this point from X - axis, if
that is b, then all points of the form (b , y) will be lying on this line; all points of the form
(b , y) will be lying on this line. And therefore, the equation of the line the expression for the
line will have a form x=b.
I mentioned the all points will be of the form (b , y). So, if I get two points where the y
coordinate where the x coordinate is fixed and I know it is a line then I know it is parallel to
Y - axis or it is a vertical line right. In a similar manner the other one is parallel to X - axis
and it will be a horizontal line. Let us make it more crystal clear by solving one example.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:49)
So, here is an example where a question is given to you want to find the equation or
expression for the lines parallel to the axis and passing through point (5,7). Now, the lines
are passing through point (5,7) and it is also given that they are parallel to axes. So, a line
which is parallel to X - axis is known as horizontal line, a line which is parallel to Y - axis is
known as vertical line. So, essentially this question asks you to find one horizontal line and
one vertical line.
So, let us go to the coordinate plane, this is the coordinate plane let us locate the point (5,7),
it will be somewhere here. Now let us first focus on identifying the horizontal line. What is a
horizontal line? A line which is parallel to X - axis is a horizontal line. So, a line which is
parallel to X - axis, then what do I need to know? Its distance from X - axis, the distance is 7
according to this particular expression because (5,7) is a point on that line.
So, the distance is 7 so, the line must appear somewhere here, now further the next question
is I want to find a vertical line that passes through point (5,7). So, now I need to know the
distance of a line from X - axis. So, I will locate point 5 over here and all points on the line
on that particular line will be of the form (5, y). So, (5,7) will also fall on that line. So, this
is the line; so, this is how we will find the lines.
Now what are the typical equations of the line? So, the horizontal line will be y=7 and the
vertical line will be x=5. This is how we will study horizontal and vertical line. So, what is a
vertical line? Vertical line has inclination as at 90 degrees, and therefore, the slope of this line
is not defined remember this in mind.
Another point which is horizontal line it never intersects actually X - axis, but the inclination
of this line with respect to X - axis is 0 degrees therefore, it will have a slope 0. So, we have
eliminated the cases where the slope does not exist or slope is 0, now we need to identify
similar kind of expressions for lines which are not vertical. So, let us go further and identify
such expressions.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:48)
So, here as we already know that slope cannot uniquely determine line, then the question is
which slope if I give you some more information can you determine the line? So, here in this
case what we are identifying is we are giving a point and giving a slope and then we are
asking a question can we solve this problem or can we find a unique expression for a given
line? So, the question is for a non-vertical line l vertical line we do not have to consider
because the slope is not defined. So, for a non-vertical line l with slope m and a fixed-point P
( x0 , y0 ) on the line can we find the equation or the algebraic representation of a geometric
object that is line is the question.
So, here what are the things that we know? We know slope and we know a point on the line.
So, in order to answer this question, we know that two points uniquely determine a line. So,
let us take another point Q ( x , y ) . I do not know the coordinates of these points, but I assume
that this point lies on line l. Now, I know from the definition of slope that I have defined
change in y by change in x the slope of a line is given by. So, what are the two points now? Q
and P.
So, change in y will be y
 y o and change in x will be x
x0. So, I know m=
 y 0
, this is
what I know from my definition. It has nothing to do with tan 
 even if you have it you can
find out what is tan 
, but since nothing is known in specific we cannot find the tan 
, but
tan 
is anyway given to you in terms of slope.
So, now I have m=
 y 0
. So, how will I find the condition on x and y? Just cross multiply
this x
x0 , you will get an expression which is y
 y 0 =m(x
x0 ). This condition uniquely
identifies my line, there cannot be any other line satisfying this condition.
So, therefore, any point that lies on this particular line that is P ( x , y) that lies on this
particular line, it must satisfy the condition that is given here. This form of expression is
called point slope form. So, this is a point slope form of equation which essentially says that
give me one point and slope of the line I will give you the equation of a line.
The beauty is the geometric object now can be represented in terms of the equation, initially
when we started, we tried to represent a point which is a geometric object in terms of
coordinate plane and the coordinates of the point. Now we are giving infinite set of points
having certain condition that is a geometric object of line how you can represent it
algebraically using the equation of a line. So, this is point slope form. Let us try to see how
we can use the point slope form in our problem solving.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:40)
So, now, I have been asked to find the equation of a line which passes through point (5, 6)
and has slope of 
2. Here the interesting thing is slope is negative. So, let us identify the
point (5, 6) on the coordinate plane and now I want to identify the line that passes through
this with slope of -2. So, now I have a formula for point slope form, I can use that formula
and I can straight away derive it for let us try Q ( x , y) is an arbitrary point.
So, I need two points to identify a line. So, Q ( x , y ) with the arbitrary point on this line then
using point slope formula we simply substitute 
, slightly rearrange the terms; what
you will get is y
6=2(5
x). If you simplify this you will get the expression y=16
2 x.
Now, let us try to see, if I want to know this value of x what point what value of y will satisfy
this equation. Let us put x is equal to 3 here if I put x is equal to 3 here then I get y is equal to
10 after simplifying this I will get y=10.So, that means, the point (3, 10) should lie on this
particular line. So, let us see that (3, 10) is here and now you know from basic geometry that
two points uniquely identify a line. So, you can just draw a line using your ruler passing
through these two points this is the line that we are expecting.
So, the question did not ask you to draw a graph, but drawing graph always verifies whether
you have found a correct answer or not. So, it is better to cross check using graphs. So, the
answer to the question is the equation of the line passing through point (5, 6) and slope -2 is
y=16
2 x . Now, suppose somebody decides not to give me slope and somebody says that
now you have been given only two points; can you find the equation of line?
The answer is; obviously, yes because given two points I can always determine the slope
right for example, in our earlier case when we defined slope I need to figure out what is
change in y and what is change in x using these two points and that will give me slope to be
equal to -2. And therefore, I can always use this formulation to find the equation of the line,
but you can use this knowledge and derive another form that is equation of a line two - point
form.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:00)
So, given two points the question is can you determine the line uniquely which should be
possible and through our basic knowledge of geometry we already know that two points
uniquely determine a line, now we will see that in our coordinate geometry. So, the
assumption is let the line l pass through points P and Q with coordinates ( x1 , y 1 ) and ( x2 , y 2 ).
To start with this, I will take another point R which is arbitrary point because I want to find
the condition in terms of coordinates. So, whenever I want to find the equation of line I will
start with an arbitrary point. So, R ( x , y ) is an arbitrary point on the line l. Now, look at these
three points P, Q, and R they all lie on one line therefore, the points P, Q, and R are collinear
yes; so, points P, Q, and R are collinear.
Therefore, suppose I consider only these two points P and R, using these two points P and R,
I can easily figure out the slope of a line. If I consider points P and Q, I also know the slope
of a line; now because these points are collinear what can you say about slope of line PR and
slope of line PQ, both must be same or equal? So, slope of PR is equal to slope of PQ because
they are collinear.
So, if this is the case, then what is slope of PR? You can easily figure out P is this ( x1 , y 1 )and
R is ( x , y). So, the slope of PR first you consider change in y, y
 y 1 upon change in x that is
x1that is slope of PR. What is slope of PQ? PQ is( x1 , y 1 ) and ( x2 , y 2 ). So, y change in y is
 y1 and change in x is x2 
(Refer Slide Time: 19:21)
Therefore, I will get the equation of this form
 y 1 y2 
 y 1
x1 x2 
So, again if you look at it closely this particular thing is nothing, but the slope of a line m and
we are doing things which are very similar to slope point form. But instead of counting it
explicitly we are counting it as a ratio and then you rearrange the term and you will get this
expression because you just take this denominator on the other side and you will get this
expression.
Now, this line is again uniquely characterized and therefore, any point that lies on this line
must satisfy this condition. So, if your point is R lies on this line then it must satisfy this
condition and this form is called two - point form. So, remember these are the formulas that
we are deriving; first was slope line formula, second is two - point form.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:38)
Let us understand this formula better by solving some examples. So, let us take one example
where I want to find the equation of a line that is passing through two points
( 5 ,10 )
2). Let us identify these two points on a coordinate plane ( 5 ,10 ) ,(
2). I
want to find the equation of this line.
So, I will use another point Q which is an arbitrary point and it has a coordinate( x , y), I will
use the two - point form. So, using two- point form what should I get? So, I am taking, this
point P. So, ( y
10 )=
5). So, always remember this order does not matter I can
always start with this as well. So, change in y is 10
2) and change in x is 5
4) in both
cases my answer to this particular fraction will be
which is .
So, it does not matter whether you take this as ( x1 , y 1 ) or you take this as ( x1 , y 1 ), you will
always get the same answer. So, if you simplify this you will get the expression of a line
because as I mentioned the slope was
. So, you just simplify this you will get the expression
of a line3 y=4 x+10. So, this will be the line that is passing through these two points.
