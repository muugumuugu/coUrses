In the 7th question we have two points, one is the origin O, and some other point P (7, 3). And
this line segment OP is being rotated. So first, lets mark out these points.
(Refer Slide Time 00:32)
So first lets mark out these points, we have this is the origin and this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, this
is 1, 2, 3. So our point P is here, this is P (7, 3) and this is the origin of course O. And we
have this line segment OP given to us. Now, OP is being rotated by 360
 about the x axis, lets
see what that means. So every point on OP is going around the x axis in a circle, that is what
rotation is, rotation is a combined circular motion of many particles, here we have this point
let us take P, P goes around the x axis reaching this bottom point, then it circles back to itself.
So you would see the circle if you looked at it from the right. From the screen
s perspective,
this is what it will look like. And this is the case with every point on this line.
Suppose I took this point, this is just oppositely going to go till here in this circle and return
back. So, every point is doing this circle, which means on this side we actually have the
mirror image of OP with respect to the x axis which looks something like this. So, we have
these circles being formed due to the rotation and as you can see, the final shape it appears to
be a cone that is what has happened. Take a line segment and you rotate it about some central
axis, you obtain a cone about that central axis.
(Refer Slide Time 02:53)
And they have given us the volume of a cone, volume of a cone is (4/3)
R2h, where R is the
radius of the base circle and h is the height of the cone.
(Refer Slide Time 03:16)
So in the cone we have obtained the radius, base radius is this quantity, which is R = 3
because it is a y coordinate of the point P that is a distance of point P from the x axis. And
likewise, if you observe the height of this cone, that quantity h = 7 because the x coordinate
of point. In this way, we can obtain the volume of our cone using the formula that is given V=
(4/3)
R2h. We are going to approximate pi to be 3.14 or 22 by 7. So, this is roughly equal to
(4/3)(22/7)(9)(7) so 7 and 7 cancels of, 3 and 9 gives us 3. So we get 264 cubic units, so this
is our volume of the cone.
(Refer Slide Time 04:54)
Now in the second part of this question, it is being said that the rotation is done around the y
axis instead of the x axis, so what will this look like?
(Refer Slide Time 05:08)
So, this OP is going to have a mirror image about the y axis which is going to look like this.
So that means, our point P is going around in a circle to reach this opposite point here and it
is coming back to itself. So this would become the base circle for our new cone which is
obtained by rotation about the y axis. Now as you can see, this value is already the height so
height is 3 now, whereas the radius is basically 7. So, our height is 3 and radius is 7 so these
values have changed. So, if we call this quantity, this volume to be V2, V2 is (4/3)
R2h, which
will be roughly equal to (4/3)(22/7)(7)(7)(3). So, 3 and 7 cancel off here and we get this is
equal to 616 cubic units. So, this is the volume if OP is rotated about the y axis 360
, so that
cone
s volume is 616 cubic units.
(Refer Slide Time 06:58)
This problem gets progressively more complex, we are now adding the new point (14, 6)
which is along the line segment OP, it is on the extension of OP, and then PQ is rotated about
x axis by 360
(Refer Slide Time 07:25)
So, lets see what is happening here, so our point (14, 6) Q, (14, 6) is here, which gives us PQ
as this line segment. And now, they are saying that PQ is being rotated about the x axis which
will result in the mirror image in this way. This is -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6. So, we are here
now, I think we can call this point T and this point is S. So, we have ST in this way again, so
what we see here the rotated geometry. So, for reference we are going to take one more point
here, which kind of moves around. So, what we are seeing here this is what is called the
frustum of a cone. This is a cut-off portion of a larger cone which would be QO rotated about
the x axis.
(Refer Slide Time 08:56)
So, thus as you can see, the volume we require is the frustum of the cone which is this region
and this volume is the result of subtracting this volume from the total cone. So, we already
know this volume OP as that cone
s volume to be 264 cubic units. So, the blue shaded region
that would be the volume of the large cone that is of OQ rotating about x axis and that we can
calculate as V3 = (4/3)
R2h, where this is approximately equal to (4/3)(22/7)(6)(6)(14). So, 3
s 3 two
s, 7 one
s 7 two
s, so we have 2,112 cubic units. So the volume we require is
going to be 2,112 
 264 = 1,848 cubic units.
