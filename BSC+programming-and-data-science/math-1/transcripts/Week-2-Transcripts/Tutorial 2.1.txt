(())(0:18) In this tutorial we are going to look at the problems which are related to contents of
week 2, that is to do with straight lines and all these topics here.
(Refer Slide Time 00:34)
So, we will start with our first question. The data provided here is, there is a company which is
selling mobile phones and it all begins in March 2019. In March 2019, the selling price was
8000 and it was sold at 8000 rupees, mobile A was sold at 8000 rupees from March until June.
After that, due to increasing demand, the company decided to increase the price by 250 each
month, so they are selling better.
So, they have decided to increase their price by 250 rupees every month. This went on until a
new mobile B was launched at a lesser price, competition at a lesser price was launched in
January. So, because of this the selling price of A dropped at a rate of 500 per month, from
January till March 2020, so 2 months it had decreased. We are expected to demonstrate a clear
graph of this. For that let us look at this graph.
(Refer Slide Time 01:58)
What we need to realize about situations like this is, the 
 and 
 axis do not necessarily
represent the same units. So, we have along the 
 axis 1 unit is 1 month, however along the 
axis 1 unit is, let us take about 250 rupees. So, 1 month and 250 rupees are not the same thing,
so please remember this in situations like this. Now, because we are beginning from March let
us take the starting month to be March, then this is April, May, and so on.
So, our entire problem deals with this 1 year span from March 2019 to March 2020, so this will
be along our 
 axis. And now along the 
 axis, if we took each unit to be 250, then this is 250
and this is 500 and so on, the 8000 will be beyond our screen. So, to better represent our
situation, we are going to introduce a zigzag here to indicate that a lot of values have been
compressed into this little space. So, we are going to start from 8000 and this is going to be
8250, 8500, so on. And now we begin to mark out the points that we have, we know that in
month of March the price was 8000, so this is the point for the month of March.
And then in April, May, and June the price stayed constant so it is been like this. And this
portion can be represented using a horizontal line and this line is y is equal to 8000. Beyond
that, the price had been increasing by 250 every month so in July we will be here, August here,
September here, this will be October, this will be November, this is December, and this is
January.
So, this segment can be indicated by this line, in order to find out the equation of this line we
use the 2 point form, so we first write 2 points on this line segment. You could choose this one
which is August, and for that let us number our months now, so March will be 0, April is 1,
May is 2, June is 3, this is 4 and this is 5. So, our price point here it is (5, 8500).
I am ready to take another month, so let us take October, this is the seventh month from March
2019, so this point becomes (7, 9000). Using these 2 points, we can find the equation of the
line by employing the 2 point form of the line equation,
2 , 
2 are two points on the line segment. So, here we can see it as
would be equal to
1 , where 
1 , 
1 and
8500
9000
8500
. So, this
= 250.
So that implies 
 8500 = 250(
 5), which finally gives us the line equation to be 
 1250 + 8500 plus this line is y = 250
 + 7250. Moving on, the next 2 months, the
price dropped by 500 each month. So, here we are at 9750, then for February we should be at
9250, so this will be our point for February and then the next month again 500 drop we will
reach here, which is 8750. And this line segment also corresponds to a straight line, which also
we can find using the 2 point form.
So, this point here is, let us number the months completely, this is 8, this is 9, this is 10, this is
11, this is 12. So, this point here, which is January is the tenth month, and the 
 axis gives us
9750 whereas this point here, this is the twelvth month, and it corresponds to 8750. And again,
we would like to know the line equation for this and we use the 2 point form again.
So, this is
8750
9750
8750
that gives us
1000
500. Plus we have 
 8750 = 
6000. That gives us 
 + 14750, so this is our new length. And this is a clear graph
of the situation and the given question.
(Refer Slide Time 09:18)
For the part B of this question, it is asked, what is the price of mobile A in December. So, this
is the December month, which would be this point here which has a price of 9500, so this is
our answer for B. And then in C it has asked, calculate the slope of mobile A
s price from
January to March 2020, so we want the slope of this segment here and this slope we had already
calculated, it was 
9750
8750
1000
500.
And because of the negative slope you can see that it is a decreasing function, which is what is
happening, the price had fallen at 500 per month. Lastly, we have being asked, what is the price
of mobile A in March 2020, so this is March 2020, this is a point and we have already found
the price which is 8750 that is our part.
