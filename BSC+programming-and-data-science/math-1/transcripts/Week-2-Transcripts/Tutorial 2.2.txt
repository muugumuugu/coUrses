In the second question, the reserved triangular field ABC, whose coordinates are given. And if
watering costs rupees 10 per unit square, so they are giving the cost of watering the field, and
it is so and so amount per unit square that is area, how much would you have to pay for the
whole field? So, we would like to find out the area of the field. And then if the fencing wire
around the field costs rupees 5 per unit, how much should he have to pay for 3 rounds of fencing
around this field that is find the perimeter, so find the area and perimeter of this particular field.

So, if we consider this to be our origin, the triangle is made up of these points, (1, 1), this will
be (9, 1) and this is (1, 7). So, this is our triangle, this is A, this is B, and this is C and you can
see that AC is completely vertical, its 
 coordinate remains the same, it is 1, and AB is
completely horizontal, its 
 coordinate remains the same, which is 1.
So, this is a right angled triangle. Now, we could use the area of triangle formula, the area will

, which in this case is going to be, you can take any of these
points to be 
1 and the others to, the next one to be 
2 and 
1 to be 
3 . The, how you
choose 
2 and 
3 does not matter, the order is what is important. Applying this
formula, we get our

2 , 
3 is 1.
|1(1

, and that is 24 square unit. However, the same problem
could be approached in a slightly different way which is, if I observe that this is a right angle
triangle, I could just do half into base into height. And here the base would be the length AB,
that is half into AB for which the height would be the length AC.
And now since AB is horizontal, you can directly take the length to be 
3 which is the
difference in the 
 coordinates, so
 6 we have 24 square unit. So, this worked out
because our triangle is a right-angled triangle. So now the cost of watering is supposed to be
the area into cost of watering per square unit which is 10 rupees, so total cost of watering is
equal to 24 into 10 that is rupees 240.

For the second part of the question, we require the perimeter of this triangle because fencing is
done along the perimeter, and they have to do 3 rounds of fencing at the rate of rupees 5 per
unit. So, we first find the perimeter.
(Refer Slide Time 05:39)
Perimeter would simply be AB plus BC plus CA, which is AB is clear it is 8 units, CA is also
clear which is 6 units, BC needs to be figured out and BC we find out using the Euclidean
distance, that is the 
1 )2 + (
1 )2 that is the square of the difference in 
coordinates plus the square of the difference in 
 coordinates, the whole under root.
So, this gives us 
8)2 + 62 = 
64 + 36 = 
100 = 10. So, we have 10. So, this quantity
is 10 and thus our perimeter is also 24 units and we need wiring for fencing around 3 rounds.
So, we will require 24 into 3 is equal to 72 unit of wire and then each unit has been fixed a
price of 5 rupees. So, we have 72 into 5 is rupees 360 is the cost of fencing.
