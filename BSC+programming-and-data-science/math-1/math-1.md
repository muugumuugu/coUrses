## Lec 4 - Set Theory

## Lecture 10 - Sets V/S Collections

> ℕ is defined in set theory as
>> 0 --> φ
>>1 --> {0, {0}} ==> {φ. {φ}}
>>2 --> {1, {1}} ==> {φ, {φ} ,{φ, {φ}}}
>> j+1 --> {j, {j}}


## Lecture 11 - Degrees of Infinity
>Enumaration - **bijection** with ℕ
>> Enumerable Sets are called Countable. They may be finite or infinite

### ℝ is uncountably infinit
> proof by diagonalization (enumarating sequences of {1,0} and picking the sequence off the diagonal --> negating it and hence finding a sequence that had not been counted

### Continuam Hypothesis
> Is there a set with cardinality between that of ℕ  and ℝ?
>> *Independent of Set Theory Axioms*, the existence of such a set cannot be proved or disproved.
