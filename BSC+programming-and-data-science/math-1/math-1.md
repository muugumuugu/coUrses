## Lec 1 - Natural Numbers and their Operations

>ℕ --> {0,1,2,3,....}
>>discrete set

### Operations of ℕ

+ \-
+ \*
+ /
+ a|b a is a *divisor* of b --> output *True* / *False*
+ %

	+ e


## Lec 4 - Set Theory

### Properties of a set
+ No duplicates included
+ order irrelavent

>subset --> set formed from selected elements of a superset
>> equivalent to ***binary sequences*** of the length #cardinality-of-superset

### Special Sets
+ φ --> Empty Set . Subset of All Sets Vacously.
+ ℙ(X) --> Set Of all Subsets of X.

## Lec 5 - Construction of Sets and Set Operations

>Set Comprehension
>> { *g*(x) | *some condition* on x, where x ∈ to a *certain* ***predifined*** *set* }}
>>> g              --> *transform*\
>>> some condition --> *filter*\
>>> predifined set --> *generator*

>Intervals

>Operations
>> Unions\
>> Intersections\
>> Set Difference\
>> Complementation relative to a Universal Sets

## Lec 6 - Relations
> Cartesion P
## Lec 8 - Prime Numbers

+ Euclid's Infinity of Primes.
+ π(x) = # of primes < x
+ Prime Number Th. - π(x)--> x/ln(x) as x-->∞


## Lec 9 - Why is a Number Irrational?

>The Real line is continous but some points on the line like √2, obtained from the pythogorean unit right triangle, cannot be represented as a ratio,
hence the need for irrational.

## Lec 10 - Sets V/S Collections

> ℕ is defined in set theory as
>> 0 --> φ\
>>1 --> {0, {0}} ==> {φ. {φ}}\
>>2 --> {1, {1}} ==> {φ, {φ} ,{φ, {φ}}}\
>> j+1 --> {j, {j}}

>>Arithmetic Operations are defined in terms of Set Building operations (Union, Intersection & Cartesion Product)

### Is there a Set of All Sets??? - Russel's Paradox

>generating by set comprehension. we can have a set of all sets that do not contain themselves but then does this set contain itself?
hence it is not definitive to form a set of all sets.

> In general call any unsuitable collection a **Class**.

## Lecture 11 - Degrees of Infinity
>Enumaration - **bijection** with ℕ
>> Enumerable Sets are called Countable. They may be finite or infinite

### ℝ is uncountably infinit
> proof by diagonalization (enumarating sequences of {1,0} and picking the sequence off the diagonal --> negating it and hence finding a sequence that had not been counted

### Continuam Hypothesis
> Is there a set with cardinality between that of ℕ  and ℝ?
>> *Independent of Set Theory Axioms*, the existence of such a set cannot be proved or disproved.
