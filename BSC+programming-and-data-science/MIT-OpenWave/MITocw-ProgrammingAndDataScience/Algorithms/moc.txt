Model Of Computation.
what operations an algo is allowed
how much operations cost - time/memory

===== Random access machine =====
* Random Access Memory - modelled by big array.
* in O(1) an algorithm can 
	* read in O(1) of words
	* do O(1) of computations
	* store O(1) of words
* O(1) registers

word ?? → w bits
* w>=log(memory-size)

===== Pointer Machine =====
* dynamically allocated objects
* an object has O(1) fields or a pointer
	* field = word
	* pointer = reference to object / Null
* has operation //follow pointer//.

===== Python Model =====
* "list" == real world array
	* indexed lookup takes O(1)
	* search takes O(n)
	* sort = O(nlogn)
	* append takes O(1) time by using table doubling
* onject with O(1) attributes → pointer machine model
* dicts
	* hash table
	* assignment takes O(1)
	* keys are a single word
	* lookup and search also takes O(1)
