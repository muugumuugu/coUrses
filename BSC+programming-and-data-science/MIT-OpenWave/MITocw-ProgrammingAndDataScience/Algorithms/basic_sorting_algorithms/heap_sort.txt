====== heap sort ======
Created Tuesday 12 October 2021

1. Build Max-heap from unordered array  → O(n)
2. Find max element A[1]
3. Swap elements A[n] with A[1]
4. now max element end is at the end of array
5. Discard node from heap and add it to sorted array, decrementing heap size
6. new root may violate mhp, but childrenare max heaps. →  run max heapify
7. goto → n steps of main weight O(lg(n))

//O(nlg(n))//
