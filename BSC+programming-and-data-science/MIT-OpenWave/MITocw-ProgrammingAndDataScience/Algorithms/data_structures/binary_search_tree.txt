===== Scheduling =====

==== Runway Resolution Problem ====
* Assume a airport with a single runway
* Reservations for future landings
* Reserve request specifies landing time t.
* Add **t** to the set **R** of landing times if no other landings are scheduled within **k** miniutes.
* Remove **t **from set R after plane lands
* efficiency required : O(lg(n))

==== trying different ADTs ====
1. unsorted array : 
	* check and insert : O(n)-->
2. sorted array :
	* searching for index → O(lg(n))
	* inserting → requires shifting → O(n) time
3. Heaps: min/max
	* the invariant is weak.
	* searching an element that is beyond the k-neighboured of t take O(n) time.
