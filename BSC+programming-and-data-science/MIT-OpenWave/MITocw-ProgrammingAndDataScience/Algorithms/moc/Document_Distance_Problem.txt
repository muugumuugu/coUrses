====== Document Distance Problem ======
Created Sunday 10 October 2021
* document :  sequence of words
* word = string of alphanumeric chars
* idea for distance : count # of shared words
	* think of doc as a vector,indexed by words as dimensions.
	* D[w]=#occurences of w in D.
	* angle between the vectors is a good measure of similarity
==== Algorithm ====
1. split doc into words
2. compute word frequencies
3. dot product
