9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,820
PROFESSOR: We ended up the last
lecture talking about

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,800
dynamic programming.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,690
And we'll spend all of
today on that topic.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,550
We showed how it could be used
to provide a practical

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,070
solution to the shortest path
problem, a solution that would

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,860
allow us to solve what
was, in principle, a

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,060
complex problem quickly.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,390
And we talked about the
properties that make it

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,370
possible to solve that problem
and, in general, the

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,510
properties we need to make
dynamic programming

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,570
applicable.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,050
So let's return to that
topic right now.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,840
What we looked at is we looked
at two properties.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,770
The first was optimal
substructure.

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,440
And you recall what this meant
is that we can construct a

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,390
globally optimal solution by
combining solutions to local

25
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,760
subproblems.

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,590
So we've looked at a lot of
problems already this term

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,830
that have optimal
substructure--

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,850
merge sort, for example, which
exploits the fact that a list

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,940
can be sorted by first sorting
components of it and then

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,070
combining those.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,916
So merge sort exhibited
optimal substructure.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,630
The second property we looked
at was overlapping

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,880
subproblems.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,340
And what this meant was that in
the course of running our

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,130
algorithm, we would end
up solving the same

36
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,170
problem more than once.

37
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,020
And that is what gave us the
power of using memoization, to

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,050
use table lookup instead of
re-computing the solution.

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,210
Notice that merge_sort does
not have overlapping

40
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,280
subproblems.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,560
There's no reason that we would
expect, if we're sorting

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,880
a list, that we would
ever encounter the

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,510
same sublist twice.

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,420
And so in fact, we cannot
use dynamic

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,630
programming to solve sorting.

46
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,435
Because it has one of these
properties, but not both.

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,770
So how about shortest path?

48
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,420
Does it have these properties?

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,620
Well, let's first think about
optimal substructure.

50
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,730
You might begin by asking the
question if I knew the

51
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,110
shortest path from A to B, and
I knew the shortest path from

52
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,860
B to C, can I necessarily
combine those to get the

53
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,175
shortest path from A to C?

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,170
No, exactly right.

55
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,850
Because for example, maybe
there's a direct link from A

56
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,340
to C. So we can't combine
them that way.

57
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,780
So that gives us
the question--

58
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,260
Oh, pardon?

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,930
[INAUDIBLE]

60
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,960
PROFESSOR: --Almost
got it there.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,180
So that gives us the question,
what is the optimal

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,460
substructure here?

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,160
Well, there is something we do
know about shortest path, that

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,240
if I have the shortest path
from one node to another.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,440
And I take any sub path
of that, I will have--

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,920
so let's say I have a path
that goes from--

67
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,421
let's say I know that the
shortest path from A to C is A

68
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:40,808
to B to D to E to C. If this is
the shortest path from A to

69
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:45,450
C, I know that this is
the shortest path

70
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,120
from B to E. Right?

71
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,390
Because otherwise, I wouldn't
have bothered going through D.

72
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,090
If there were, for example, a
link directly from B to E,

73
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,410
then the shortest path
from A to C would not

74
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,660
have included this.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,640
So that's the optimal
substructure I have, and

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,670
that's the substructure that I
exploited last time in showing

77
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,900
you the dynamic programming
solution to the

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,150
shortest path problem.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,120
You also recall that we looked
at the shortest path.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,650
We'd found overlapping
subproblems.

81
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,270
Because I would end up solving
the same intermediate problem

82
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,650
multiple times, figuring
out how to get

83
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,640
from one node to another.

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,290
So indeed, we saw that the
shortest path problem

85
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,270
exhibited both of these
properties and therefore, was

86
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,580
amenable to solution by the
dynamic programming.

87
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,410
And in fact, we ran it and we
saw that it ran quite quickly.

88
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,400
It's not immediately obvious,
but the 0-1 knapsack problem

89
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,445
also exhibits both of
these properties.

90
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,570
You'll recall a few lectures
ago, and also in a problem set

91
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:20,990
not so long ago, we looked at
a recursive solution to the

92
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,892
0-1 knapsack problem.

93
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:27,730
It's called "solve"
in this code.

94
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,760
It uses backtracking to
implement the decision tree.

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,025
if we look at the decision
tree we had there--

96
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,540
I gave you a small example
here of the

97
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,700
0-1 knapsack problem.

98
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,740
I've got A, B, C and D. I've got
some values, and I've got

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,390
some weights.

100
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,670
We started by saying at the
beginning, we looked at this

101
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:12,240
node here, where we had decided
not to take anything .

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
We still had the list A, B,
C, and D to consider.

103
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,950
The total value of our items was
0, and for our example, I

104
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,220
think we had 5 pounds
of material left,

105
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,020
or 5 units of weight.

106
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,590
We then considered a decision.

107
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,210
What happens if we take A?

108
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,890
Well, if we take A, we have B,
C, and D left to consider.

109
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,550
We now look at this node
and say, all right,

110
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,830
our value is 6 --

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,975
the value of A. But we only
have 2 pounds left.

112
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,490
We then considered going
depth first, left

113
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,860
first in this case.

114
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,340
This is the depth-
first search.

115
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,160
We've looked at that before.

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,090
All right, let's consider
the next branch.

117
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:16,670
Well the next branch we'll
consider C. Well we discover--

118
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,170
no we'd consider B rather.

119
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,120
We can't take B, because
B weighs 3.

120
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,190
So this is a branch that
we can't get to.

121
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,230
We can elect the other decision
not to take B, in

122
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,620
which case we still have C
and D left to consider.

123
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,490
And still 6 and 2.

124
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,330
We then proceed and said right,
well can we take C?

125
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,580
Yes we can.

126
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,160
And that leaves us with
a value of 14

127
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,650
and no weight left.

128
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,440
So since we have no available
weights, we might as well stop

129
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,020
considering things.

130
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,020
So this is a terminal node.

131
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,140
We then back up, and said all
right, let's consider the

132
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,990
decision where we don't
take C. Can we take D?

133
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,650
And the answer is no because
it weighs too much.

134
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,980
And then we're done.

135
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,640
And so we see on this side of
the tree, we've explored

136
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,380
various possibilities.

137
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,575
And this is our best
option so far.

138
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,860
And we can walk through and now
we consider well, what if

139
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,020
we don't take A?

140
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,080
Well then we have these
decisions to make.

141
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,710
And eventually, we can
look at the whole

142
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,450
thing and make a decision.

143
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,380
By the way, I noticed this
morning that there was an

144
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,250
error on your handout.

145
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,100
I chose not to correct it in
the slide so that you would

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,490
notice it was in your
handout as well.

147
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,130
What should node 18 be?

148
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,780
What's the error here?

149
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:58,455
Pardon?

150
00:09:58,455 --> 00:09:59,705
[INAUDIBLE]

151
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,700
PROFESSOR: Right.

152
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,030
That should be the empty one.

153
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,900
Right?

154
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,142
Because we considered
everything.

155
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:12,170
And in fact, typically all of
your bottom nodes should

156
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,910
either have 0 weights or no
items left to consider.

157
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,550
Not very deep, just a typo but
has the advantage that by

158
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,710
looking for it, you can see
whether you understand how

159
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,831
we're constructing these
decision trees.

160
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:29,600
So this is a very common
way to deal with an

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,690
optimization problem.

162
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,240
You consider all combinations
of decisions in

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,640
a systematic way.

164
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,260
And when you're done, you
choose the best one.

165
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,720
So this is using depth-first
search and backtracking.

166
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,350
And this is essentially what you
did in your problem set.

167
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,670
Now what you saw in your problem
set is that if the set

168
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,240
of items is even moderately
large, this algorithm can take

169
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,070
a very long time to run.

170
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,230
How long?

171
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,620
Well, at each level of the tree
we're deciding whether to

172
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,700
keep or not keep one item.

173
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,650
So what's the maximum
depth of the tree?

174
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,750
How many levels can
this tree go?

175
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,200
If we have n items--

176
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,560
Pardon?

177
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,432
[INAUDIBLE]

178
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:28,630
PROFESSOR: n levels--

179
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,800
exactly.

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,335
So if we have n items,
it can go n levels--

181
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,040
Good grab.

182
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,710
All right, how many nodes do
we have at each level?

183
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,710
Well, at level 0 we
have only 1 node.

184
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,470
But what's the down
at the bottom?

185
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,350
Let's say we have an enormous
amount of weight so that in

186
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,430
fact we never run out of
weight in our knapsack.

187
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,650
We'll have quite a broad
tree, right?

188
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,220
How many nodes at level 2?

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,940
At each level, right?

190
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,430
Down here we have up
to 4 nodes, up to 8

191
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,270
nodes, up to 16 nodes.

192
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,920
So if we had say, 39, 40 items,
at level 39 we'd have 2

193
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,710
to the 39th nodes--

194
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,550
pretty darn big tree.

195
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,030
All right?

196
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,810
Not very deep, but very bushy.

197
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,420
So we know that for any
reasonable number of items and

198
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,030
a reasonable amount of
weight, this is just

199
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,620
not going to work.

200
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,920
And that's why when you wrote
your problem set, and you were

201
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,530
trying to solve the optimal set
of courses to take, you

202
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,320
could only run it on a small
subset of the courses at MIT.

203
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,520
Because if we gave you
everything-- and we gave you a

204
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,990
lot for a test--

205
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,960
you noticed it effectively
just wouldn't finish.

206
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,770
So now we have to ask the
question well, can we use

207
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,350
dynamic programming to
solve this problem?

208
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,320
And in particular, that boils
down to the question of does

209
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,360
this solution exhibit optimal
substructure and overlapping

210
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,610
subproblems?

211
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:29,050
Well, optimal substructure is
easily visible in both the

212
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,466
decision tree and the code.

213
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,280
Right?

214
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,950
Each parent node combines
the solution--

215
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,940
We can look at the code
since you have the

216
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,676
subtree in your handout--

217
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:43,650
or the decision tree
in your handout.

218
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,570
And the key place in the code is
where we combine decisions

219
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,610
from lower down in the
tree as we go up.

220
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,310
So at each parent node,
we select the

221
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,560
better of the two children.

222
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,780
Right?

223
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,250
If the left child is better
than the right child, we

224
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,090
select the left.

225
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,200
Otherwise, we select
the right.

226
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,700
And we just percolate
up the tree.

227
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,690
So there's clearly optimal
substructure here, that we can

228
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,735
solve the higher nodes with
solutions to the lower nodes.

229
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,830
And we see that again in the
code where it says choose

230
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,080
better branch.

231
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,400
It's less obvious to answer the
question whether or not

232
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,960
there are overlapping
subproblems.

233
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,850
If we go back and look
at the tree--

234
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,700
At first glance, it may appear
that there are no overlapping

235
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,100
subproblems.

236
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,240
You'll notice that at
each node we're

237
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,085
solving a different problem.

238
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:07,620
Right?

239
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,810
The problem is described in some
sense by this fortuple.

240
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,220
But if I've already taken A and
C, and I have D left to

241
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,200
consider, what should I do?

242
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,190
Where up here I've taken A, and
I have B, C, and D left to

243
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,320
consider, what should I do?

244
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,210
And by design of the decision
tree, each node is different.

245
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,540
Right?

246
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,350
We're not considering the same
thing over and over again.

247
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,900
So you might look at it and say,
well, we're out of luck.

248
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,230
There are no overlapping
subproblems.

249
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,360
Not true.

250
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,730
So let's think hard for a second
and ask in what sense

251
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,590
are there overlapping
subproblems?

252
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,830
When are we potentially,
at least,

253
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,080
solving the same problem?

254
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,785
Well what is the problem
we're actually solving?

255
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,990
We're solving the problem that
can in some sense be stated as

256
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:18,470
follows- at each node, we're
saying what should we do about

257
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,430
the nodes left to consider?

258
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,070
So we're solving a problem
given a set of items--

259
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,035
what items we have at a node.

260
00:16:41,080 --> 00:17:02,395
Given an available weight, which
items should we take?

261
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,905
What's missing from this?

262
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,170
It says nothing about the items
you've already taken.

263
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,050
In order to decide what to take
next, we need to know how

264
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,700
much weight we have available.

265
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,680
But we don't need to know why
we have that much weight

266
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,680
available, which items we have
previously decided to take.

267
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:53,080
That part of the for tuple turns
out not to be relevant

268
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,275
to the problem I still
have to solve.

269
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,810
Why is that important?

270
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,800
Because there may be many
different sets of items I

271
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,990
could take.

272
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,510
It would add up to the
same total weight.

273
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,680
Therefore, leaving me the
same problem to solve.

274
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,850
And that's the key observation
that tells us we can use

275
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,575
dynamic programming to solve
the 0-1 knapsack problem.

276
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,745
Does that--

277
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:33,910
I should ask the positive
question-- does that make

278
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,390
sense to anybody?

279
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,640
Raise your hand if
it makes sense--

280
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,940
a small number of hands.

281
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,780
Raise your hands if it
doesn't make sense.

282
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,360
OK.

283
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,980
Can any of you to whom
it doesn't make

284
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,385
sense formulate a question?

285
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,100
No, it's hard.

286
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,630
AUDIENCE: Total weight, or
the same total value?

287
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,360
PROFESSOR: The same
total weight.

288
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,560
Because--

289
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
the question is are there many
sets of items with the same

290
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,950
total value or the same
total weight?

291
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,100
There might be many with the
same total value, but that

292
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,560
doesn't really matter.

293
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Because in choosing what to do
next, as I go down the tree, I

294
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,670
don't care what the value
is above the tree.

295
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,130
Because I'll still try and find
the best solution I can

296
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,380
to the remaining subproblem.

297
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,830
If a value above is a million,
or the value above is 3, it

298
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,960
doesn't matter what
I should do next.

299
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:45,748
AUDIENCE: Which makes sense.

300
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:48,889
But if you use different things
to get that weight,

301
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:52,210
wouldn't you have a different
set of items to choose from?

302
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,110
PROFESSOR: Right.

303
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,610
So the question is it makes
sense if there are many

304
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,980
different sets of items that
would have the same total

305
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,230
weight, but what
I'm going to--

306
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,550
but, wouldn't I have different
items to choose from?

307
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,700
Well you'll notice that I
do have to look at what

308
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,990
items I have left.

309
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,810
But as I go through--

310
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:21,860
let's assume here that I have
a list of items to take.

311
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,760
As I go through from the front,
say, I'll label each

312
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,660
node of the tree.

313
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,950
Each item will have either a 0
or a 1, depending upon whether

314
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,800
I decided to take it or not.

315
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,140
And then what I have
to consider is

316
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,390
the remaining items.

317
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,410
And let's say the values of
the first two items--

318
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,320
the first four items--

319
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,340
were, well, let's say they were
all one, just to make

320
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,370
life simple.

321
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,420
Well that'll be confusing, since
I'm using that for taken

322
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,810
or not taken.

323
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,500
Let's say their values
were all 2.

324
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,290
When I get here, and I'm
deciding what to do with these

325
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:25,790
items, I might--

326
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,170
so this tells me that
I've used up 4

327
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,400
pounds of my allotment.

328
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
Right?

329
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,630
But if I had done this one, I
would also use up 4 pounds of

330
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,420
my allotment.

331
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,800
And so, which of these I take
or don't take is independent

332
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,790
of how I got here.

333
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,520
I do have to keep track of
which items are still

334
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,240
available to me.

335
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,465
But I don't care how I've
used up those 4 pounds.

336
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,380
And obviously, there are a lot
of ways to choose two that

337
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,950
will use up 4 pounds
here, right?

338
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,060
But the solution to this part
of the problem will be

339
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,180
independent of which
two I took.

340
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,600
That make sense now?

341
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,950
Therefore, as long as there is
a prefix of my list of items,

342
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,440
such that multiple things add up
to the same weight, I will

343
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,060
have overlapping subproblems.

344
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,000
Now you could imagine a
situation in which no

345
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,770
combination added to the same
weight, in which case dynamic

346
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,550
programming wouldn't
buy me anything.

347
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,500
It would still find the right
answer, but it wouldn't speed

348
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,660
anything up.

349
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,070
But in practice, for most 0-1
knapsack problems-- they may

350
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,660
not be this simple--

351
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,630
but you could expect--

352
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,920
and we'll see this complexity
later--

353
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,040
that as long as your possible
weights are being chosen from

354
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,070
a relatively small set, you'll
have many things add up to the

355
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,120
same thing--

356
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,050
particularly as you get further
down this list and

357
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,480
have a lot longer prefix
to consider.

358
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,900
So indeed I do have overlapping
subproblems.

359
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,850
That answer the question?

360
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,050
All right, now.

361
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,070
People feel better about
what's going on?

362
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,130
OK.

363
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,740
Maybe looking at some code
will make it even

364
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,920
clearer, and maybe not.

365
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,400
Anyway, I do appreciate
the questions.

366
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,810
Since it's sometimes hard for me
to appreciate what's coming

367
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,273
across and what's not
coming across.

368
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:56,070
You should get rewarded for
good questions, as well as

369
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,530
good answers.

370
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,880
All right, so now
let's look at a

371
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,803
dynamic programming solution.

372
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,015
I've just taken the
previously--

373
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:16,540
the example we looked at
before was solve--

374
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,700
made it fast solve.

375
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,550
And I've added a parameter
of memo.

376
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,330
This is the same kind of trick
we used last time for our

377
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,330
shortest path problem.

378
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,460
I should point out
that I'm using--

379
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,350
this calls to mind a dirty,
little secret of Python, one I

380
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,960
have previously been hiding
because it's so ugly I just

381
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,490
hate to talk about it.

382
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,840
But I figured at some point,
honesty is the right policy.

383
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,820
What I'd like is the first
time I call fast solve, I

384
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,660
shouldn't have to know that
there's even a memo.

385
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:06,910
Fast solve should have the
same interface as solve.

386
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,540
The items to consider and the
available weight, and that's

387
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,490
all you should need to know.

388
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,830
Because the memo is part of the
implementation, not part

389
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,510
of the specification
of solving the

390
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,690
0-1 knapsack problem.

391
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,910
We've made that argument
several times,

392
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,710
earlier in the semester.

393
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:34,370
And so you might think that what
I should therefore do is

394
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,920
to initialize the memo to,
say the empty dictionary.

395
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,150
I'm going to use dictionaries
for memos, as before.

396
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,140
And then just check and if it's
the empty one, that means

397
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,870
it's the first--

398
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,500
I can know whether it's
the-- it'll work fine

399
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,980
for the first call.

400
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,710
Well it doesn't work fine.

401
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,200
And here's the dirty,
little secret.

402
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,680
In Python, when you have a
parameter with a default

403
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,915
value, that default value
is evaluated once.

404
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,720
So the way the Python system
works is it will process all

405
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,020
of the def statements
and evaluate the

406
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,640
right-hand side here once.

407
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,630
And then every time the function
is called, without

408
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,700
this optional argument, it will
use the value it found

409
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,790
when it evaluated the
def statement.

410
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:44,790
Now if this value is immutable,
it doesn't matter.

411
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,970
None will be none forever.

412
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,830
28 will be 28 forever.

413
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,780
3.7 will be 3.7 forever.

414
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:59,030
But if this is a mutable value,
for example a dict,

415
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:05,330
then what will happen is it will
create an object which

416
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,150
will be initially an
empty dictionary.

417
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,510
But then every time fast solve
is called without this

418
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,865
argument, it will access
the same object.

419
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,420
So if I call fast solve to solve
one problem, and in the

420
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,910
course of that, it builds
up a big dictionary.

421
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,460
And then I call it again to
solve another problem, instead

422
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,280
of starting with the empty
dictionary, it will start with

423
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,150
the same object it started with
the first time, which is

424
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,150
by now a dictionary filled
with values.

425
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,275
And so I will get the
wrong answer.

426
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:00,020
This is a subtlety, and it's a
common kind of bug in Python.

427
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,670
And I confess to having been
bitten by it very recently, as

428
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,050
in yesterday, myself.

429
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,240
So it's worth remembering.

430
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,400
And there's a simple workaround,
which is the

431
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,840
default value is the
immutable value.

432
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,550
I chose none.

433
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,290
And what I say when I enter it
is if the memo is none, it

434
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,460
means it's been invoked.

435
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,580
And now I'll initialize it
to the empty dictionary.

436
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,060
And now every time it will get
a new one, because we know

437
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,790
what this statement says is
allocate a new object of type

438
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,700
dict, and initialize
it to empty.

439
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,880
This will happen dynamically
when the thing is invoked,

440
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,040
rather than statically
at the time Python

441
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,700
processes the diffs.

442
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,280
It's a silly little problem.

443
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,820
I hate to bring it up.

444
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,670
I don't think it should
work that way, but it

445
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,660
does work that way.

446
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,610
So we're stuck.

447
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:56,865
Yeah.

448
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,115
[INAUDIBLE]

449
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:00,730
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

450
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,680
You've have to speak
more loudly.

451
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,930
[INAUDIBLE]

452
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:10,870
PROFESSOR: Well, why doesn't
my first call--

453
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,890
So the question is when I go to
test it, say, why don't I

454
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,380
start by calling it with fast
solve in an empty dictionary?

455
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:28,170
And it's because, as we'll see
when I get there, I want solve

456
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:37,980
and fast solve, in this case,
to have the same interface.

457
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,250
And in fact, you can say I want
them to have the same

458
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,500
specification.

459
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,340
Because in fact, imagine that
you wrote a program that

460
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,070
called solve many times.

461
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,120
And it was slow, and then
you took 6.00--

462
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,250
So, I know why it's
slow, because I've

463
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,060
used a stupid solve.

464
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,270
Let me use dynamic
programming.

465
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,770
I want to then be able to not
name the new one fast solve,

466
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,380
but replace the old solve
by the new solve.

467
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,990
And have all the programs that
you solve still work.

468
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,450
That will not happen if I insist
that the new solve has

469
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,700
an extra argument.

470
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,395
Now I could put what's called
a wrapper in and call solve,

471
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:34,295
and then have it call fast solve
with the extra argument.

472
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,060
And that would work too.

473
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,230
That would be an equally
good solution to

474
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,710
address this problem.

475
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,630
But does that make sense?

476
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,020
So either one would work.

477
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,740
I chose this one but what
wouldn't work in a practical

478
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,630
engineering sense is to change
the specification of solve.

479
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,840
All right?

480
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,020
So it's a silly little thing,
but since people do get bitten

481
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,380
by it, I figure I should
tell you about it.

482
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,870
And I guess while I'm on the
subject of silly little

483
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,170
things, I'll tell you one more
thing before we go back to

484
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,570
this algorithm.

485
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:28,550
Down here in the place where
I'm testing it, you'll note

486
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,530
that I've imported something
called sys, and then said

487
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:38,040
sys.setrecursionlimit to 2000.

488
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,410
In Python, there's a maximum
depth of recursion.

489
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,980
When this is exceeded, it
raises an exception--

490
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,290
depth exceeded.

491
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,730
As it happens, the default
value for that

492
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,040
is some tiny number--

493
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,090
I forget what it is--

494
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,520
such that when I run this on an
interesting size example,

495
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,740
it crashes that exception.

496
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,070
So all I'm doing here
is saying no, I

497
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,390
know what I'm doing.

498
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,620
It's OK to recurse to
a greater depth.

499
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,270
And I've set it to 2000
here, which is

500
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,050
plenty for what I need.

501
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,390
I could set it to 20,000.

502
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,420
I could set it to 50,000.

503
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,940
Again, if you're writing a
serious program, you'll

504
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,490
probably find that the default
value for the depth of

505
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,410
recursion is not enough, and
you might want to reset it.

506
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,990
I don't expect you to remember
how to do this.

507
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,540
I expect you to remember
that it's possible.

508
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,460
And if you need to do it, you
can Google "recursion limit

509
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,350
Python" and it will tell
you how to change it.

510
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,790
But again, I've found
in testing this, the

511
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,455
default was too small.

512
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:52,670
Ok.

513
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,655
Let's go look at the code
now for fast solve.

514
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,860
It's got the items to consider,
what's available,

515
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,660
the available weight,
and a memo.

516
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,440
And I'm going to keep track
of the number of calls.

517
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,330
Just for pedagogical
reasons, we'll want

518
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,580
to review that later.

519
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,360
OK, so I'll initialize
the memo if it's

520
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,610
the first time through.

521
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,580
And then the first thing I'll do
is I'm going to code what I

522
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,520
have available essentially the
way I've coded it here-- so

523
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,850
what items are remaining
by using an index.

524
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,080
So my items are going to
be a set of lists.

525
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,910
And I'm going to just sort
of keep track of

526
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,310
where I am in the list--

527
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,510
just march through exactly the
way I'd marched through here.

528
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,380
And so if the list of
things to consider,

529
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
the length of it--

530
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,560
because every time the length
is the same, it

531
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,239
will be the same list.

532
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,690
Since I'm systematically
examining a prefix.

533
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm not shuffling the
list each time.

534
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,250
So the length can be used
to tell me what I've

535
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,420
already looked at.

536
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,139
So if I've looked at that
sublist before, with this

537
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,150
available weight, it will
be in the memo.

538
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,659
And I'll just look
up the solution--

539
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,480
result equals memo of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

540
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,980
to consider avail.

541
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,560
So those will be my keys
for my dictionary.

542
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,520
The key will be a pair of
essentially which items I have

543
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,900
left to consider, which is coded
by a number, and the

544
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,480
amount of weight,
another number.

545
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,190
Or if there's nothing left to
consider, or there's no weight

546
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:16,650
available, then I'll return
0 and the empty tuple--

547
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,595
no value, didn't
take anything.

548
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,810
Otherwise, I'm now in the
interesting case.

549
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:36,690
If to consider subzero, the
first one here, if the weight

550
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:44,990
of that is greater than what I
have available, then I know I

551
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,810
can't take it.

552
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,850
Right?

553
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:54,050
So I'll just lop it off and call
fast solve recursively

554
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,300
with the remaining list--

555
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,120
same old value of avail
and the same old memo.

556
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,850
Otherwise, well now I have an
option of taking the first

557
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,130
element in the list.

558
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,370
I'll set the item to that
element, and I'll

559
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,280
consider taking it.

560
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,040
So I'll call fast solve
with to consider

561
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,050
without the first item.

562
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,570
But the amount of weight will
be available now is what was

563
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,860
available before minus the
weight of that item.

564
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,000
This is my left branch,
if you will, where I

565
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,480
decide to take the item.

566
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,280
And so now I'm solving
a smaller problem.

567
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,580
The list is smaller, and
I have less weight.

568
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,440
The next thing I'll do is
consider not taking the item.

569
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,060
So I'll call fast solve
again with the

570
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,740
remainder of the list.

571
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,900
But avail and memo
are not changed.

572
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,610
That's the right branch.

573
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,500
And you'll remember our decision
tree the right branch

574
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,970
avail and weight were
never changed.

575
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,620
Because I elected not
to take that item.

576
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,330
Then I'll just choose the
better of the two

577
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,580
alternatives, as before.

578
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:27,420
And when I'm done, I'll update
the memo with the solution to

579
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,450
the problem I just solved.

580
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,190
All right?

581
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,740
So it's exactly the same as
the recursive solution you

582
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,190
looked at a few weeks ago.

583
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:46,620
Except I've added this notion
of a memo to keep track of

584
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,220
what we've already done.

585
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,695
Well let's see how
well it works.

586
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,270
So I've got this test program.

587
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:04,240
Just so things are repeatable,
I'd set the C to 0 --

588
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,810
doesn't matter what I set it to,
this just says instead of

589
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,540
getting a random value each
time, I'll get the same C so

590
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,520
I'll get the same sequence of
pseudo-random numbers--

591
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,770
makes it easier to debug.

592
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,660
I'll have this global
variable num calls.

593
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,260
I'm arbitrarily setting the
capacity to eight times the

594
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,960
maximum weight.

595
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,810
So I'm saying the maximum
value of an item is 10.

596
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,820
The maximum weight is 10.

597
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:41,020
This just says runs slowly is
false, as in don't run the

598
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,820
slow version.

599
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,990
Run only the fast version.

600
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,510
We'll come back to that.

601
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,740
I set the capacity of
the Knapsack to 8

602
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,950
times the max weight.

603
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,140
And then for the number of
items-- and I'm just going to

604
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,080
go through a different
number of items,

605
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,930
4, 8 16, up to 1024--

606
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,660
I'm going to call build
many items.

607
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,590
Again, we've seen this
program before.

608
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,340
That just takes a number of
items, a maximum value, and a

609
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:11,430
maximum weight, and builds some
set of items, choosing

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,670
the values and weights at random
from the ones we've

611
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,760
offered it.

612
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,550
This saves me.

613
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,360
I wasn't going to type a
set of 1024 items, I

614
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,610
guarantee you that.

615
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,290
If it runs slowly, then I'm
going to test it on both fast

616
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,130
solve and solve.

617
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,390
Notice that these are the names
of the functions, not

618
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,420
invocations of the functions.

619
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,850
Because remember functions,
like everything else in

620
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,640
Python, are just objects.

621
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,450
Otherwise, my tests will be
only the tuple fast solve.

622
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,930
And then for each function in
tests, I'm going to set the

623
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,530
number of calls to 0.

624
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,920
I'm going to load up a timer,
just because I'm curious how

625
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,790
long it takes.

626
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,340
And then I'll call the func.

627
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,570
Notice again, getting back to
what we talked about before,

628
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,420
both fast solve and
solve get called

629
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,690
with the same arguments.

630
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,290
I could not have done this
trick if fast solve had

631
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,550
required an extra parameter.

632
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,340
And then I'll just see
how well it did.

633
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:36,070
So let's start with this
equal to true.

634
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,070
So in that case we'll
test both of them.

635
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,320
And let's see how we do.

636
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,750
So it's chugging along.

637
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,980
And we see that if I have 4
items, fast solve made 29

638
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,350
calls, took this much time.

639
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,740
The good news, by the way,
you'll notice that fast solve

640
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,890
and solve gave me the same
value each time.

641
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,530
We would hope so, right?

642
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,640
Because they're both supposed
to find an optimal solution.

643
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,700
They could find different
sets of items.

644
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,890
That would be OK.

645
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,680
But they better add up
to the same value.

646
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,710
But we seem to be stuck here.

647
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,870
So you'll notice at 16,
Solve made 131,000

648
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,420
calls, fast solve 3,500--

649
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,440
only took a third of a second.

650
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,310
But we seem to be kind
of stuck at--

651
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,710
actually, fast solve
only made 1,200.

652
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,830
At 32, fast solve made
3,500 calls.

653
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,920
But solve seems to be stuck.

654
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,290
Should this be a shocker that
going from 16 to 32 made a big

655
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,900
difference?

656
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,860
Well remember here we're talking
about 2 to the 16

657
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,220
possibilities to investigate,
which is not a huge number.

658
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,060
But now we're at 2 to the 32,
which is quite a large number.

659
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,670
And so we could wait quite
a long time for solve to

660
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,780
actually finish.

661
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,290
And in fact, we're not going
to wait that long.

662
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,720
We'll interrupt it.

663
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,615
So let's see how well
fast solve works.

664
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,190
We just call that.

665
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,215
So we'll set this to false.

666
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:47,060
It says don't run slowly, i.e.

667
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,310
Don't call solve.

668
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,450
So not only did we not get stuck
at 32 items way up here,

669
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:10,650
we didn't get stuck
at 1024 items.

670
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,180
Huge difference, right?

671
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,680
Instead of only being able to
process a set of 16, we can

672
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,090
process a set of over 1,000.

673
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,160
And in fact, I don't know how
much higher we can go.

674
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,770
I didn't try anything bigger.

675
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,830
But even this--

676
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,690
big difference between getting
stuck here and not getting

677
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,490
stuck here.

678
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,360
And in fact, not only did
not get stuck, it

679
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,350
was only two seconds.

680
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,290
So let's ask ourselves
the question-- how

681
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,580
fast is this growing?

682
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,220
Not very fast--

683
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,410
more or less, what we see
here-- and this is not

684
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,540
something we can guarantee.

685
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,290
But in this case, what we see is
as we double the number of

686
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:01,000
items, the number of calls
kind of doubles as well.

687
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,520
So we're actually growing
pretty slowly.

688
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,400
Well, OK that's good.

689
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,360
But suppose we want to look at
it a little bit more carefully

690
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,370
and consider the question of
what does govern the running

691
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,620
time of fast solve.

692
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,690
Well we know that looking
things up in the dict is

693
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,270
constant time.

694
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,250
So that's OK.

695
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,850
So what's going to govern it is
every time we have to add

696
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,400
an element to the memo, it's
going to slow us down.

697
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,250
Because you're gonna have
to solve a problem.

698
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,690
Every time we can just look
something up in the memo,

699
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,445
we'll get our answer back
instantaneously.

700
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,060
So if we think about the running
time, it's going to be

701
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:11,110
related to how many different
key value pairs might we have

702
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,630
to compute for the memo.

703
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,680
Well what governs that?

704
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,390
So we know that the keys in
the memo are pairs of to

705
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:29,040
consider and avail.

706
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:41,300
And so we know that the number
of possible different keys

707
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,960
will be the number of possible
values in to consider,

708
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,400
multiplied by the number of
possible values of avail.

709
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,650
Right?

710
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,150
How many possible values of
to consider are there?

711
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,530
What governs that?

712
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,830
That's the easy question.

713
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,420
Number of items, right?

714
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:21,280
Because I'm just marching across
this list, chopping off

715
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,200
one item at a time.

716
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,510
At most I can chop off
n items, if the list

717
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,760
is of length n.

718
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,270
Avail is more complicated.

719
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,890
What does avail depend upon?

720
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,950
It depends upon, well, the
initial available weight.

721
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:55,000
If the initial available weight
is 0, well then it's

722
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,340
gonna end really quickly.

723
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:04,640
If it's really big, I might
have to churn longer.

724
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,160
But it also depends--

725
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,860
and this is the key thing--

726
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:33,470
on the number of different
weights, that sets of items

727
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,720
can add up to.

728
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,950
Because you'll recall the whole
secret here was that we

729
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,770
said that different sets of
items could actually have the

730
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,270
same total weight.

731
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:57,390
And that's why we had this
business of overlapping

732
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,640
subproblems.

733
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:08,660
Now here, since I only had 10
possible weights, that tells

734
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,240
me that I can't have very many
different combinations.

735
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,960
Right?

736
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,510
That any set of say, one item
has to be 0 through 10, or 0

737
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,970
through 9, I forget
which it was.

738
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,370
But either way, that means
that alI only have 10

739
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:36,690
different possible sums
for sets of length 1.

740
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,270
Whereas if my weights ranged
over 100, I would have 100

741
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:45,000
different possibilities
for sets of length 1.

742
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,410
So that's an important factor
in governing it.

743
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,620
So it's a complicated situation,
but just to see

744
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:09,110
what happens, try and remember
how long this took for 1024.

745
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,600
It took 2.2 seconds.

746
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,036
I'm going to allow 20
different weights.

747
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,690
And let's see what happens.

748
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,020
It took roughly twice as long.

749
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,880
So that's sort of what we
would have expected.

750
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,640
So again, we're going to
see the running time

751
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,770
is related to that.

752
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,340
So we can see that
it's actually a

753
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,650
fairly complicated thing.

754
00:49:51,650 --> 00:50:02,680
Suppose I did something really
nasty and went up here where I

755
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,930
built my items--

756
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,890
so here you'll see, when I built
my items I chose the

757
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,850
weight between 1
and max weight.

758
00:50:25,945 --> 00:50:28,490
And these were all integers--

759
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,110
ints.

760
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,765
Suppose instead of
that, I do this.

761
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,780
So here after I choose my value
between 1 and 10, I'm

762
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,040
going to multiply it by some
random number between 0 and 1.

763
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,520
We've all seen random.random.

764
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,770
So now how many possible
different weights

765
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,020
am I going to have?

766
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,900
A huge number, right?

767
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:17,680
The number of random numbers,
real floats between 0 and 1 is

768
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,540
close to infinite, right?

769
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,030
And so in fact, now I'm going
to see that with reasonable

770
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:30,480
probability, every single item
will have a different weight.

771
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,530
And so, things adding up to the
same could still happen,

772
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,840
even if they're all different.

773
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,840
But it's not very probable.

774
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,750
So let's see what happens
when I run it now.

775
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,690
It's slowing down
pretty quickly.

776
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,420
Pretty much where the other
one stopped right?

777
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,240
Remember we got through
16 with Slowsolve

778
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,450
but not through 32?

779
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,860
Because effectively, I've now
reduced the fast solve to the

780
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,020
same as solve.

781
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,100
It will never find anything
in the memo, so it's doing

782
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,980
exactly the same amount of
work that solve did.

783
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,430
And it will run very slowly.

784
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,850
OK, life is hard.

785
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:28,170
But this is what you'd expect,
because deep down we know the

786
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:33,640
0-1 knapsack problem is
exponential, inherently

787
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,180
exponential.

788
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,450
And while I think dynamic
programming is kind of

789
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:43,180
miraculous how well it usually
works, it's not miraculous in

790
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,960
the liturgical sense, right?

791
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,060
It's not actually performing
a miracle in solving an

792
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,140
exponential problem
in linear time.

793
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,920
It can in all things go bad.

794
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,270
The exponential, and that's
what it is here.

795
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,100
This kind of algorithm is called
pseudo-polynomial.

796
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,380
It kind of runs in polynomial
time, but not when things are

797
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,630
really bad.

798
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,960
And I won't go into the details
of pseudo-polynomial,

799
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,630
but if any of you are in Course
6, you'll hear about it

800
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:25,040
in 6.006 and 6.046.

801
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,920
OK, we can adjourn.

802
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,170
I'll see you all on Thursday.

803
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,710
And we're not going to
wait for this to

804
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,960
finish, because it won't.
