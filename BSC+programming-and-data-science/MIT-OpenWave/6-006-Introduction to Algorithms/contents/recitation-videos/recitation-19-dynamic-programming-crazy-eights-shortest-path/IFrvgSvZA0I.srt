8
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:22,890
PROFESSOR: OK, so
up until now, we've

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,371
been talking about the
shortest path in graphs.

10
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:28,370
And we've been talking
about these game problems

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:34,260
where you came up with a way to
represent the state of a game

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,240
as noting graphs.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,400
And then we drew edges between
those vertices that represented

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,210
states, to represent moves
that you can do in a game.

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,500
It turns out you can solve
a lot of problems this way.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,650
And you can do it without
thinking of a graph at all.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,482
So we usually think of a
graph, build the graph,

18
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:51,690
then run dynamic programming.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,550
You can do better without
building the graph.

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,260
And the good part about that
is that your code is smaller,

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,630
and it runs faster.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,510
The bad part about that is
it's harder to understand.

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,260
The dynamic programming
code looks like black magic.

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,420
And, when we're going to
give you dynamic programming

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,129
problems on the final,
you can't say, oh,

26
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,378
we're going to build something
and run [? dystring ?].

27
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,460
And get partial credit.

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,970
You actually have to
understand the magic,

29
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,360
and write the formulas,
and hopefully get

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,790
something that works.

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,090
So, we're going to spend all
the time that we have left

32
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,640
in the semester, I
think, building up

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,360
your intuition for how to
build dynamic programming.

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,040
So, from lecture,
dynamic programming

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,659
is just a catchy name for
for optimization problems.

36
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,450
So, problems where
you're trying to compute

37
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,740
the minimum or the
maximum of something.

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,140
So let's start with a problem.

39
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,190
And then, see how all
the concepts in lecture

40
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,290
relate to that.

41
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,650
So this problem is
called Crazy Eights.

42
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,030
And we start out with a deck
of cards, randomly shuffled.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,310
And then some of the
cards are pulled out.

44
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,050
Did everyone see playing cards?

45
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,520
Poker cards?

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,420
Does everyone know what they
are or do I have to define them?

47
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,740
Does anyone need me
to define poker cards?

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,210
Let's put it that way.

49
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,740
OK.

50
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,639
Cool.

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,270
So, suppose we have
a bunch of these.

52
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,112
AUDIENCE: I don't know
what Crazy Eights is.

53
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,320
PROFESSOR: We'll get to that.

54
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,450
AUDIENCE: OK.

55
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,384
It's an 8.

56
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:23,884
AUDIENCE: I know
what an 8 is, but I

57
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:24,880
don't know how the game works.

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,140
PROFESSOR: OK.

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,930
We'll get to it.

60
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,000
So, let's see.

61
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,880
4 of spades.

62
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,354
OK, so this is a
bunch of cards that

63
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:59,520
were pulled out of the deck.

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,660
And we want the longest
crazy subsequence.

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,670
And the crazy subsequence
is a subsequence

66
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,090
where two cards are
like each other.

67
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,370
The way we define like
is that either they

68
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,370
have the same number.

69
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,480
Or they have the same suit.

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,700
Or one of them is an 8.

71
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
So an 8 is like anything else.

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,660
OK.

73
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,650
So 4 and 8.

74
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,172
Are they like each other?

75
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,960
AUDIENCE: Yes.

76
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,610
PROFESSOR: 8 and 5.

77
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,055
Are they like each other?

78
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,677
AUDIENCE: Yep.

79
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:44,260
PROFESSOR: OK.

80
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,470
this 5, 5 of hearts
and 9 of diamonds.

81
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,210
Are they like each other?

82
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,610
No.

83
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,649
5 of hearts and 7 of hearts.

84
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:57,690
Are they like each other?

85
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,200
AUDIENCE: Yes.

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,000
PROFESSOR: 5 of spades and 7
of hearts, like each other?

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,500
No.

88
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,330
OK.

89
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,600
So we have some cards
that are like each other.

90
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,850
We want the longest
possible subsequence.

91
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,058
AUDIENCE: What about 5 and 5?

92
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,240
Those are like each other.

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,064
PROFESSOR: They're
like each other, yep.

94
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:17,480
They are more cards that are
like each other than the ones

95
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,070
I drew here.

96
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,263
For example, this guy
is like everything else.

97
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,742
Oh, we already drew that one.

98
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,440
OK.

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,880
So how do we model this
problem using graphs?

100
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,310
So, stuff that we knew
before the last lecture.

101
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,997
AUDIENCE: Those
could all be nodes.

102
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:38,580
PROFESSOR: OK.

103
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,579
All the cards are nodes.

104
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,180
That's good.

105
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,860
And, I want the longest
path between what and what?

106
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:52,917
AUDIENCE: One node to another?

107
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,500
PROFESSOR: OK.

108
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,930
AUDIENCE: The longest
path in the graph.

109
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,250
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

110
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,750
The longest path in the graph.

111
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,510
One trick to reduce
it to a known problem

112
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,880
is to add the fake source.

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,084
So this is a fake source.

114
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,750
And it's going to
connect to everything.

115
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,650
And this way, I want the longest
path, starting from the source.

116
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,564
AUDIENCE: And the other source?

117
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:20,230
PROFESSOR: Nope.

118
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,688
The longest path, starting from
the source, ending anywhere

119
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,992
in the graph.

120
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,684
AUDIENCE: Such that it doesn't
go touch another card again?

121
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:29,350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

122
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,860
So, if I want a
longer subsequence,

123
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,818
that's a good question.

124
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:33,884
How would the edges look?

125
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:34,785
AUDIENCE: Directed.

126
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:35,410
PROFESSOR: Yep.

127
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,020
Directed.

128
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,570
And which direction?

129
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:43,140
AUDIENCE: Arbitrary [INAUDIBLE].

130
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,350
PROFESSOR: So, if I choose
this one and this one,

131
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,691
can I go back afterwards?

132
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,440
AUDIENCE: You just
can't go back to the 4.

133
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,481
PROFESSOR: So, in the
longest common subsequence,

134
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,390
all the cards have to
be in increasing order.

135
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,360
So I can say I'm going to
choose this one, this one,

136
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,420
and this one.

137
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,150
And they have to
match in this order.

138
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,950
So I can only go forward.

139
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,490
So I can't reorder the cards.

140
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:13,270
My answer has to be, say, 4
of diamonds, 8 of diamonds.

141
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,890
And then, what else
would match that?

142
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,500
9 of diamonds.

143
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,400
AUDIENCE: You can put the
8 anywhere, though, right?

144
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,983
PROFESSOR: No.

145
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:21,180
I can't move them.

146
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,249
So the cards have to be
in the initial order.

147
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,790
I don't have to
choose all the cards,

148
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,581
but the cards that I
choose have to respect

149
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,674
the initial ordering.

150
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,290
AUDIENCE: So everything
points right.

151
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,900
PROFESSOR: Everything
points right.

152
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,762
Forward.

153
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:32,262
Yep.

154
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,891
And, I need one more
edge from here to here.

155
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,641
AUDIENCE: Oh, so you're
saying in the game

156
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,170
you get an initial order.

157
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,580
And you can't reorder it.

158
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

159
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,350
But otherwise I can, if
I have all the cards,

160
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,610
I'm just going to order them.

161
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,592
AUDIENCE: Well, that's
the point right?

162
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:57,720
I was picturing more like
you get a set of cards

163
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
and you try to figure out--

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,780
PROFESSOR: No.

165
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,260
So, that's a different game.

166
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,860
That might be harder to solve,
so let's stick with this.

167
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,607
Yes?

168
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:08,140
AUDIENCE: Why is 8
in there, with 7?

169
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,640
PROFESSOR: 8 is
similar to anything.

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,467
Just for the heck of it.

171
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,300
These are the rules.

172
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,900
OK, so we have a
graph and we want

173
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,360
to compute the longest path.

174
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,250
We do not have an algorithm
to compute the longest path.

175
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,480
We only have algorithms
to compute shortest paths.

176
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,710
So how do I deal with that?

177
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,928
We had that in problem set six.

178
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,386
AUDIENCE: Make all
weights negative

179
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,957
because there's no
cycle [INAUDIBLE].

180
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:35,540
PROFESSOR: OK.

181
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,980
We know it's negative.

182
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,370
And, I guess these
ones don't matter.

183
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,870
But all these are going
to be, instead of being 1,

184
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,190
they're all going to be -1.

185
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,070
Very good.

186
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,520
And there are no
cycles in this graph,

187
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,391
so we know that the answer
will be well defined.

188
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:51,890
OK.

189
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,780
Everyone with me so far?

190
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,480
Happy nods?

191
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,590
Yes.

192
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,952
So, what algorithm do I know
that solves this problem?

193
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:01,910
AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford.

194
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,690
PROFESSOR: Bellman-Ford.

195
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,190
Good.

196
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,290
What is the running
time of Bellman-Ford?

197
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

198
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,420
PROFESSOR: Cool.

199
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,400
Suppose I have N cards.

200
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,585
How many vertices do I have?

201
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

202
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,440
PROFESSOR: Plus the source.

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,350
It's ordering.

204
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,740
So you're right.

205
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,010
How many edges do I have?

206
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,616
Worst case.

207
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:35,530
AUDIENCE: N squared.

208
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,382
PROFESSOR: Yep.

209
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:42,080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you mean,
like, the directed [INAUDIBLE]?

210
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,650
PROFESSOR: No, I
mean Bellman-Ford.

211
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,358
Then, we're going to
go to that algorithm

212
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,500
and get the better running time.

213
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,647
AUDIENCE: Cause isn't
Bellman-Ford e times e?

214
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,230
PROFESSOR: Oh.

215
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,625
What?

216
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

217
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's what
I-- Did someone say, v plus e?

218
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,210
Or did I write v plus e?

219
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,710
Yep.

220
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,290
You did.

221
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,776
Thank you.

222
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:03,670
So it's v times e.

223
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,662
So the total running time is.

224
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:12,092
aUDIENCE: N squared.

225
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,064
aUDIENCE: N cubed.

226
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:13,980
AUDIENCE: Or, n cubed.

227
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,952
Yeah, it's multiplying
[INAUDIBLE], too.

228
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:20,120
PROFESSOR: You guys
are mean today.

229
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,490
OK, so n cubed
applying Bellman-Ford.

230
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,440
There is a better way of
solving this problem, right?

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,630
The Directed Acyclic
Graph Bellman-Ford.

232
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,950
So let's look at the Directed
Acyclic Graph, not the one

233
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,600
to be generated by this because
that might be a bit messy.

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,225
And let's try to
compute shortest path.

235
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,410
s, a, b, c.

236
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,860
OK, so let's see
how we'd compute

237
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,690
the shortest path in this graph.

238
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,570
It's Acyclic, right?

239
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,467
All the the edges are
pointing downwards.

240
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,050
So let's try to
compute them directly.

241
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm not going to write
pseudocode first.

242
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm going to write
the formulas, and that

243
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,050
will get the intuition for it.

244
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,240
Then, maybe right psuedocode.

245
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,066
So what is the distance
from the source to itself?

246
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

247
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,020
PROFESSOR: Good.

248
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,820
The first ones are easy, so
I'm going to do them myself.

249
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,110
sa is 1.

250
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,010
sb is 2.

251
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,440
sc is 3.

252
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,360
And, of course, you guys
get to do the hard ones.

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,155
So the distance
from s to d is what?

254
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:08,702
How would I compute it?

255
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,510
AUDIENCE: There's two paths
to get to [INAUDIBLE].

256
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,630
PROFESSOR: OK.

257
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,740
So, I would want the shortest
path from those, right?

258
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,240
OK.

259
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,960
So it's 4.

260
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,700
And the formula for it is the
minimum of two paths, right?

261
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] S
to b, and then b to b.

262
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,740
PROFESSOR: So, one path is--

263
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,658
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and s [? and b ?].

264
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:33,424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

265
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:34,090
PROFESSOR: Wait.

266
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,420
sa.

267
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,930
So, first there's
a path from s to a.

268
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,020
And the edge a to d.

269
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,140
And then, there's
a path from s to b.

270
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,170
And the 8 from b to d, right?

271
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,550
And I already know the
values for sa and sb,

272
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,550
so this is well defined.

273
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,540
We can compute it right away.

274
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,150
No recursion.

275
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,330
No metrics.

276
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,960
I mean, there's recursion, but
there's no infinite recursion.

277
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,060
Does this make sense?

278
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,095
So, in order to get to d, there
are two edges pointing into d.

279
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,180
One of them coming from a.

280
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,470
One of them coming from b.

281
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,620
So I can either get to
a and take this edge.

282
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,249
Or get to b and take this edge.

283
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:20,790
This is what the
formulas are saying.

284
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,745
How about se?s
What's the formula?

285
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:36,170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

286
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,190
PROFESSOR: OK.

287
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,520
What are they?

288
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,546
AUDIENCE: s3.

289
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:44,506
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sa, sb, sc.

290
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,422
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

291
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:45,922
Aed's.

292
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,510
PROFESSOR: And the number?

293
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:07,010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 3?

294
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,510
I think.

295
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,680
e to e.

296
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,682
PROFESSOR: OK.

297
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:14,182
f.

298
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,500
Someone that hasn't
spoken today.

299
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,550
So that I can see
that everyone gets it.

300
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,360
Please.

301
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,807
AUDIENCE: dsb--

302
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,390
PROFESSOR: OK.

303
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,540
AUDIENCE: --plus wef.

304
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,850
PROFESSOR: OK.

305
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:42,030
AUDIENCE: And dsc plus wcf.

306
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,440
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

307
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,386
And that is--

308
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:46,257
PROFESSOR: 4.

309
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,840
PROFESSOR: I'll take
your word for it.

310
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,460
OK, so now the last one.

311
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,836
Distance from std.

312
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:05,250
AUDIENCE: 5.

313
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,640
Wait.

314
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,140
No.

315
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,676
PROFESSOR: So, let's
write a formula.

316
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:14,654
AUDIENCE: Oh, g, not a.

317
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,445
AUDIENCE: That's 5.

318
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:16,225
AUDIENCE: 5.

319
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,850
PROFESSOR: OK, so
let's write a formula

320
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,641
to make sure that you
guys are computing it

321
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,570
in the fastest
possible way for me.

322
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,800
So--

323
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,860
sd plus sd to g.

324
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:30,630
PROFESSOR: OK.

325
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,760
Does anyone else?

326
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,840
Is this the only path?

327
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,166
AUDIENCE: No.

328
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,570
There's more.

329
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,325
PROFESSOR: OK.

330
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,126
AUDIENCE: Plus e as to f.

331
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:45,334
PROFESSOR: Plus e as f.

332
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:46,000
AUDIENCE: And n.

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,437
AUDIENCE: c to f.

334
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:48,210
I mean, c to g.

335
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,140
Or, No. no.

336
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,937
s to c.

337
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:52,520
PROFESSOR: OK.

338
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,390
See, there's a trick.

339
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:53,889
OK.

340
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:54,970
Cool.

341
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,476
And then, what are the weights?

342
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:01,200
AUDIENCE: w e to g.

343
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,950
PROFESSOR: e to g.

344
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,650
Very good.

345
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,457
AUDIENCE: fg.

346
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:04,040
PROFESSOR: fg.

347
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,792
AUDIENCE: cg.

348
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:06,375
PROFESSOR: cg.

349
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,797
AUDIENCE: Why are
you adding in c?

350
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,380
AUDIENCE: Because
there's the extra c.

351
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,713
AUDIENCE: Oh, I didn't see that.

352
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,339
PROFESSOR: So, the point of this
guy's, is that if you do bfs,

353
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,130
you'll get tricked.

354
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,730
Because bfs would put g on
the same level as these.

355
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,450
And might compute
the value for g

356
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,144
before it has the
values for these.

357
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,650
OK, so what order do I need
to compute these numbers in,

358
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,585
for this to work?

359
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:47,940
AUDIENCE: That way
you computed them?

360
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,701
PROFESSOR: So, that is a, that
is a, something of the graph.

361
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:54,200
Yeah.

362
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,360
AUDIENCE: Oh, topological.

363
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,026
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

364
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,100
Stole your answer.

365
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,710
Topological sort.

366
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,330
So, any of the
topological sorts works.

367
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,800
The one we used this
time is sabcdefg.

368
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,383
Why am I using a
topological sort?

369
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:19,230
AUDIENCE: Because
there's dependency.

370
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,350
PROFESSOR: Yep.

371
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,700
So, this depends on
this and this, right?

372
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,880
As c depends on sa, as b as c.

373
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,225
So basically, every edge
here indicates a dependency.

374
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,600
In order to compute the shortest
distance from the source

375
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
to here, I need to
know the shortest

376
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,630
distance from the
source to these two.

377
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,650
And then I can
look at the edges.

378
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,725
So, the nice thing
about a topological sort

379
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,850
is, after I write the
vertices this way,

380
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,470
all the edges point forward.

381
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,680
Right? s to a. s to b.

382
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,285
s to c.

383
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,150
a to d.

384
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,492
a to e.

385
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,125
b to d.

386
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,470
b to e.

387
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,970
b to f.

388
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,740
I can keep going.

389
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,440
But the point is, there's no
such thing as a backward edge.

390
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,339
So if I compute the numbers in
this order, when I get to se,

391
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,180
I know that I computed the
distance from s to abcd.

392
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,800
And if I have any
edge coming into e,

393
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,280
I know that I've already
computed the shortest distance

394
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,829
to the node that
it is coming from.

395
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,109
yes?

396
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,950
Did I lose you guys?

397
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,230
Was this too--

398
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,750
AUDIENCE: So
basically, like, at a,

399
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,560
you relaxed all the
edges going out of it.

400
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,200
PROFESSOR: You can
look at it that way.

401
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,350
But what we're doing here
is I'm looking at a node

402
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,000
and I'm relaxing all the
edges coming into a node.

403
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,027
AUDIENCE: OK.

404
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,610
PROFESSOR: So this
matches this order.

405
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,327
AUDIENCE: OK.

406
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,410
PROFESSOR: What you said
doesn't match this order.

407
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,710
But it's exactly the same thing.

408
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,030
AUDIENCE: Oh.

409
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,780
PROFESSOR: It'll give
you the same result.

410
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,790
AUDIENCE: You'd get the first
value at g when you reach c.

411
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,565
But, like, end up
with the same answer.

412
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:55,190
PROFESSOR: Yep.

413
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,709
AUDIENCE: We're still going
backwards then, instead of--

414
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:00,750
PROFESSOR: As long as
you're processing the nodes

415
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,010
in the topological sort
order, all the algorithms

416
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,190
will work because
you're just computing

417
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,880
these terms in a
different order.

418
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,450
But as long as the
dependencies are satisfied,

419
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,330
you're still going to
get the right thing.

420
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,079
OK, so what's the
running time of this?

421
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,620
How many people know
the running time

422
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,030
without having to write
pseudocode for this?

423
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,601
I know the answer beforehand,
so I cheated, obviously.

424
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:27,100
OK.

425
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,570
AUDIENCE: Is it a?

426
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,600
[INAUDIBLE] edges.

427
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,350
PROFESSOR: Almost.

428
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,981
Very close.

429
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:31,814
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

430
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,250
PROFESSOR: So, it's
the topological.

431
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,100
So, running time
plus the running time

432
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,110
for evaluating this.

433
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,740
The running time for evaluating
this is v plus e because you

434
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,200
have every h shows up
exactly once in here.

435
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,510
So you have e terms.

436
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,130
And you have v vertices, even
if you don't have any edge,

437
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,160
you have to initialize
the verdicts.

438
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,473
So that's why it's v plus e.

439
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:00,630
AUDIENCE: It's also
topological sort.

440
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,350
PROFESSOR: So, this is the
order in which we process this.

441
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,850
So everything is v plus e.

442
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,740
If we use this algorithm
to solve this problem,

443
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,317
what will the running time be?

444
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,480
AUDIENCE: n.

445
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,970
AUDIENCE: n squared.

446
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,845
AUDIENCE: It's an no.

447
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:21,320
PROFESSOR: So, it's v
prime plus u prime, which

448
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:31,810
is n squared plus [INAUDIBLE]
squared, which is n squared.

449
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,840
So, by observing that
this graph is acyclic,

450
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,410
we have a better running
time than Bellman-Ford.

451
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,200
Even though we used
exactly the same intuition

452
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,400
that we used up until now.

453
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,020
Model the problem as a graph.

454
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,040
Figure out what the edges are.

455
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,980
Run a shortest path algorithm.

456
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,900
We have a better
shortest path algorithm,

457
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,940
which works for
Directed Acyclic Graphs,

458
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,810
so we get a better running time.

459
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,590
OK, questions for
what we did so far?

460
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,360
AUDIENCE: It's [INAUDIBLE]
on this graph here,

461
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,560
then you would do
the same thing.

462
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,580
Take each node and then
relax the incoming edges.

463
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

464
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,288
So what is the
topological sort of this?

465
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
PROFESSOR: It's exactly
the cards in the order

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,740
that they're on
the board, right?

468
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,050
So, in dynamic programming,
the topological sort order

469
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,690
is obvious.

470
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,760
So the hard part is
representing the state

471
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,730
and figuring out what
the dependencies are.

472
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,700
So what the edges are.

473
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,329
And after that, the
topological sort usually comes,

474
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:40,495
it's fairly straightforward.

475
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,910
OK, so what we can do now,
we have a few directions

476
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,239
in which we can go.

477
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,780
We can write the
pseudocode for this.

478
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,100
I mean, it's
basically, it's just,

479
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,900
we're going to write abstract
things instead of this.

480
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,240
So we're going to write one
piece of pseudocode that

481
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,500
evaluates these.

482
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,470
So it's just
generalizing this thing.

483
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,420
Something else we
can do is we can

484
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,790
look at how would these things
get computed using memoization?

485
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:28,215
We can look at how we would
compute shortest path in graphs

486
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:29,270
with cycles.

487
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,960
So this assumes we have a DAG.

488
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,920
What if we have cycles?

489
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,560
How do we deal with them?

490
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,380
Or we can do another DP problem,
and see how we'd model that.

491
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,160
So, votes?

492
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,590
What do people want to see?

493
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,420
I think we might have time for
two things, out of these four.

494
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,360
So, everyone votes for one.

495
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,490
And we'll start with that.

496
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,442
Sorry?

497
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:55,161
AUDIENCE: DP problem.

498
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:56,910
PROFESSOR: OK, so one
vote for DP problem.

499
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

500
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,832
PROFESSOR: OK.

501
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:00,540
AUDIENCE: Cyclic.

502
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,725
AUDIENCE: Wait, you
got two or one votes?

503
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:06,440
PROFESSOR: One vote.

504
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,690
AUDIENCE: OK.

505
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,190
I'll DP.

506
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,576
AUDIENCE: I'll stick
with [INAUDIBLE].

507
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,990
AUDIENCE: DP.

508
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,811
PROFESSOR: I think
we're done here.

509
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:15,310
All right.

510
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,370
So, new DP problem.

511
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,760
So, suppose you have something
like Manhattan's map, which

512
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,210
is basically a lattice.

513
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,830
Fancy math term for a grid.

514
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,085
And suppose it we can
only go forward and down.

515
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,090
So, all the streets are
one way because they

516
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,420
liked how people drive
in San Francisco,

517
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,545
and decided they're going
to do the same craziness.

518
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,520
So, we want to go from s to t.

519
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,590
And there are different
cost on all these edges.

520
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,450
This is an n by m matrix.

521
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,660
And I want to get from s to t
in the shortest possible way.

522
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,420
So, let's model the problem.

523
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,784
And then let's do
recursion formulas

524
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,200
and make it look like a DP
instead of like a graph problem

525
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,220
because-- it might be
too easy of a graph

526
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,397
problem in hindsight.

527
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:38,730
OK, so what's the graph problem?

528
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,135
AUDIENCE: It's not equivalent.

529
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,260
AUDIENCE: Topological sort.

530
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,647
And then bfs.

531
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:45,230
PROFESSOR: OK.

532
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,180
Topological sort.

533
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,340
And then, and then that.

534
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,530
Well, let's write
this as, let's say

535
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,890
that each node is so let's say
that the nodes have numbers,

536
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,390
right?

537
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:03,980
So this is 1,1 and this is 5,4.

538
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,566
And I want to write
this using math, so 2,1.

539
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,470
3,1.

540
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,898
4,1.

541
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:13,600
5,1.

542
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,420
And then, 1,2.

543
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,575
1,3.

544
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,440
1,4.

545
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,170
OK, so this is the graph.

546
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,020
The shortest path from
here to here is obvious.

547
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,516
By the way, this
is a real problem

548
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:29,140
for people who don't
see the connection

549
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,950
between dynamic
programming and graphs.

550
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,900
I This problem has tripped
up people on exams before.

551
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,320
So it's not a toy problem.

552
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:39,415
OK.

553
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:40,981
AUDIENCE: So, on an
examine, would you

554
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,290
have the option of just using
a straight up graph algorithm--

555
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,410
PROFESSOR: Well, we're going to
ask you to solve this using DP.

556
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,380
So let's try to solve this using
dynamic programming by writing

557
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,430
recursion formulas.

558
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:58,590
So, what's the shortest
distance to 1,1.

559
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,157
AUDIENCE: 0.

560
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:01,990
PROFESSOR: OK, then.

561
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,390
If I have a general distance,
if I have some random node here,

562
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,478
dij, how do I compute this?

563
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:11,430
AUDIENCE: It's a
minimum distance

564
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,310
between the distance
of law plus weights.

565
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,790
AUDIENCE: Or the distance of j.

566
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,307
i minus one.

567
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:19,806
Yeah.

568
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,100
PROFESSOR: So, i minus 1 j.

569
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

570
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,380
We get it.

571
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,645
Plus the weight of the, yeah.

572
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:35,308
AUDIENCE: Going from
one to the other.

573
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:40,380
PROFESSOR: OK, so the weight
from i minus 1 j to ij.

574
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,440
OK.

575
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,490
And?

576
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,000
AUDIENCE: j minus 1i.

577
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,030
For i, j minus 1.

578
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,495
PROFESSOR: ij minus 1.

579
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:58,184
AUDIENCE: Plus
weight of that ij.

580
00:25:58,184 --> 00:26:01,537
ij minus j1 to ij.

581
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:04,900
ij [INAUDIBLE]

582
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,904
PROFESSOR: OK.

583
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:07,070
So these are the recursions.

584
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,450
Now, how would I write the
full set of code for this?

585
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,713
So what's a valid topological
sort for these guys?

586
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:16,296
AUDIENCE: 1,1.

587
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:16,796
2,1.

588
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:18,220
3,1.

589
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,182
AUDIENCE: Dials.

590
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:20,144
AUDIENCE: 1,2.

591
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,550
AUDIENCE: The right dials.

592
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,270
PROFESSOR: That's going
to be hard to code.

593
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,735
That's going to be easy to code.

594
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,110
So I'm going to
take your answer.

595
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,425
AUDIENCE: OK.

596
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:28,740
AUDIENCE: What?

597
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,420
PROFESSOR: I'm not going to take
your answer because your answer

598
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,148
is correct, but
it's hard to code.

599
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:34,590
AUDIENCE: But isn't that
the same thing [INAUDIBLE]?

600
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,080
PROFESSOR: She
says, go like this.

601
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,621
AUDIENCE: Oh.

602
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:37,620
Oh.

603
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,850
PROFESSOR: So, here's how
I'm going to code them.

604
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,746
4i in 1,2n.

605
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:50,695
4j in 1 to m.

606
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:01,260
So, I guess, first off, if i
is 1 and j is 1, then d of ij

607
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,020
is 0, right?

608
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,490
This is the base case.

609
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:12,140
Otherwise, d of ij
equals big bad formula

610
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,070
that we have up there.

611
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:17,790
OK.

612
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,030
Do we need anything else?

613
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,464
AUDIENCE: DP.

614
00:27:21,464 --> 00:27:22,380
PROFESSOR: This is DP.

615
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,944
We're done.

616
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:23,610
AUDIENCE: Is it?

617
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,220
PROFESSOR: Almost work.

618
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,860
Yeah, this is--

619
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,630
AUDIENCE: Over [INAUDIBLE]--

620
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,826
AUDIENCE: I thought this
was just programming.

621
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,310
AUDIENCE: --it's a
dictionary, though.

622
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:27,910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

623
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,400
It's programming.

624
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,280
So this is the DP
solution to the program

625
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,400
because, instead of
building the graph,

626
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,410
you're writing the recursion.

627
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,060
And you're writing using
this implicit representation

628
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,284
of the graph.

629
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,844
AUDIENCE: Oh.

630
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:42,760
PROFESSOR: This is it.

631
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,440
This is DP.

632
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,940
Most people are
really afraid of it.

633
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,360
This is the hardest
thing in the course.

634
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,443
If you get the connection
between graphs and this,

635
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:51,318
and if you know how to
model graphs, that it.

636
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:52,818
You're one month
in the term, you're

637
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:53,960
done with six double six.

638
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,130
You already know
everything to ace the exam.

639
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,630
OK.

640
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,713
AUDIENCE: Aren't graphs
just programming, as well?

641
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:02,050
PROFESSOR: Ah.

642
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,925
But there, you're building
a graph structure.

643
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:05,830
Here, we don't need to
build that structure.

644
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,454
Because we see the
connection directly.

645
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:09,740
Like, this code is
much smaller, right?

646
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,057
It's much easier to look at.

647
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:12,640
I mean, sorry.

648
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,851
It's faster to read.

649
00:28:13,851 --> 00:28:15,350
But it looks like
black magic if you

650
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,841
don't see the underlying graph.

651
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,340
Yes?

652
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,110
Did you have a question?

653
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,901
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so.

654
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,120
What exactly is
dynamic programming?

655
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,811
Unless they give at least
one or two examples of,

656
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:31,789
like, using something that you
had calculated already, or--

657
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:32,455
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

658
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:33,371
AUDIENCE: --Fibinocci.

659
00:28:33,371 --> 00:28:33,871
So.

660
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:34,537
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

661
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:35,040
So--

662
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,820
AUDIENCE: Ah, so
now you just have

663
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,017
to have a dictionary to
store the minimum cost.

664
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,475
AUDIENCE: That's
what d is, though.

665
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:40,305
The d of ij.

666
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:40,930
AUDIENCE: Wait.

667
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,100
PROFESSOR: So.

668
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,340
So I like your question.

669
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,614
And I'm going to address
all the other ones first.

670
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,530
And then I'm going to
spend about five minutes

671
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,600
addressing your question.

672
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,460
What is dynamic
programming, right?

673
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,670
What is the point of this?

674
00:28:52,670 --> 00:29:00,770
Like, what is
dynamic programming?

675
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,760
We're going to
come back to this.

676
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,686
So any questions about this?

677
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:06,310
AUDIENCE: Wait.

678
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,351
As you're going through--

679
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,000
AUDIENCE: Is there a dictionary?

680
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,320
PROFESSOR: Sure.

681
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,040
This is an array.

682
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,580
Or dictionary.

683
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,628
So, say this is ij.

684
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:18,430
If it's an array, or
if it's a dictionary,

685
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,210
it would be d of the tuple ij.

686
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,160
So, I can write this
in Python, right?

687
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,140
This is almost Python.

688
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,084
What am I missing?

689
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,995
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],
or it fits inside.

690
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:35,620
PROFESSOR: Yes.

691
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,411
So, I have some boundary
conditions, right?

692
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:40,755
Because this guy would depend
on this guy, which is inside.

693
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,910
And left to depend on this guy.

694
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,329
Which doesn't exist.

695
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:45,870
AUDIENCE: Oh.

696
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,766
I wasn't-- OK.

697
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:47,589
Sure.

698
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,380
PROFESSOR: So, we need
a few more ifs here,

699
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,379
for boundary conditions.

700
00:29:58,594 --> 00:30:02,340
AUDIENCE: I mean, in theory,
though, you could just

701
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,342
run through the
new dfs and create

702
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,120
a topological of the source.

703
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,620
Right?

704
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,870
And just run through that.

705
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

706
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,390
But that's so much
code to write.

707
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,090
Look at this.

708
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,040
This is five lines.

709
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,660
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

710
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,520
For this particular
problem, it's five lines.

711
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,228
PROFESSOR: Well, for
dynamic programming,

712
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:17,850
the solutions are 5 to
10 lines in general.

713
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,750
And the only hard thing
in dynamic programming

714
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,276
is figuring out what is
the state going to be.

715
00:30:24,276 --> 00:30:26,650
So, after you get used to
them, after you solve 10 or 20,

716
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,660
when people come out of
programming contests,

717
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,240
and someone says, my
solution's dynamic programming.

718
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,740
Really?

719
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,073
Wait, you can solve it that way.

720
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:33,830
And he says, yeah.

721
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,580
This is the state.

722
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,082
And then everything
else is obvious.

723
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:38,290
Like, it's pretty easy to
figure out everything else.

724
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,429
The hard part is the state.

725
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:40,970
So, it's enough to
say my solution is

726
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,803
dynamic programming.

727
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:42,742
This is my state.

728
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,200
You guys are probably
going to have

729
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,142
to say a bit more
than that on the exam.

730
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:47,630
But this is the hard part.

731
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,199
AUDIENCE: DP.

732
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,740
PROFESSOR: No, you
can't just say DP.

733
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,406
You'll definitely
need at least a state.

734
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,580
OK.

735
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,080
So.

736
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,621
AUDIENCE: You're
also missing a state

737
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:02,302
for deciding stuff in the
dictionary, though, right?

738
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:04,260
PROFESSOR: Before deciding
if my key is already

739
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,880
in the dictionary?

740
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,370
Well, so, aside from the
boundary conditions here,

741
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,810
if I compute this here, it
depends on theses two, right?

742
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,074
Are they going to be
in the dictionary?

743
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,050
AUDIENCE: Not yet.

744
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,920
PROFESSOR: Why?

745
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,560
If I'm running
this way, so if I'm

746
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,210
computing all my
values in this order.

747
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,283
So the first line one.

748
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:24,866
Then line two.

749
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,714
Then line three.

750
00:31:26,714 --> 00:31:28,630
They're already going
to be in the dictionary.

751
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,440
So this is because I'm
doing topological sort.

752
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,170
You don't need
memoization if you're not

753
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,010
using the topological
sort of the graph.

754
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,550
You only need
memoization if you don't.

755
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,877
AUDIENCE: So, why are we doing
boundaries commissions if--

756
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:43,710
PROFESSOR: Because--

757
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

758
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,810
PROFESSOR: So, I'm doing
a boundary condition

759
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:53,500
because if I paste this in if I
paste this thing in, then when

760
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,380
I am here, this is going
to refer to this guy.

761
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,420
Which is fine.

762
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,490
But it's also going
to refer to 2,0.

763
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,700
Which doesn't exist.

764
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,200
So the code might be a bit
obfuscated by the boundary

765
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,699
conditions.

766
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:11,140
But it's 10 lines of code.

767
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,940
It's pretty nice
and straightforward.

768
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,650
OK, now what is
dynamic programming?

769
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,300
I like that question.

770
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,060
PROFESSOR: So, a key
property, I don't

771
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,280
think it was
mentioned in lecture.

772
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,530
Guys, correct me if I'm wrong.

773
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,570
It's called optimal
substructure.

774
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,249
Does that ring a bell?

775
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,165
Probably going to hear
about it next time, so.

776
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,435
Optimal substructure.

777
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,400
So, the point of
optimal substructure

778
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,800
is, suppose I have a
shortest path from s to g.

779
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,300
Right?

780
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:11,580
so, suppose I have
shortest path from s to g.

781
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,130
And that path is called p.

782
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,660
Now, suppose this
path goes through d.

783
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:28,320
So, path from s to g is actually
s making a path through d.

784
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,470
And then there's another
path going from d to g.

785
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,430
This path over here, p1.

786
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:48,660
p1 is guaranteed to be the
shortest path, or a shortest

787
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,580
path, from s to d.

788
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,800
So this is the big solution.

789
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,200
It's optimal because we say it's
the solution to the problem.

790
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,910
This is a part of the solution.

791
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,660
This part of the solution
is optimal for this part

792
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,300
of the problem.

793
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,282
So the part of the problem
is getting from s to d.

794
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,760
The part of the big
optimal solution

795
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,090
is optimal-- so the small
part of the big solution

796
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,900
is optimal with respect
to the small problem.

797
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,270
So p1 has to be a
shortest path from s to d.

798
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,560
Do you guys want to see
a proof by contradiction?

799
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,834
Or do take my word for it?

800
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,339
Does anyone want to?

801
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,630
So, intuitively, the idea is
that if you had the better

802
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,360
path here, say that
path would be s3,

803
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,050
then I could replace
this, sorry. p3.

804
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,130
I could replace this with p3.

805
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,594
And I would have a
better path overall.

806
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:48,010
And that would
contradict the fact

807
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,340
that this is the best path.

808
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,600
So this part of the path
has to be a shortest path

809
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,310
to get from s to d.

810
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,250
So I've broken up my
problem to get from s to g,

811
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,320
into saying, I want to get
from s to d, from s to e.

812
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,570
Or, from s to f and
then cross one edge.

813
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,730
And then the ways I get from
s to d from s to e, or from s

814
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,150
to f, have to be optimal.

815
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,830
I've already encoded that here.

816
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,430
And nobody asked me,
yo, is this true?

817
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,330
Can I take a longer path here?

818
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,240
And have a better solution?

819
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
The answer is no.

820
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,007
In some problems,
the answer is yes.

821
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:27,465
Those are not
problems that you can

822
00:35:27,465 --> 00:35:29,790
solve with dynamic programming.

823
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,450
if, in your problems,
that's the case,

824
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,522
you probably forgot to account
for some part of the state.

825
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:38,494
AUDIENCE: What kind
of problems would it

826
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,470
be where that wouldn't be true?

827
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,620
PROFESSOR: Well,
remember the quiz problem

828
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,220
with the gas stations?

829
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,280
If you don't account for the
gas, if you do Dijkstra, then,

830
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,780
well.

831
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,850
Guess what?

832
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,700
Shortest path in
the graph, if that

833
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,070
doesn't account for gas
stops, if you start accounting

834
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,410
for the cost of
refilling, this path

835
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,840
might be longer than a
path that goes like this.

836
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,970
So, it's longer in
terms of road stalls.

837
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,170
But has fewer, or has cheaper,
gas stations on the way.

838
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,840
So then, there's no
optimal substructure.

839
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,850
And that's because you didn't
account for the fuel states.

840
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,350
OK.

841
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,640
Probably not the best example.

842
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,380
Sorry for bringing
up painful memories.

843
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,900
But the point is,
usually when you

844
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,483
have this with our problems, you
didn't account for the state.

845
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:31,540
All the problems that are
solved with dynamic programming

846
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,520
have this thing called
optimal substructure.

847
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,341
And this is sort
of how it works.

848
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:37,840
OK.

849
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,381
I have no idea how much time I
have because my phone crashed.

850
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,770
So can anyone help me?

851
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,610
Five minutes.

852
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,980
10 minutes.

853
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,480
Sorry.

854
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,420
AUDIENCE: Seven minutes.

855
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,003
PROFESSOR: OK.

856
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,730
What else do you
guys want to see?

857
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,730
AUDIENCE: Cycles.

858
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,017
[INAUDIBLE]

859
00:36:58,017 --> 00:36:58,600
PROFESSOR: OK.

860
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,800
Is everyone happy with cycles?

861
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,390
OK.

862
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,200
Almost everyone, so
that's good enough.

863
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,050
OK.

864
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,680
Let's do cycles.

865
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,596
We have seven minutes.

866
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,410
So, suppose I have this graph.

867
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:35,440
Source going a going
to be going to c.

868
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,050
And then the costs
are 1 minus 1.

869
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,940
1.

870
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,440
1.

871
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,180
Can I solve it
using that method?

872
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:54,050
Probably not.

873
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,690
Let's try to write
the recursions

874
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,460
to see what we get
for the formulas.

875
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,800
So, dsa is--

876
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,160
AUDIENCE: 1.

877
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,140
PROFESSOR: --minimum.

878
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,700
Yeah, it's 1.

879
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:14,450
But it's the minimum
of dss plus weight sa.

880
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,720
ds-- well, almost.

881
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,240
Actually, it's not 1.

882
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,640
Likely.

883
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,922
You're confusing me again.

884
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:31,130
There's one more edges that
they have to account for.

885
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,480
AUDIENCE: Oh.

886
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,400
PROFESSOR: dsc plus weight.

887
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm going to fail today.

888
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,220
I'm tired.

889
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,300
AUDIENCE: ca.

890
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,910
PROFESSOR: OK.

891
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,100
So we accounted for both
edges coming in now.

892
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:51,300
dsb is minimum of
dsa plus weight ab.

893
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,710
dsc is minimum of
dsb plus weight bc.

894
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,330
Right?

895
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,742
And dss is 0 because we
promised that's how we start.

896
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,820
OK.

897
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,900
Now what if I try
evaluate these?

898
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,600
Is there a sane order in
which I can evaluate them?

899
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,170
Nope.

900
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,110
Let's see why.

901
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:26,214
If I try to evaluate
sa, this depends on sc.

902
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:27,630
AUDIENCE: Which
we don't have yet.

903
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,810
PROFESSOR: sc is here.
sc depends on sb.

904
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,080
sb is here.

905
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,090
And it depends on sa.

906
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,790
Which was.

907
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,701
So we have this infinite
recursion, right?

908
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:43,950
They all depend on each other.

909
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,100
There's a loop here.

910
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,720
There's a negative cycle.

911
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,450
Can't use this algorithm.

912
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,570
That's a shame.

913
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,802
What can we do instead?

914
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:56,135
PROFESSOR: Show a negative node.

915
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:57,602
A negative weight.

916
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:58,312
half.

917
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,020
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

918
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,940
AUDIENCE: Can we just get rid
of the negative weight half?

919
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,090
PROFESSOR: No.

920
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,020
That's the best edge.

921
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,353
That's probably going to be
part of the solution, right?

922
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:09,184
AUDIENCE: Can we add
1 to all the edges?

923
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,100
PROFESSOR: That's still
going to have a cycle.

924
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,570
I still won't be
able to run this.

925
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,452
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

926
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,410
AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford.

927
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
PROFESSOR: Bellman-ford.

928
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,110
AUDIENCE: That's not dynamic.

929
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,910
PROFESSOR: OK.

930
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,136
Well, one way to do it
is Bellman-Ford, right?

931
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:25,010
Another way, which we
went through last time,

932
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,110
is to break the cycle.

933
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,380
And the way we break
the cycle is we

934
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,440
add the path length
into the equation.

935
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:40,920
So, I'm going to
look at the distance

936
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,730
from a source to some
node, so the distance

937
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,310
from a source to some node, as
the distance from the source

938
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,280
to some other node
plus the edge weight.

939
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,660
This is what I
had before, right?

940
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,270
Nothing new here.

941
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:05,910
So dsv is the minimum
over all the edges of dsu

942
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,710
plus weight uv, Right?

943
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,880
Minimum over all uv.

944
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,490
That's our edges.

945
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:14,990
Right?

946
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,906
This is the old stuff.

947
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,970
Now, we're going to
say this instead.

948
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:24,150
The distance from s to v,
using a path of length k,

949
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:31,280
is the minimum over all the
edges of the distance from s

950
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,930
to u, using a path
of what length?

951
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,200
If this path is length k.

952
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,140
So k edges.

953
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,001
How many edges do I have here?

954
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:43,876
AUDIENCE: k equals 1.

955
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,310
PROFESSOR: So this is
distance su using k minus 1

956
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,090
plus the weight of uv.

957
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,060
AUDIENCE: So what's the
difference between the two?

958
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,240
PROFESSOR: So, this
will always decrease.

959
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,770
So I guarantee that they will
not have an infinite recursion.

960
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,740
This is the magic
that makes it work.

961
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,870
Now, an equivalent way
of looking at this,

962
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,780
is building a graph.

963
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,280
That's what we've
been doing so far.

964
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,167
So let's build an
equivalent graph to this.

965
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,042
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

966
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,350
PROFESSOR: It's going to
get to 0 eventually, right?

967
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:36,220
So when k is 0, the distance
from the source to itself is 0.

968
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,875
But the distance from the source
to any other nodes is infinity.

969
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,250
Because from the
source, we can't

970
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,921
get to anywhere else in 0 edges.

971
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:46,670
We can't teleport.

972
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:52,435
So let's build a graph to
get the intuition for this.

973
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:54,220
This looks mathy.

974
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,770
This looks too mathy.

975
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,391
So, at the first layer,
you only have the source.

976
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:01,140
You can only get from
the source to itself

977
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,850
by not crossing any edges.

978
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,170
At level one, you potentially
have all the nodes.

979
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,070
If the source is
connected to everything,

980
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,278
you might have all the nodes.

981
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:15,770
So, s1, a1, b1, c1.

982
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,656
Where can you get
from the source?

983
00:43:18,656 --> 00:43:19,600
AUDIENCE: To a.

984
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,320
PROFESSOR: To a.

985
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,940
What's the cost of the edge?

986
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,720
AUDIENCE: 1.

987
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,910
PROFESSOR: OK.

988
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,770
Now, let's build a second layer.

989
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:35,940
s2, a2, b2, c2.

990
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,090
So someone tell me the edges.

991
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,130
So, assuming I can get
to this node using one

992
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,110
edge, how can I get to this
other node using two edges?

993
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:47,810
AUDIENCE: A to b.

994
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,980
PROFESSOR: OK. a to b.

995
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,090
a1 to b2.

996
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,550
AUDIENCE: 2.

997
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,390
PROFESSOR: OK.

998
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,890
Cost?

999
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,030
AUDIENCE: 1 [INAUDIBLE].

1000
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,440
A1 to c--

1001
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,320
AUDIENCE: That's negative 1.

1002
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,410
PROFESSOR: a1 to b2.

1003
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:00,910
Thank you.

1004
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:04,850
OK.

1005
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1006
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:06,650
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

1007
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,890
AUDIENCE: Are we
doing anything else?

1008
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,940
PROFESSOR: I think so.

1009
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,730
So, if I'm at b using one edge,
I can get to c using two edges.

1010
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,495
Cost?

1011
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:16,830
AUDIENCE: 1.

1012
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,510
PROFESSOR: OK.

1013
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,320
If I'm at c using one edge--

1014
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,632
AUDIENCE: a.

1015
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:22,840
PROFESSOR: --using two edges.

1016
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,803
Cost?

1017
00:44:23,803 --> 00:44:25,487
AUDIENCE: 1.

1018
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:26,070
PROFESSOR: OK.

1019
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,220
And if I'm at s using one edge?

1020
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,150
AUDIENCE: a.

1021
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1022
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,830
PROFESSOR: Can you?

1023
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,122
AUDIENCE: There's now edge.

1024
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:37,246
PROFESSOR: There's no edge.

1025
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:38,892
AUDIENCE: I thought it was
just like an assumed edge.

1026
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:39,558
PROFESSOR: Nope.

1027
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:40,600
Nope.

1028
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,000
Not an edge.

1029
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,870
As to a, cost?

1030
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,370
AUDIENCE: 1.

1031
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,041
PROFESSOR: 1.

1032
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:46,540
OK.

1033
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,380
Let's build a third level.

1034
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:53,885
s3, a3, b3, c3.

1035
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,896
Someone dictate
the edges please.

1036
00:44:59,896 --> 00:45:03,137
AUDIENCE: S2 to a3.

1037
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:04,063
With 1.

1038
00:45:04,063 --> 00:45:06,810
I mean, it's going
to be the exact same.

1039
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,740
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1040
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,440
a2 to b3 minus 1.

1041
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,560
b2 to c3 1.

1042
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,580
And c2 to a3 1.

1043
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,420
So these are exactly
the same edges, right?

1044
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,420
Because they're the
original edges in the graph.

1045
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,520
Every edge in the graph
can connect to levels here.

1046
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,585
So, all edges.

1047
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,830
All edges.

1048
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,790
All edges from s.

1049
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,960
How many layers do I need?

1050
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:52,367
AUDIENCE: e.

1051
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:52,950
PROFESSOR: OK.

1052
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,730
Pretty close.

1053
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,752
Let's try something smaller.

1054
00:45:56,752 --> 00:45:57,688
AUDIENCE: a.

1055
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,624
AUDIENCE: Oh.

1056
00:45:58,624 --> 00:46:00,030
That makes no sense.

1057
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:04,120
PROFESSOR: So, what's the
longest path in a graph?

1058
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,210
Graph of v vertices.

1059
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,340
What is the longest path?

1060
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,000
AUDIENCE: The
number [INAUDIBLE].

1061
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,620
PROFESSOR: The
longest shortest path.

1062
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,940
AUDIENCE: v minus 1.

1063
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,330
PROFESSOR: v minus 1.

1064
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,800
That's how Bellman-Ford
has v minus 1 runs, right?

1065
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,540
AUDIENCE: Oh.

1066
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,780
PROFESSOR: So, a shortest
path can't have a cycle.

1067
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,500
If it has a cycle, then it
means it's an infinite cycle.

1068
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,150
So there's no solution.

1069
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,942
Shortest paths have
no cycles therefore,

1070
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:26,650
even if they go through
the entire graph,

1071
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,300
they're going to
have v minus 1 edges.

1072
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,890
So I'm going to have
v minus 1 layers.

1073
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:38,060
Here, I drew three
layers, so I'm done.

1074
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,414
That's why I stopped at three.

1075
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:42,580
So let's see how many nodes
and how many edges we're

1076
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,371
going to have if we do
this transformation.

1077
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:57,892
v prime is-- so, how many times
am I going to copy the graph?

1078
00:46:57,892 --> 00:46:59,058
AUDIENCE: Two or thee times.

1079
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:00,020
AUDIENCE: Three times.

1080
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,603
PROFESSOR: OK.

1081
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:02,082
And in general terms?

1082
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:03,230
AUDIENCE: v minus 1.

1083
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,367
AUDIENCE: v minus 1 times.

1084
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:04,950
PROFESSOR: OK.

1085
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,920
So I'm going to copy the
graph v minus 1 times.

1086
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,320
And then I'm going to add
that one source, right?

1087
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,820
Doesn't really matter because
it's order of b squared.

1088
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,267
How many edges?

1089
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:22,676
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1090
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,732
PROFESSOR: Order of v times e.

1091
00:47:28,732 --> 00:47:30,190
We can do the math
that's whatever.

1092
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,060
Let's say it's
something like this.

1093
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,060
So the running time-- this
graph is acyclic, right?

1094
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,830
All the nodes are going forward.

1095
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,940
The new graph that I have here.

1096
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,904
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1097
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:43,695
PROFESSOR: So, I can
use the DAG algorithm.

1098
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,540
So the running time, if
I use the DAG algorithm,

1099
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,220
is v prime plus e prime.

1100
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,140
Which is?

1101
00:47:57,426 --> 00:47:58,905
AUDIENCE: v.

1102
00:47:58,905 --> 00:47:59,780
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

1103
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,580
AUDIENCE: Or is it ve?

1104
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,020
PROFESSOR: So, it's v
squared plus ve, which is ve,

1105
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,370
for most purposes.

1106
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:07,904
And this is?

1107
00:48:07,904 --> 00:48:08,862
AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford.

1108
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:10,450
PROFESSOR: Bellman-Ford.

1109
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,700
So this is Bellman-Ford.

1110
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,060
This is what Bellman-Ford does.

1111
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,530
Except when you're
coding it up, it

1112
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,500
relaxes the edges
in a different way.

1113
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,700
But this is the intuition
behind Bellman-Ford.

1114
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,390
And this is an easy way to
see why Bellman-Ford works.

1115
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:32,269
AUDIENCE: So,
practically, we really

1116
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:34,265
wouldn't want to do
dynamic programming.

1117
00:48:34,265 --> 00:48:37,164
We just want to run
Bellman-Ford because that's

1118
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,040
less code, right?

1119
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,450
PROFESSOR: So, this is
the dynamic programming

1120
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,370
view of Bellman-Ford.

1121
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,427
Write Bellman-Ford.

1122
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:48,760
There's a reason why we taught
you to write it that way.

1123
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,247
It's going to be shorter.

1124
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:52,705
This just gives
you more intuition.

1125
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:54,750
And it shows you how
the DAG algorithm

1126
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,740
relates to Bellman-Ford.

1127
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,380
And this is how we handle
cycles, which are removed.

1128
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,870
So, that means I have fulfilled
my promise of covering

1129
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,260
two of the issues that
I had on the board.

1130
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:06,800
Yes.

1131
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,325
So any questions about this?

1132
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,640
So, we didn't do the
pseudocode for the shortest

1133
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,190
path using DAGs.

1134
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,420
The code that we gave
you in the code handout

1135
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,440
matches the pseudocode
that you'd write.

1136
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,750
Yes?

1137
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,960
AUDIENCE: So, if all edges
were negative 1 here,

1138
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,760
except for the top edge,
looking at this graph over here,

1139
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,151
how would the search go through,
such that it would find,

1140
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:39,400
lik,e negative two weight half?

1141
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,220
PROFESSOR: So these
edges are minus 1?

1142
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1143
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,408
PROFESSOR: Well, do you have
a solution in this case?

1144
00:49:50,164 --> 00:49:51,160
AUDIENCE: It's no.

1145
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:51,743
PROFESSOR: No.

1146
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,490
But you could have this, right?

1147
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,728
And expect the
whole thing to work.

1148
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:03,912
AUDIENCE: No, that's still
not, that's not making sense.

1149
00:50:03,912 --> 00:50:04,620
PROFESSOR: Is it?

1150
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,950
AUDIENCE: It's negative 1 cycle.

1151
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:06,210
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

1152
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,001
That's unfortunate.

1153
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:07,920
OK.

1154
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,780
Never mind.

1155
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,690
Do like this?

1156
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,500
OK.

1157
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,349
AUDIENCE: So, also,
looking at the graph,

1158
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,375
there's only one natural
path that you can take.

1159
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:22,000
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1160
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,590
So, if I go from s to
c, like this, sabc,

1161
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:34,850
this is going to
be s0, a1, b2, c3.

1162
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,247
So, all the paths go ahead.

1163
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:39,371
AUDIENCE: So, what if I
wanted to find the shortest

1164
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:41,281
path to s to b?

1165
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:43,280
Like, in terms of actually
writing an algorithm,

1166
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,450
would it be s0, a1, b2, or s1?

1167
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:46,967
a2, b3.

1168
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:47,550
PROFESSOR: OK.

1169
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,675
So, if you actually want
to read the shortest path,

1170
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:53,910
then the shortest path could
have length 1, length 2,

1171
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,000
or length 3, right?

1172
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,820
I don't know.

1173
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,567
So I would have to
look at all these.

1174
00:50:58,567 --> 00:50:59,108
AUDIENCE: Oh.

1175
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:01,568
OK.

1176
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:04,790
So you just run it from
s0 to any b, basically.

1177
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,030
PROFESSOR: So, the algorithm
that we have there computes

1178
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,970
the path from one source
to everything else.

1179
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,790
So I run it.

1180
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:12,730
It runs.

1181
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,432
Computes all the shortest paths.

1182
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:15,890
And then I have to
read these ones.

1183
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,280
And get the smallest one.

1184
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,030
That's a question.

1185
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,020
Thank you.

1186
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,840
Yeah, that is a detail
that I left out.

1187
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,339
Thank you.

1188
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,770
So, no more cycles.

1189
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:35,510
OK.

1190
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,343
Any other questions?

1191
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:39,200
Yes?

1192
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,699
AUDIENCE: I'm still, like, on
the initial problem and stuff.

1193
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,550
A bit of a disconnect.

1194
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,810
When you were underlining
stuff, like the sa,

1195
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,890
it seemed to me that,
like, in that case,

1196
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,290
when you're going
forward, you're never

1197
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:57,430
going to stop because
you're doing recursion.

1198
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,330
So you never have a
beginning point, almost.

1199
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,152
Effectively, if you, like--

1200
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:04,490
PROFESSOR: So, do you mean here?

1201
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,364
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

1202
00:52:05,364 --> 00:52:08,614
PROFESSOR: So, in that case,
this is the beginning point.

1203
00:52:08,614 --> 00:52:09,280
AUDIENCE: Right.

1204
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,780
PROFESSOR: If I go through the
nodes in the topological sort

1205
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,070
order, then all I need
is one beginning point.

1206
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,345
Because everything else
will refer back to that.

1207
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:19,570
There has to be a
topological sort order.

1208
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,660
And the first node in
that order is my source.

1209
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:32,270
And, if we have cycles, then the
beginning conditions are here.

1210
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,191
So that's why I'm only
drawing this vertex.

1211
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:36,190
Because these other
vertices wouldn't be useful.

1212
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:42,810
OK.

1213
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,850
So then, that being said, don't
forget your quizzes and happy

1214
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,400
Thanksgiving.
