8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,980
PROFESSOR: So we're going
to do a problem that

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,330
looks like the guitar problem.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,912
But it's a bit cooler.

11
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,620
At the same time,
there are fewer states,

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,370
so I think it's
easier to manage.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,286
How many people know
how to play DDR?

14
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:39,190
AUDIENCE: Well.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:40,980
OK.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,832
How many people know the
rules of playing DDR?

18
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:46,040
Because otherwise I won't
be able to lift my hand up.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,970
OK.

20
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,640
OK, so let's go through
an algorithmic model.

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,510
So, you have a board that
basically looks like this.

22
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,090
And you have four
touch sensitive pads.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,140
Up, down, left, right.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,230
And then you have
a center position.

25
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,340
You also have a sheet of notes
that looks something like this.

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:23,700
Say, up, up down, down, up
down, up, up down, left right,

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,039
left, left right, right.

28
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,830
So on and so forth.

29
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,760
So when you see an
arrow of up, that's

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,130
a constraint that
says one of your feet

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,310
has to be on the up arrow.

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,410
Has to tap the up
arrow, actually.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,470
There's no constraint
for the other foot.

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,770
So your other foot can be
anywhere else on the board.

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,340
It doesn't matter.

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,980
You are also allowed to tap
the board some extra times.

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,130
So if you don't have
a note showing up,

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,780
you can still hit the board.

39
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,340
And there's no penalty.

40
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,340
So you can hop around as
many times as you want,

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,260
or as many times as you can,
until you run out of breath.

42
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,550
So up basically means, it's
actually one foot has to be up.

43
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,100
The other one center.

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,589
Also, of course, because
of the design of the board,

45
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,130
it doesn't matter
what foot is where.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,251
So what are possible
goals for this game?

47
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,000
AUDIENCE: Not to get an F.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,240
PROFESSOR: OK.

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,711
AUDIENCE: Hit all
the arrows when

50
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,637
they line up with the top row.

51
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:33,220
PROFESSOR: OK.

52
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,680
So there are two different
ways of doing it.

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,660
One, you said,
"not to get an F."

54
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,020
So I would say, given some
limited set of skills.

55
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,220
So given a set of skills,
or your skill level

56
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,980
maximizes your score. right?

57
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,606
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

58
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,230
PROFESSOR: This is
dynamic programming,

59
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,115
so we always want to
maximize something.

60
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,160
Now, if you're really good,
then another possible goal

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:10,740
is hit all the notes with
a minimum amount of effort.

62
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,120
If you're going to
be in a competition,

63
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,703
and you're going to
be doing 10 songs,

64
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:19,890
you don't want to die after
the first song, right?

65
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,370
So, assuming you can do
everything reasonably well,

66
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,830
this is another possible goal.

67
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,804
Any other goals?

68
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:29,970
So we're brainstorming here.

69
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,210
This isn't set in stone.

70
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,150
We've already seen the formal
solution for this problem.

71
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,430
So I want to play with it
for a little bit, right?

72
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,910
We brought a DDR pad, so
I want to play with it.

73
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,990
What else could you hope
to maximize or minimize

74
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,205
for with dynamic programming?

75
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,590
AUDIENCE: Not look ridiculous.

76
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,470
PROFESSOR: OK.

77
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,961
AUDIENCE: I guess we're looking
at the cost of each move,

78
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:00,460
right?

79
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,180
PROFESSOR: So,
hit all the notes.

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,685
Minimum effort, or otherwise
say best appearance.

81
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,230
So every move looks somewhat
good or somewhat bad.

82
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,269
And you want to do the moves
that look as good as possible.

83
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,410
So this maximizes
entertainment, right?

84
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,830
if you're on TV, you
probably want this.

85
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,590
Now suppose you are
in a competition

86
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,640
and you only have
one track to play.

87
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,254
AUDIENCE: Well, you know
where all the notes are.

88
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:45,920
PROFESSOR: Sure.

89
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,919
Like, we assume that we
know this ahead of time.

90
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,032
So you've memorized this.

91
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,990
And you're trying to
compute the best strategy,

92
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,031
so you can memorize that.

93
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,980
Then when you go and
play, you dominate.

94
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

95
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,769
PROFESSOR: So, if
you have one track,

96
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,560
then I would say that
what you'd want to do

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,950
is minimize your
probability of failure.

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,450
Right?

99
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,459
So given the probability of
failure for each possible move.

100
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,750
You want to minimize the
overall probability of failure

101
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,170
so your teammates
won't hate you.

102
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,386
So, hit all the
notes and minimize.

103
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:26,370
So this one's a little bit
different from the other ones

104
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,953
because all the other
ones are already

105
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,390
set up as a nice problem
where you add up things.

106
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,880
So you can solve
them with graphs

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,770
or with dynamic programming.

108
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,580
If you want to minimize
the probability of failure,

109
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,320
then you want to maximize
the probability of success.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,840
The probability of
succeeding on all your moves

111
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,550
is the product of
the probability

112
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,321
of succeeding on each move.

113
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:46,820
All right?

114
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,110
So if you have five
moves, then you

115
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,590
have five individual
probabilities.

116
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,540
You multiply them up.

117
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,820
And that's the probability that
you execute the whole sequence

118
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,930
correctly, and not stumble.

119
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,430
So we have products
instead of sums.

120
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,760
Yes?

121
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,093
AUDIENCE: Isn't it related
to the maximizing score goal?

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,240
PROFESSOR: You can.

123
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,210
Well, not necessarily
because this one

124
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,520
says that you only have
some possible moves.

125
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,450
I think in the end, all of
them, except for this last one,

126
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,840
can be solved using the
recursion depth we have for it.

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
The last one, you have
to do a bit of massaging.

128
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,339
And we're going
over that right now.

129
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,610
So, you have products
instead of sums.

130
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,695
How do you turn
products into sums?

131
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:32,910
AUDIENCE: Logs?

132
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,850
PROFESSOR: Yep.

133
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,220
So, for this one, I
would want to use logs,

134
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,450
so that I can say that
I want to maximize

135
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,200
the log probability of success.

136
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,660
Which is just the sum of the
log probabilities for each move.

137
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,580
And then it looks like
dynamic programming, as usual.

138
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,550
Now, if I wouldn't
want to use logs,

139
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,920
if I'm using the DP formulation,
where I'm doing recursion,

140
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,790
I can incorporate
products there.

141
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,290
But it turns out,
I didn't practice.

142
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,331
If you have a lot of
numbers that are close to 1,

143
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,070
or that are close to 0,
so all the easy moves

144
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,920
are going to be really
close to 1, for example.

145
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,310
If you have a lot of numbers
that are close to 1 or close

146
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,460
to 0, if you
multiply them up, you

147
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,830
get numerical instabilities.

148
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,000
So we get the number
that's really close to 1.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,100
So for example, if I'm choosing
whether to do, say I'm here,

150
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,230
and I'm thinking, do I
want to move like this?

151
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,260
Or do I want to move like
this, and then like this?

152
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,970
These are both
pretty easy moves.

153
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,785
So, in both cases, we're
looking at probabilities

154
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:38,560
of success of 99.991%.

155
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,010
And maybe 99.992%.

156
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,445
So if you have numbers
with probabilities

157
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,820
that are really close to 1,
and if you have a lot of them

158
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,960
and you try to
multiply them, you're

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,990
going to get a bad result.

160
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,440
So all the products are going
to start looking the same.

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,140
So we're going to get
a random solution,

162
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,530
instead of what you want.

163
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,640
This is a practical thing.

164
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,100
It's called numerical
instability.

165
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,310
And it's a practical
reason why you'd

166
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,789
want to use logs, instead
of multiplying things up.

167
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,330
So it's not just a
theoretical thing.

168
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,200
It also makes life
nice in practice.

169
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,700
OK.

170
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,270
So we have a goal
that looks like this.

171
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,630
Say, let's go for this one.

172
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,820
Hit all the notes,
minimize the effort.

173
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,480
And all the other ones can
be reduced to this one.

174
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,490
We need to define effort, right?

175
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,300
Let's say that we have a
function called delta, that

176
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,280
takes two foot locations--
so, where both of my feet

177
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,500
are-- from and to.

178
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:48,470
And it gives me a number from
0 to 1, where 0 is really easy.

179
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,980
And 1 is really hard.

180
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,480
So from would look something
like, my left foot is up.

181
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,230
My right foot is centered.

182
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,230
To would look something like,
my left foot is centered

183
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,550
and my right foot is up.

184
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,730
So basically going
from here to here.

185
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,427
So from left foot up.

186
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,330
Right foot center.

187
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,960
To here.

188
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,140
So there is some
difficulty there, right?

189
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,830
We have to jump, so it's not 0.

190
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,230
I'm burning some calories here.

191
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,530
So any move that I make
has some difficulty.

192
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,300
And I want to solve the
game so that overall I

193
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,450
have a reasonably
small total difficulty.

194
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,130
OK, are we understanding
the problem?

195
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,610
So we have three
possible avenues here.

196
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,040
We can start solving it
using dynamic programming.

197
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,550
We can start solving
it using graphs.

198
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,670
Or we can have someone else
play the DDR again so that we

199
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,120
can get more hands
on experience,

200
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,860
and look at what a good strategy
or a bad strategy looks like.

201
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
So you guys get to vote.

202
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,790
Who wants to solve this using
the dynamic programming?

203
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,550
Who wants to solve
this using graphs?

204
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,380
Who wants to get more
hands on experience?

205
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,160
Damn.

206
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,280
I was hoping that DDR would win.

207
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,620
You guys are boring.

208
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,832
So, graphs, right?

209
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:21,915
We're going to have notes.

210
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,820
Notes represent states, right?

211
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,300
So a state is where you are
at some point in the game.

212
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,510
And we'll have to define
what where you are means.

213
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,550
And then, when you
jump, you make a move.

214
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,150
So moves go between states.

215
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,370
So in any game, you
have states and moves.

216
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,980
A state is very
hard to put in time.

217
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,021
And then you make a move.

218
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:45,620
Like in chess.

219
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,270
Your state is your
board position.

220
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,200
And whether you're
moving, or your opponent

221
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,865
is the next to move.

222
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,490
And the move is when you take a
piece and put it from one place

223
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:53,989
to another.

224
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,710
So your vertices are states.

225
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,270
And your edges are moves.

226
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,110
So what's in a state?

227
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,050
This is our problem.

228
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,740
Whether we're solving
it with graphs

229
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,140
or with dynamic
programming, this

230
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,937
is what everything
comes down to.

231
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:18,770
What's in the state?

232
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,440
AUDIENCE: So your current
state is how much difficulty

233
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
have you-- what is the problem?

234
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,672
Are those representing
the probabilities,

235
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:37,380
the difficulties?

236
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,400
Or.

237
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,460
PROFESSOR: So this is the
difficulty for one move.

238
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,000
Does it depend on
previous moves?

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,797
AUDIENCE: No, but.

240
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:45,380
PROFESSOR: No.

241
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,530
So it's a nice thing to
note that the difficulties

242
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,779
for each move are independent.

243
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:01,216
AUDIENCE: Would it be
dependent in real life?

244
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,698
You'll get tired at the end.

245
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,168
And he's able to
have less energy.

246
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:08,170
PROFESSOR: Yep.

247
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,060
So, in real life, we might
want to say that this actually

248
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,870
depends on how much energy
you've expended so far.

249
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,740
And if we have time,
let's solve that problem.

250
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,680
So the nice thing
about this problem

251
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,950
is there are many directions
in which we can take it.

252
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,920
This is one of them.

253
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm fine.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,780
And I think we'll learn
a lot by doing that.

255
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,340
So back to the original problem.

256
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,100
Suppose that it doesn't
matter how tired you are.

257
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,720
You're pretty
good, so you're not

258
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,413
going to be tired
enough to go [GASP].

259
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,020
So, mostly independent
difficulties for each move.

260
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,240
What's in a state?

261
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,417
AUDIENCE: The sum of the
difficulties up to that point.

262
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,000
PROFESSOR: OK.

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,500
So.

264
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,765
AUDIENCE: Your
appearance factor,

265
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:12,885
if we're including that.

266
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:13,610
Or are we only doing--

267
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,901
PROFESSOR: So we're doing this.

268
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,801
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was just.

269
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:18,763
Oh, effort.

270
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:19,930
OK, we're minimizing effort.

271
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,804
PROFESSOR: So the way
I like to think of this

272
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,590
is, what is does a
solution look like?

273
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,458
It's made up of
decisions, right?

274
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,416
What are the decisions?

275
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,500
AUDIENCE: To make that move
or don't make that move?

276
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,470
PROFESSOR: We'll see.

277
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,040
But once you know what
the decisions are,

278
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,456
then you have to think, what
do I need to make a decision?

279
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,650
AUDIENCE: The note.

280
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:51,840
PROFESSOR: So, a
note is one of these.

281
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,000
For some reason,
they're called notes.

282
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,300
AUDIENCE: So you
know that somehow you

283
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,950
have to hit all of them?

284
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,116
Like, you can have
steps in between.

285
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:05,740
PROFESSOR: Yep.

286
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,864
AUDIENCE: Moves in between.

287
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,480
You have to hit all of them.

288
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,420
PROFESSOR: OK, so I like this.

289
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,640
So, every one of these is going
to have to generate a move.

290
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,430
And there might be
some moves in between.

291
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,950
Well, each move is going
to map to some edge.

292
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,160
And I'm going to need vertices.

293
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,510
So, as an algorithms program
where when I hear that, oh.

294
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,040
I can have some moves in
between, I get really uneasy.

295
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,424
Like, what is this?

296
00:14:37,424 --> 00:14:38,840
How many moves am
I going to have?

297
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,340
Is this going to
become really huge?

298
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,950
And am I not going to be able
to run any algorithm on it?

299
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,200
So let's think about that.

300
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,910
How many moves would
I have in between?

301
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,409
And, what would I
achieve with them?

302
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,760
AUDIENCE: I guess you'd have
a max of, like, four, right?

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,584
I mean, you can put your
right leg someplace,

304
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,250
and you can put your
left leg someplace.

305
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,870
That's like a max of two.

306
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,370
Right?

307
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,350
Or no?

308
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,350
PROFESSOR: So, let's
think of an example.

309
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,670
You want to go, say,
I want to go, what?

310
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,930
From here to here, right?

311
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,980
AUDIENCE: Um-hmm.

312
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,110
PROFESSOR: And
you're thinking what?

313
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,750
They can do this, oh sorry.

314
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,430
So I can do this as one move.

315
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,420
And this is one move.

316
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:22,548
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

317
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,236
Or you can just do
one jump, right?

318
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:25,645
So it's-- oh, yeah.

319
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,570
I guess that's more than one.

320
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,090
PROFESSOR: OK.

321
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,660
So looking at this,
if I'm considering

322
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,240
whether to go from here to here.

323
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,387
If I want to go either this way,
or if I want to go this way.

324
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:42,970
So let's write this
down on the board.

325
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:54,050
So I'm going from up
down to left right.

326
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,120
And I'm considering, do
I want to go directly

327
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,690
or do I want to
go up right first.

328
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,980
And then left right.

329
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Let's not do these arrows
because they're confusing.

330
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,060
So, do I want to
transition like this?

331
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,990
Or do I want to
transition like this?

332
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,700
Well, I claim that, since
my moves are independent,

333
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,990
going from here to here,
if it's beneficial to go

334
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,990
this way instead of
this way, I would

335
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,070
want to go this
way all the time.

336
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,330
So I would just say that, look.

337
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,372
Inside my delta here, I
would say that, actually,

338
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,371
if you know what you're
doing, whenever you have

339
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:36,780
to go from here to here,
you're going to go like this.

340
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,650
And the delta is going to report
to the total delta for this.

341
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,150
So, if the problem is
that they have one note,

342
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,550
and then I have my next note
like this, between these two

343
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,610
notes, I can always
go in one move.

344
00:16:58,544 --> 00:16:59,960
AUDIENCE: So you're
saying 1 would

345
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,550
like, including in our
difficulty function,

346
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,150
it'll also tell
us, like, what move

347
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,900
we should make to get there?

348
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,300
PROFESSOR: How to get there.

349
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,270
The best way to get from
one state to another.

350
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,770
Well, like when
you're learning DDR,

351
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,990
these are the
basic steps, right?

352
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,680
Like, you practice until you
know how to get from one place

353
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,410
to another.

354
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,960
There is something else where
you need intermediate steps.

355
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,634
AUDIENCE: Or if
you're holding one

356
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:30,685
and then you've got
to move to another.

357
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:31,185
Right?

358
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,810
PROFESSOR: So, let's
not worry about holds.

359
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,393
Let's say that we
would just represent

360
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:43,390
holds as-- so if you have
a hold in a game, then

361
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,370
we're just going to
represent it like this.

362
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,244
We're going to cheat.

363
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,946
So we don't have
to deal with it.

364
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,820
In real life, you would
have to deal with it.

365
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,361
Like if you're actually writing
a program that trains people.

366
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:59,970
AUDIENCE: What happens if you
have, like, right, left, up

367
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,780
or something.

368
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,200
So let's say you start off
hitting your right foot

369
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,836
on the top, and then you have
to hit the right one again.

370
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:12,420
And then you have
to hit up again

371
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,670
and then you have to transfer.

372
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,700
So I guess anytime you
have to through the middle.

373
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
You have move your foot.

374
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,540
PROFESSOR: So I like the idea
of going through the middle.

375
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,954
Why or how do you, why would
you go through the middle?

376
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:32,099
AUDIENCE: To avoid crossing
your leg over or something.

377
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,265
PROFESSOR: Well, what if I
have something like this?

378
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,540
If there are DDR experts, I
know this isn't the right way

379
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,040
to do it.

380
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:49,595
But one way of doing it is
left, right, left, right, left,

381
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,640
right.

382
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,950
So then, I have some states
that account for the fact

383
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,741
that I'm centering.

384
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,080
So, some people like
to do this, right?

385
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,070
Some people like to go to the
center as much as possible,

386
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,500
if they have time
between the moves.

387
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,060
So then, I would need
at least one state

388
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,167
in between where I'm
allowed to center, right?

389
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,000
In order to represent
what I just did there,

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,570
I need one move.

391
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,610
So, one way I could meet
this is I have left center.

392
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,980
And then left right.

393
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,729
And then left right,
left right, left right.

394
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:31,520
So on and so forth.

395
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,160
But this would mean that
instead of doing this, which

396
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,091
is reasonably easy, I
would have to do this.

397
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:38,590
This.

398
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,940
And then jump, jump,
jump, jump every time.

399
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,900
Harder.

400
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,930
Not good.

401
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,870
Not good for my knees.

402
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,196
Not good for my score.

403
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:46,320
So I don't want to do this.

404
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,200
I want to have an intermediate
state so I can say,

405
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,340
I start here and
then I get back here.

406
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,540
Then I do this.

407
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,610
Then I get back here.

408
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,690
Then I go here.

409
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,630
And then I go back here.

410
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,510
And then go back.

411
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,131
Do guys see how this works?

412
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,964
AUDIENCE: You could
also rock back and forth

413
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:10,882
to because they don't require
both feet to be on the ground

414
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,269
the entire time.

415
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:13,560
PROFESSOR: Rock back and forth.

416
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,309
Hold that thought.

417
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,210
That might come in handy.

418
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,270
Assuming we have enough time.

419
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,550
So, if we only do one move
every time we see a note,

420
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,720
we're stuck with this.

421
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,180
In our to allow
re-centering, we have

422
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,550
to add states between the notes.

423
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,210
We need to add an
intermediary state.

424
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,530
And you can either think about
it, or take my word for it,

425
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,570
but if you represent the notes
using the trick that I said

426
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,460
above, and you want to represent
centering, then all you need

427
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,070
is one extra state.

428
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,960
So one extra move
between every two states.

429
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,210
Between two notes.

430
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,070
And that's enough.

431
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,270
Because that one extra
state allows you to center.

432
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,610
And it allows you to do pretty
much everything a beginner

433
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,170
like me would know how to do.

434
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,876
AUDIENCE: So you only need one
extra state between each note?

435
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:14,500
PROFESSOR: Yep.

436
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,690
That is the inside.

437
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,840
That is where I'm
thinking, right?

438
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,490
So I have to do both
this trick, to see

439
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,300
that I don't need an
infinite number of steps.

440
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,320
And come up with the
need for centering

441
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,291
to see why I need one
intermediate step.

442
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,950
By the way, does
anyone know what's

443
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,594
the right way of doing that?

444
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,260
What's the right way
of doing this move?

445
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,780
You said, rock back and forth.

446
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,860
So I wouldn't rock back and
forth in this case, right?

447
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,940
Because that
wouldn't be helpful.

448
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,648
How would I rock?

449
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:48,156
AUDIENCE: Well,
you hold down one

450
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:49,530
and then you go
to the other one.

451
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
rock left and right.

452
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,338
OK.

453
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:54,530
AUDIENCE: I said back and
forth, I meant rocking--

454
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,238
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

455
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:57,170
I thought back, forth.

456
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,090
So, the optimal
way of doing this

457
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,690
is left, right, left,
right, left, right.

458
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,497
So what am I doing?

459
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:07,830
AUDIENCE: You have another move.

460
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:15,460
You have, like, one
state for your foot where

461
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,400
it's not touching the ground.

462
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,110
PROFESSOR: OK.

463
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,160
It's an interesting, and
important, distinction.

464
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
So if I wanted to hit
both of them, if I'm here,

465
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,200
and I need to hit both of
them, I need to hit them.

466
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,770
If I only need to hit
one of them, if I'm here,

467
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,430
I can hit it like this.

468
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,180
If I'm here, though,
and I want to hit it,

469
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,659
I have to lift myself up.

470
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,450
So the difference is
whether I'm like this.

471
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,409
Or like this.

472
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:38,200
Where is my weight?

473
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,860
So if I want to allow
for these moves,

474
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,800
if I want to go past the
stage of very beginner,

475
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,190
aside from keeping track
of where my feet are,

476
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,750
I have to keep track of whether
my weight is on my left foot

477
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,920
or on my right foot.

478
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,570
So, I would actually
have l, r, and W,

479
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,210
where W is either l or r.

480
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:11,265
AUDIENCE: So your state now
has what you're currently

481
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,810
putting more weight on.

482
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,770
PROFESSOR: And where
each of the feet are.

483
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

484
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,890
Where your two feet are.

485
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,146
And then also, the
song difficulty.

486
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,070
So it's everything
in your state, right?

487
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,470
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.

488
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,470
I didn't think about it.

489
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,159
I was just talking
about foot position.

490
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,950
But we need to get back
to the state thing.

491
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,270
So that's a good point.

492
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,360
So before we get to that, how
many feet positions do we have?

493
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,610
If we don't include where
do I have my weight,

494
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,230
how many possible positions
for both of my feet do I have?

495
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,370
So I have two feet.

496
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,910
Each of them can be in any
of these five squares, right?

497
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,043
So how many total positions?

498
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:57,256
AUDIENCE: 5 choose 2.

499
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:58,620
Using 2.

500
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,358
PROFESSOR: So I can do this.

501
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:00,983
AUDIENCE: Sure.

502
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,340
Why not?

503
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,616
PROFESSOR: Well, if I have
5 choose 2, then you--

504
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:05,430
AUDIENCE: Oh, then that
doesn't quite work.

505
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,096
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

506
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

507
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,978
PROFESSOR: So flip.

508
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:13,734
AUDIENCE: Times 2.

509
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:14,400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

510
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,980
So you have two feet.

511
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,260
Each foot, five possibilities.

512
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,110
Now, what if we have weight?

513
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,670
If we are tracking on
where I keep my weight.

514
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,275
How many possible positions?

515
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:31,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

516
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh no, because there's only two.

517
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,700
PROFESSOR: So,
for each of these,

518
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,470
there's two possibilities now.

519
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,370
So 50.

520
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,170
AUDIENCE: You also have to be
so your weight is like this.

521
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:41,880
PROFESSOR: In the middle?

522
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

523
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,287
PROFESSOR: You can.

524
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,620
Based on that what I've been
reading, you never want to.

525
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,370
Because if you're
weight is in the middle,

526
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,229
then you're extending a lot
of effort to move either foot.

527
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:55,270
So you always want to have
your weight somewhere.

528
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,895
So that, at least
for one of your feet,

529
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,849
it's easy to move it.

530
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,582
AUDIENCE: Could it be the back?

531
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,290
PROFESSOR: If that's
not true, then yeah.

532
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,569
We'd need to have a center.

533
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,610
Oh, so, like, whether I'm
like this or like this?

534
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:06,852
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

535
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,554
If you were, like,
doing the same thing.

536
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:09,530
Rocking back and forth.

537
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,946
PROFESSOR: So, if
I have two feet,

538
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:13,100
then this says my weight
is on my left foot.

539
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,070
My weight is on my right foot.

540
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,070
So l and r is which foot,
not where on the board.

541
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,900
AUDIENCE: So, did you not do
center because it was optimal?

542
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,250
PROFESSOR: Because I claim
that, in an optimal strategy,

543
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,240
you wouldn't have it.

544
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,060
But you don't have to
take my word for it.

545
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
If you don't believe
me, then you add center.

546
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,110
And you just have
more possibilities.

547
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,220
And if it happens to
not be an optimal thing,

548
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,260
then the dynamic
programming will ignore it.

549
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,860
So how many positions do
I have if I add center?

550
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,099
So if I have left, center,
right for each position.

551
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:44,640
AUDIENCE: 75.

552
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,806
PROFESSOR: Cool.

553
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,395
Yes.

554
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,453
AUDIENCE: So why is it 25?

555
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:56,945
You wouldn't actually have
both of your feet on the right.

556
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:57,570
PROFESSOR: Why?

557
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,720
Maybe, well especially, for
maximizing this one actually.

558
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,800
Especially for
maximizing entertainment.

559
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,515
Then it's way cooler
to do this, right?

560
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,830
[LAUGHTER]

561
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,580
You get the point.

562
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,746
AUDIENCE: --possible weight.

563
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:16,757
Like combinations
for like, where is

564
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:18,340
you should have your
feet at one time.

565
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,764
Like, not necessarily what
the game is asking you to do.

566
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:21,430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

567
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,040
So this is where my feet are.

568
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,964
The game will always
ask something like this.

569
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:29,130
So the game won't always
care about both of my feet.

570
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,930
Sometimes it'll only
care about one foot.

571
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:33,740
So, yeah.

572
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,406
There are two different
concepts, right?

573
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,900
There's the position of my feet.

574
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,479
And then there's the
note on the screen.

575
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,520
And my feet have to match
the note on the screen.

576
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,500
And we'll have to
capture that somehow.

577
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,370
So what's in a state?

578
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,169
What are my decisions?

579
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:50,710
Come on, now.

580
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,780
We should be in a good shape
to know what my decisions are.

581
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,990
What do I decide every time?

582
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:00,034
AUDIENCE: What move to make?

583
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:00,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

584
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,950
How am I going to jump, right?

585
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,510
Where my feet are going
to be in the new position.

586
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:12,570
So every time, I'm deciding
what's the new foot position.

587
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,810
AUDIENCE: Aren't you also
deciding weight position,

588
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,157
where you're going
to hold to, right?

589
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:17,740
PROFESSOR: OK.

590
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,240
So when I say foot position,
it's a cheat for everything.

591
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,880
So yeah.

592
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,650
Good observation.

593
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,560
OK.

594
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,680
What do I need to know, in
order to make this decision?

595
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,450
OK.

596
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,450
I would need to know
where I was before

597
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,620
if I want to compute
the difficulties.

598
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,750
But aside from that-- what?

599
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,540
AUDIENCE: Sir, it came
up with this polynomial.

600
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,450
PROFESSOR: All right.

601
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,899
AUDIENCE: Is that a hint to what
the run time of this will be?

602
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,190
PROFESSOR: It's not on purpose.

603
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,600
But yes.

604
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,950
So, yeah.

605
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,730
That makes sense.

606
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,220
Probably not good.

607
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,303
I should probably not have
my screen up without me

608
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,570
looking at it.

609
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,510
OK, so.

610
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,720
Back to decisions.

611
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,530
I think I want to know what's
going to be on the screen

612
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,350
when I land, right?

613
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,120
Because if the screen says,
yo, you need to go up and down.

614
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,872
Then maybe I shouldn't
do this, right?

615
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:18,830
That would not be good.

616
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,460
So I need to know what the note
is going to be when I land.

617
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:27,630
Note.

618
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,725
AUDIENCE: Is that
the same as the next?

619
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:34,350
PROFESSOR: Yep.

620
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,360
Next note.

621
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,480
Yes.

622
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,050
So the next note
here on the screen.

623
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,880
So, my position in
this list, basically.

624
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,296
AUDIENCE: So it's kind of like
the knapsack problem, where

625
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:48,005
it's like which thing we're
considering picking up.

626
00:28:48,005 --> 00:28:51,470
But in this case, it's
coming [INAUDIBLE].

627
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,720
PROFESSOR: So it's
close to knapsack.

628
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,970
But the difference
is, in knapsack, I

629
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,680
have to decide, do I choose
this or do I ignore it.

630
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:11,779
So, if I'd be like, if I
can only do a few things

631
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,320
and I want to maximize
my score, then

632
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,870
maybe I would choose, all right.

633
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,450
This is easy.

634
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,241
I'm going to do it.

635
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:16,870
This is hard.

636
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,370
Screw it.

637
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:17,860
This is easy.

638
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,651
I'm going to do it.

639
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,780
So then my decisions are 0, 1.

640
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,610
Pick or not pick.

641
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,520
In this case, every
time my decision

642
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,870
is a new state of my feet.

643
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,046
So it's not 0, 1.

644
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:27,860
AUDIENCE: OK.

645
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,260
PROFESSOR: That's
the difference.

646
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,310
And then, because
of that, the state

647
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,570
is going to look different.

648
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,520
And the recursion's will
look a bit different.

649
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,240
OK.

650
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,710
So I want to know the
note that I'm landing at.

651
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,845
I want to know
the sum of-- well,

652
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,970
we'll see if I want to know
the sum of difficulties

653
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,230
up to this point.

654
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,730
And I want to know
one more thing, so.

655
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,310
If this is going
to be my new state,

656
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,900
and I know what note I'm landing
at, I'm making a decision.

657
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,240
The decision tells me where
my feet are going to be.

658
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,820
Right?

659
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,390
The move decides where
my feet are going to be.

660
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,640
What do I need to do?

661
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,672
What else do I need to
know for my total solution?

662
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,005
So what do I need to know to
consider between decisions?

663
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,290
So say I'm considering the
state of-- I'm at note two.

664
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,750
Note two says, left right.

665
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,790
And I'm considering
of coming here

666
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:44,700
from note one, where my
foot position was up down.

667
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,510
Or come here from
note one, where

668
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,270
my foot position was left right.

669
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,420
I need to know where
my foot position was,

670
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,650
to choose between these, right?

671
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,795
If I don't know that,
then I can't choose.

672
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,170
AUDIENCE: That's not
from your state, though?

673
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,115
PROFESSOR: Not yet.

674
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,010
It's not here, so it's
not part of my state.

675
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,570
We've been talking about it a
lot, but we didn't put it here.

676
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,070
So let's say that
the state is going

677
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,640
to have the note
that I'm landing at.

678
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,550
And my foot position
after landing.

679
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,100
So, if I know that I'm
going to land like this,

680
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,530
then I know where
I was here. l r.

681
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,920
Say, l r.

682
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,650
I can compute the
costs here, right?

683
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:47,010
This is delta of going
from this to this.

684
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:53,641
And this is the delta for
going from this to this.

685
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,540
Can you see?

686
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,290
Is that too small?

687
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,210
Delta wants to know where
my feet were before.

688
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,910
And where they're
going to be now.

689
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,290
So when I call it, I need
to know where I was before.

690
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,165
And I need to know where
I'm going to be now.

691
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:11,360
So this should be
part of my state.

692
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,140
So our decision says, what's
my new position going to be?

693
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,610
So when I make a move, I
influence my new foot position.

694
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,450
They're going to
be in someplace.

695
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,242
And independently of that,
the note-- the position here--

696
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,575
the position of the note,
increases all the time, right?

697
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:28,991
Because time can
only go forwards.

698
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,010
How are we going to account
for these extra moves?

699
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

700
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:42,990
PROFESSOR: So, we said that
between every two notes,

701
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,200
we might want to
make one extra move.

702
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,092
AUDIENCE: Like, a
potential new note

703
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:56,610
in between your
destination note?

704
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,442
PROFESSOR: Yep.

705
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,385
AUDIENCE: And then just fill
in the difficulties for that

706
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:01,350
and see which ones--

707
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,850
PROFESSOR: So, if I want to use
the algorithm that I already

708
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,090
have, that compares my
landing position to my note,

709
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,470
to see whether I can go
there or not, what note would

710
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,670
I want to put in that
intermediate note?

711
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,750
So, you're basically saying
that between every two notes,

712
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm going to have one more note.

713
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,903
And my feet can
be wherever here.

714
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:25,444
AUDIENCE: Oh.

715
00:33:25,444 --> 00:33:28,228
I mean, you'll also
have the edge originally

716
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,550
connecting them.

717
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,820
So, you'd have it going
to the intermediate note,

718
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,070
but also from the destination.

719
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,763
Yeah, like that.

720
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,070
You'd have to--

721
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:42,630
PROFESSOR: So, what
note would I have here?

722
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,556
AUDIENCE: It makes
you go to the center.

723
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,000
PROFESSOR: Do I have
to be at the center?

724
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,370
AUDIENCE: Well, you
can be anywhere.

725
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,036
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

726
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:50,900
So I'm going to
invent the blank note.

727
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,360
That's a big O. That means
you can do whatever you want.

728
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,820
There are no constraints.

729
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,800
So that is just an
intermediary state.

730
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,790
So then I'm going
to take this input,

731
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,710
and I'm going to add
these blank notes here.

732
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,690
And these map to adding
notes in the graph.

733
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:12,484
AUDIENCE: Well,
then, when you just

734
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:16,320
run through your difficulty
function between each two notes

735
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,854
and see if, for all the
potential moves, which

736
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:23,656
one minimizes that path.

737
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:25,060
PROFESSOR: Yep.

738
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,190
So basically, I'm assuming
I don't need this.

739
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,065
I'm assuming that.

740
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:31,440
This is going to
be where there's

741
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,989
at least one choice
where this is going

742
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,377
to have the same cost
as a direct note.

743
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:38,960
And then I'm going
to say that instead

744
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,260
of having more complex
shapes in the graph,

745
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,138
I'm going to insert
extra moves here.

746
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:46,679
AUDIENCE: OK.

747
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,053
I would think that, if you
have an intermediate move that

748
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,570
might be less expensive,
you should, like, just

749
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,411
hop to that new
position than to have

750
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:56,374
an intermediate move, right?

751
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:57,040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

752
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,375
And I'm going to assume that
either that's not the case,

753
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,500
or that I can always find
an intermediate move that

754
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,290
makes my life better.

755
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,564
AUDIENCE: Every case?

756
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:07,230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

757
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:14,255
PROFESSOR: These
results do work.

758
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,380
You'll have to take my word
for it that this works.

759
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,860
And this makes your
dynamic programming easy.

760
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,500
And it makes your
graph building easy.

761
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,370
So the advantage of this is
you're changing the input.

762
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,160
And then, when you're
building your graph

763
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,000
or when you're doing
the DP, you only

764
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,430
worry about an input
that looks like this.

765
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,720
You don't care about
any intermediate stuff.

766
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,270
You have notes, and you have to
transition between the notes.

767
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,240
Period.

768
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,365
So we reduce the
complexity of the problem.

769
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,740
So whenever you can get away
with that, it's really nice.

770
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,970
We can do that for centering.

771
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,530
We might not be able to do
it for other more complicated

772
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,029
stuff.

773
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,990
OK.

774
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,730
So, we sort of know
what we want in a state.

775
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,950
Now we want to build a
graph, so that the path

776
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,140
from some source
to some destination

777
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,970
has a cost that's equivalent to
the sum of these difficulties.

778
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,470
Right?

779
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,220
Because then I can
run the shortest path.

780
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,330
And my solution
will be right there.

781
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:17,830
I know.

782
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,950
You guys seem awfully sad.

783
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,970
Do you want to take a break
and play for a little bit more?

784
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,790
Yes?

785
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,797
How many people want
to play, instead of.

786
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,130
You don't have to play yourself.

787
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,720
You can just rest for
these two or three minutes.

788
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,220
And you can watch
someone else play.

789
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,311
And get more intuition about
how you're supposed to play.

790
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:40,240
OK.

791
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,820
So one person wants
to take a break.

792
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,110
Everyone else wants
to keep going?

793
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,440
Or are you guys
passed out already?

794
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,731
AUDIENCE: Can we get out early?

795
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,920
PROFESSOR: Sort of.

796
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,420
Yeah.

797
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,878
You'll get out
three minutes early,

798
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:55,410
if we don't do another round.

799
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,933
So who wants to keep going?

800
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:58,474
AUDIENCE: No.

801
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,057
Let's play.

802
00:37:01,057 --> 00:37:01,640
PROFESSOR: OK.

803
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,765
So who wants to keep going?

804
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:04,241
You can only vote on one thing.

805
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:04,990
Who wants to play?

806
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:08,838
AUDIENCE: OK.

807
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:09,463
AUDIENCE: Five.

808
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:10,960
AUDIENCE: Four.

809
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,100
AUDIENCE: Victor, go.

810
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,050
PROFESSOR: OK.

811
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,680
Who wants to go?

812
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,330
So we decided what we're
going to have in notes.

813
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,730
And we're going to
build a graph, where

814
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,200
the notes are the states.

815
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,830
And the edges are the moves.

816
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,630
Right?

817
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,300
So a note tells me, just
like there, what note I'm at.

818
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,440
Say I'm at note two.

819
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,440
And where my feet are on.

820
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,320
So, left foot left.

821
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,290
Right foot right.

822
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,270
So, given a state, what
outgoing edges do I build?

823
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,950
Where can I go to?

824
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,480
So let's say I have a state
that says I'm at note n

825
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,320
and my left foot is
in some position.

826
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,000
My right foot is
in some position.

827
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,656
What are my outgoing
edges from here?

828
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:58,340
AUDIENCE: Is there an
outgoing edge to every move?

829
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,497
Because there's a point.

830
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:00,080
PROFESSOR: OK.

831
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:05,660
Well, actually, the
blank is a note, right?

832
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,750
So if the next note, if
note three's a blank,

833
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,610
then the note is a blank.

834
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,464
And then I can have.

835
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:16,470
AUDIENCE: I guess,
isn't the difficulty

836
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,585
of the move dependent on what
note that blank actually is?

837
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,960
PROFESSOR: So, it doesn't
depend on what the screen says.

838
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,232
It depends on where my feet are.

839
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:27,940
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

840
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,464
I see.

841
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:29,880
PROFESSOR: So I
have a number that

842
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,690
tells me what's on my screen.

843
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,980
This number is
enough for me to know

844
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,610
what's going to be on my screen
from now on until forever.

845
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,080
Because I have the
list ahead of time.

846
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,010
And then I have the
position of my feet.

847
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,300
So these are both
part of the state.

848
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,310
So I have notes
for all the notes.

849
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,470
And all the positions
of the feet.

850
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,270
AUDIENCE: Right.

851
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:55,240
But the blank note is
just one position of feet?

852
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,010
PROFESSOR: No.

853
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,120
AUDIENCE: Or, it's
all positions.

854
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

855
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,124
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
difficulty dependent

856
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:01,014
on what position
your feet end up?

857
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:01,680
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

858
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,690
So it's from where I
start to where I land.

859
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:14,030
So, if I decide to start
from here, and go here,

860
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,080
the difficulty of this move
is-- so it doesn't depend on

861
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,520
whether I have a blank there.

862
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,450
And this was OK.

863
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,320
Or, if I had an up down,
then I just missed the note.

864
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,120
But the difficulty, the effort
I'm expending, is the same.

865
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
AUDIENCE: OK.

866
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,120
But if you start from that
other move and go to a different

867
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,150
position, that's--

868
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,060
PROFESSOR: If I go
from this to this,

869
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,747
then that's a
different difficulty.

870
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:38,609
AUDIENCE: But it still
could be a blank note?

871
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

872
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,025
So, a blank note will let
me go wherever I want.

873
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:43,630
AUDIENCE: I see.

874
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:49,098
But there are different kinds
of blank notes, with different--

875
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:50,717
I guess I'm confused
as to what--

876
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:51,300
PROFESSOR: OK.

877
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,591
So let's go through them again.

878
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:55,200
AUDIENCE: Is it kind of
like it's, like, spreading,

879
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,860
so really when you
have your source note,

880
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,660
it's actually connecting
to every possible move.

881
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,080
And every possible move is
connecting to your next--

882
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,913
so it's kind of like a
diamond shaped thing?

883
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:09,560
PROFESSOR: Not quite.

884
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,430
Not quite.

885
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,220
So, let's go through
the notes again.

886
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,730
And then let's go through that.

887
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:16,030
So the source move will be
connected to some notes.

888
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,280
And then those notes will
be connected to other notes.

889
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,490
And it looks more like you
have a big, outgoing degree.

890
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,836
Then you have a big network.

891
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:24,085
Then the big, incoming degree.

892
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:27,082
It looks like a messed
up sorting network.

893
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,165
So, notes are constraints.

894
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,230
This accepts any possible
feet combination, right?

895
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,830
So this accepts this.

896
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,312
AUDIENCE: Is the
first combination

897
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,782
contained in that note?

898
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:43,607
In that blank note?

899
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,190
PROFESSOR: No.

900
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,273
The blank is a constraint.

901
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,170
So, if I have a note that
looks like this, then

902
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,590
if one of my feet is here and
the other one is in the center,

903
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,750
then that's fine.

904
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,517
The constraint is met.

905
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,600
If one of my feet is up
and the other one is down,

906
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,110
then the constraint is met.

907
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,652
AUDIENCE: But the edge
running into that blank note,

908
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:09,976
depending on how your feet
land, is different difficulty.

909
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:10,944
Is that right?

910
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:12,410
PROFESSOR: Yep.

911
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,980
But when I compute
the edge width,

912
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,590
I need to know where
I'm landing exactly.

913
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,770
Not just where the note
is because the note might

914
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,250
admit multiple positions.

915
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,077
AUDIENCE: I see.

916
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:22,910
PROFESSOR: So this guy
admits all positions.

917
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,940
AUDIENCE: OK.

918
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,050
PROFESSOR: This guy admits
some positions, right?

919
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,140
These are l r, l r.

920
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,150
If I have up down, how many
feet positions does it admit?

921
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,115
AUDIENCE: Just one.

922
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:34,990
PROFESSOR: Not great.

923
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,830
AUDIENCE: No.

924
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,910
PROFESSOR: How many?

925
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,444
AUDIENCE: As an intermediate?

926
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:43,610
PROFESSOR: If it's up down,
then it's on the screen.

927
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,901
My intermediates are all blank.

928
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:45,654
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.

929
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:47,844
I thought you were
saying start with that.

930
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:48,760
PROFESSOR: So up down.

931
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,135
If you see up down
on the screen,

932
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,360
how many feet positions?

933
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
AUDIENCE: Left to right
what it could have.

934
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,420
PROFESSOR: Yep.

935
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,210
So, if the screen says up
down, the only two ways

936
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,740
I can do that is this.

937
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,440
Or this.

938
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,940
Right?

939
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,555
So, two positions.

940
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,346
AUDIENCE: I see.

941
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,637
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, but
you could have intermediate

942
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:05,850
where you step in the
first one, then back.

943
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,890
PROFESSOR: But I don't
care because I've

944
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,120
added these blank notes.

945
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,200
And they take care of
my intermediates for me.

946
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,700
AUDIENCE: But so,
we're saying where

947
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,804
the feet land aren't
part of the note.

948
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:18,470
PROFESSOR: Nope.

949
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,640
They're just states.

950
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,290
So they're a
decision I'm making.

951
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,816
AUDIENCE: So, do we
have the multiple-- no,

952
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:28,500
we don't because they're
not part of the--

953
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,620
PROFESSOR: For each
note position here,

954
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,960
for every position
in the screen thing,

955
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,540
I have multiple feet
positions that I could be in.

956
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,363
AUDIENCE: Right.

957
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:46,863
Right.

958
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:50,895
But then, are there multiple
moves to get to those?

959
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:51,520
PROFESSOR: Yep.

960
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,061
AUDIENCE: OK.

961
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:54,640
So there's multiple
moves connecting each.

962
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

963
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:04,230
So for example, if I want
to get to l r, up down here,

964
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,360
I can go from l r,
up down in the blank.

965
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,760
Or, I could have
l r be like this.

966
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,040
And then transition.

967
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,450
So I can have a lot of
possible foot positions

968
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,970
that I'm transitioning
from in order to get here.

969
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,640
AUDIENCE: But those
aren't actually

970
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,837
separate notes on the graph.

971
00:43:29,837 --> 00:43:30,670
PROFESSOR: They are.

972
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,620
They have to be.

973
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,260
So these all have to
be separate notes.

974
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,600
Because the edges are going
to have separate weights.

975
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,100
Right?

976
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,680
This edge is going
to have one weight.

977
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,160
This edge is going to
have another weight.

978
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,820
AUDIENCE: OK.

979
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,736
That's what I thought.

980
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:45,680
But then you said there
was only one blank.

981
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,912
Don't there have to be multiple
blank notes for every foot

982
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:55,610
thing.

983
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,485
If you're approaching
a note from different--

984
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,840
PROFESSOR: So, I'm not
sure what you're asking.

985
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,796
So, if you want to
care about centering,

986
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:08,420
if you want to have
intermediate moves,

987
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,060
you need one blank note
between every real note.

988
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,122
So that you're allowed to make
one intermediate move between.

989
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:16,788
AUDIENCE: Right.

990
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:21,184
I get that that's talking
about the on the screen.

991
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:21,850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

992
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,520
That's the screen.

993
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,180
AUDIENCE: That's the screen.

994
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,805
PROFESSOR: Yep.

995
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:24,430
AUDIENCE: OK.

996
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,350
So, that's not
the graph, though.

997
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,760
Here, we're talking about
the screen on the graph.

998
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,780
PROFESSOR: Here, we're
talking about the graph.

999
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,540
So two tells me that the
screen is at note two.

1000
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,370
Whatever that happens to be.

1001
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,760
And my feet are
in this position.

1002
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,700
OK.

1003
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,450
So that's very important.

1004
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,560
Thanks for asking because
that's very important.

1005
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,350
So, a state has the note
that I'm landing at.

1006
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,650
So, where the screen is.

1007
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,185
And where my feet are.

1008
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:51,497
AUDIENCE: OK.

1009
00:44:51,497 --> 00:44:52,080
PROFESSOR: OK.

1010
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,270
AUDIENCE: The state corresponds
to the nodes that you're on.

1011
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,020
PROFESSOR: A note.

1012
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,940
A note is a state.

1013
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,230
So, a note is a state.

1014
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,071
And a move goes
between two states.

1015
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:03,070
This is how we represent
all the graph problems.

1016
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,050
OK.

1017
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,834
AUDIENCE: So, you
need multiple blank.

1018
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:11,500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1019
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,390
So here, I'm just
drawing one example.

1020
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,010
Yeah.

1021
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:14,240
Yeah.

1022
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,000
So for example, here
I would need-- sorry.

1023
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,589
Oh, OK.

1024
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,630
I get your confusion now.

1025
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,129
So, yeah.

1026
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:20,930
This would be one move.

1027
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:24,210
This would be another move.

1028
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,796
AUDIENCE: That's all for a
single thing on the screen.

1029
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:27,420
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1030
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,286
AUDIENCE: OK.

1031
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:28,785
OK.

1032
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:29,695
That makes sense.

1033
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:32,028
AUDIENCE: So the next note
would have a really large end

1034
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:32,840
degree, right?

1035
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,540
I guess they always have--

1036
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,100
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

1037
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,800
It'd have lots of--

1038
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,385
PROFESSOR: So, this note
has a huge out degree.

1039
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:37,010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1040
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,237
But I'm saying the ones that all
those intermediates connect to.

1041
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:40,903
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1042
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:42,030
AUDIENCE: So, then,
they would connect

1043
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,801
with some note that have,
like, really large degree.

1044
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:44,284
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1045
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,450
AUDIENCE: But there's two
of them after that, right?

1046
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,295
Because there would
be two different--

1047
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:49,420
PROFESSOR: So, what's next?

1048
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,830
Next, is position, hmm.

1049
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,210
How did U number them?

1050
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,452
I guess, crap.

1051
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:03,610
No.

1052
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,080
It's not going to
match that, so.

1053
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,450
Whatever we do, it's
not going to match that.

1054
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,370
Say the next note,
4, is just an up.

1055
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:19,890
4 is up down.

1056
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,880
And then I have two
notes for it, right?

1057
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,800
Wild One note, l r.

1058
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,830
So this is note 4.

1059
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,060
That happens to be up down.

1060
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,270
And then I have this.

1061
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:40,767
And every one of these
connects to every one of these.

1062
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,350
AUDIENCE: If the
next move is up down,

1063
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,561
how can notes have down up?

1064
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:45,060
Oh, because you can
switch the feet.

1065
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,556
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1066
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:46,097
AUDIENCE: Oh.

1067
00:46:48,524 --> 00:46:49,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1068
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,773
So, I aimed to ask you guys, how
am I going to draw the edges?

1069
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:54,490
But you guys made me
do it with questions.

1070
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,040
So, suppose I met note n, l, r.

1071
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,760
What edges do I draw
going out of it?

1072
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,914
So, note n, left foot
at some position.

1073
00:47:01,914 --> 00:47:03,080
Right foot at some position.

1074
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,420
What are my outgoing edges?

1075
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,100
AUDIENCE: This is a
note on the screen.

1076
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,620
Or--

1077
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:09,860
PROFESSOR: In the graph.

1078
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,693
AUDIENCE: --the new one
or intermediate one?

1079
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:12,850
PROFESSOR: Doesn't matter.

1080
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:15,106
So, intermediate notes
have a note blank.

1081
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:16,480
AUDIENCE: That's
just everything.

1082
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,688
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter.

1083
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:20,720
Yeah, we're looking at all
of them at the same time.

1084
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,170
AUDIENCE: Wait, so
you're asking what are--

1085
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,320
PROFESSOR: So, given this note,
who am I connecting it to?

1086
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,510
Let's draw the outgoing edges.

1087
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,960
So, if you're solving
this as a graph problem,

1088
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,860
you build the notes.

1089
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,990
You draw the edges.

1090
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,471
You're on some algorithm.

1091
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:35,470
So let's draw the edges.

1092
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:40,481
AUDIENCE: I think it depends
if you're an intermediate note

1093
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,780
or not.

1094
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,600
PROFESSOR: Nope.

1095
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,190
So the note tells you
what your constraints are.

1096
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,830
And that covers
intermediate notes.

1097
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,099
If you're note is a blank, then,
well, there's no constraints.

1098
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:54,390
If the note is not a blank,
then there are constraints.

1099
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,639
AUDIENCE: Oh, note.

1100
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,830
I thought that was referring
to the note, not the--

1101
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:57,413
PROFESSOR: No.

1102
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:58,860
So this is a note.

1103
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,400
Maybe n is not good.

1104
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,702
Let's use i, instead, then.

1105
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:04,890
If n is hard.

1106
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,647
So, i is the position
here, in this guy.

1107
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:09,146
Right?

1108
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,015
Say for example,
i equals 1 here.

1109
00:48:14,015 --> 00:48:15,090
I equals 2 here.

1110
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:15,760
I equals 3 here.

1111
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,270
So and so forth.

1112
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,673
And that doesn't match this, so.

1113
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,172
AUDIENCE: We're
talking about note--

1114
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:21,797
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1115
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:23,570
AUDIENCE: --not--

1116
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,260
PROFESSOR: If one
note is represented

1117
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,510
by these three numbers, right?

1118
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,825
Each note has this tuple in it.

1119
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:29,495
AUDIENCE: Then i is the note.

1120
00:48:29,495 --> 00:48:30,120
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1121
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,028
AUDIENCE: So i
connects to i plus 1.

1122
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:34,097
And then all
possibilities known.

1123
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:34,680
PROFESSOR: OK.

1124
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,610
So this connects to i plus 1.

1125
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,880
And then all possible
destinations, right?

1126
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,380
So I'm going to say left.

1127
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,360
This is after the jump.

1128
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,630
So, left after the jump,
and right after the jump.

1129
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:54,340
And this is for all
possible left after a jump,

1130
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,710
right after the jump.

1131
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,780
And lost a weight on this edge.

1132
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,940
AUDIENCE: The way
that it's from--

1133
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,728
AUDIENCE: l r to

1134
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:08,997
AUDIENCE: --l r to l r.

1135
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:10,080
AUDIENCE: l j-- l sub j r.

1136
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,770
AUDIENCE: l r.

1137
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:16,850
PROFESSOR: So you want to
say from l r to l j, r j.

1138
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,855
But what?

1139
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:19,980
AUDIENCE: Difficulty level?

1140
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,646
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1141
00:49:20,646 --> 00:49:21,922
Where is that?

1142
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:23,380
AUDIENCE: Your
difficulty function.

1143
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,424
PROFESSOR: Which is?

1144
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:25,090
AUDIENCE: Delta.

1145
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,350
PROFESSOR: Delta.

1146
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:27,850
So, yeah.

1147
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,710
The weight is delta.

1148
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,220
I drew d.

1149
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,880
Delta of these two
foot positions.

1150
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,660
Almost.

1151
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,260
If I want to minimize the
difficulty, then this is right.

1152
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,040
If I want to maximize
a score, then I

1153
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,404
would have to add a minus sign.

1154
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,070
But if you're minimizing
the difficulty,

1155
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,520
this is exactly the way because
it maps the shortest path.

1156
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,302
Usually, in dynamic programming,
things are maximized.

1157
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:57,586
AUDIENCE: Wait, why would
you add a minus if it's--

1158
00:49:57,586 --> 00:49:59,460
PROFESSOR: So, if we're
maximizing something,

1159
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,165
we have to flip-- we have to
add a minus to the edge costs

1160
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:02,665
because--

1161
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:03,520
AUDIENCE: Right.

1162
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:03,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1163
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,590
But this time we're
minimizing something.

1164
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:05,802
AUDIENCE: Oh.

1165
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:06,580
Right, right, right.

1166
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,260
PROFESSOR: I promised you
that we'll maximize something

1167
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,730
all the time.

1168
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,630
Well, I guess I lied.

1169
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,084
AUDIENCE: OK.

1170
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:10,538
Right, right, right.

1171
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:12,162
AUDIENCE: You don't
want to maximize d.

1172
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:13,720
Then you're dead.

1173
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,439
PROFESSOR: No.

1174
00:50:14,439 --> 00:50:15,730
You want to maximize show offs.

1175
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,090
So if we have the
entertainment thing,

1176
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,210
then that would be maximized.

1177
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,290
And then you'd have minus.

1178
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,136
AUDIENCE: Then you'd
have everything you need.

1179
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:20,761
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1180
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:21,611
AUDIENCE: OK.

1181
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,110
PROFESSOR: OK, so
we're almost good.

1182
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,630
Source notes and
destination notes.

1183
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,046
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess source, we

1184
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:30,142
know that means
start in the middle.

1185
00:50:30,142 --> 00:50:30,642
Right?

1186
00:50:30,642 --> 00:50:33,720
Like, you would start off with--

1187
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,329
PROFESSOR: What's the source?

1188
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:37,120
You want to start at
the first note, right?

1189
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1190
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,581
PROFESSOR: But in
which position?

1191
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:42,265
AUDIENCE: Well, in
the center, right?

1192
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:43,988
I mean, the [INAUDIBLE] start.

1193
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:45,196
Or, I guess you could start--

1194
00:50:45,196 --> 00:50:47,699
AUDIENCE: Wherever you want.

1195
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,240
AUDIENCE: Could you
add a source note

1196
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,060
going to a bunch of
intermediate notes?

1197
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,180
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1198
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:52,680
Yeah.

1199
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,510
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say there is a note 0.

1200
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,475
That let's me choose
how I'm going to start.

1201
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:01,100
AUDIENCE: Oh, it
could be any position.

1202
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,890
It's like an
intermediate note itself.

1203
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,515
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1204
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,690
So I'm going to have a note
0, with all possible foot

1205
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,760
positions.

1206
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,540
And then this is going to
be connected to a source,

1207
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,087
by edges of weight 0.

1208
00:51:18,087 --> 00:51:20,670
So the intuition is that I get
to choose my starting position,

1209
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,710
right?

1210
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,360
Starting position.

1211
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,440
I see the first note.

1212
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,020
I make a move.

1213
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,280
So I want to be able to
choose the starting position.

1214
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,820
That's why I have
all those notes.

1215
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,370
And then make a move to
touch the first note.

1216
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,322
AUDIENCE: The starting
position is also a note.

1217
00:51:38,322 --> 00:51:39,820
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1218
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,490
Because, if the
first note is here,

1219
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,500
I don't necessarily
want to start like this

1220
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,820
because maybe this
is harder than this.

1221
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:52,795
All right.

1222
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:53,753
What's the destination?

1223
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:58,400
AUDIENCE: The last note.

1224
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,930
PROFESSOR: OK.

1225
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,790
So, all the notes that are at
note n, and have any position,

1226
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,720
would be connected to
a destination note,

1227
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,660
using an edge of weight 0.

1228
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,510
Or I can consider
them as destinations.

1229
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:16,340
And then choose the destination
that has the shortest path.

1230
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,580
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

1231
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:23,320
The final destination is
going to be, like, two notes.

1232
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:23,820
Right?

1233
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,242
It's going to be that
last position, and then--

1234
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,866
PROFESSOR: Or it
might be more than two

1235
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:29,900
if the note is
just a simple note.

1236
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,030
Because that wouldn't
constrain my feet too much.

1237
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,530
OK.

1238
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:34,770
And last, last question.

1239
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,382
Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford?

1240
00:52:36,382 --> 00:52:37,840
AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford,
because you

1241
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,235
have negative edges,
negative weight,

1242
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:45,130
as if you were going
to maximize to death.

1243
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,060
PROFESSOR: So, this is always
going to be from 0 to 1.

1244
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,490
So I could possibly
use Dijkstra.

1245
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,550
The answer is neither.

1246
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,175
The answer is, we're
building a DAG, so.

1247
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:54,966
AUDIENCE: Dijkstra.

1248
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:56,730
AUDIENCE: We don't use that.

1249
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,980
PROFESSOR: DAG, shortest path.

1250
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,350
Every time we have
dynamic programming, DAG,

1251
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,820
shortest path.

1252
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,320
OK?

1253
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,240
AUDIENCE: Question.

1254
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,160
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1255
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,360
Come on, last question.

1256
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,000
You can't get away that easily.

1257
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,550
OK, so.

1258
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,400
Who wants to play?
