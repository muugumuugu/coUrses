8
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:23,170
PROFESSOR: OK so any
pointed questions

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,455
before we go over blackjack?

10
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:27,955
AUDIENCE: Before
you start blackjack

11
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:31,820
can you go through
the rules again?

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,240
PROFESSOR: The
rules of the game?

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,823
AUDIENCE: Yes.

14
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:34,680
PROFESSOR: OK.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,240
Well I'm going to
do something better

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,448
than going through the rules.

17
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:39,060
I'm going to abstract
the rules away.

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,240
So I'm going to say that
a game of blackjack has,

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,300
let's start here.

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,520
So a game of
blackjack has a deck.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,590
And we have x-ray vision
or some other illegal way

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,640
in which we know what the deck
looks like from the beginning.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,103
How many cards in a deck?

24
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:06,950
AUDIENCE: 52.

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,380
PROFESSOR: OK.

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,455
So say from 0 to 51 because
we like zero-based indexing.

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,100
So the way that the game
starts is you get two cards,

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,640
the dealer gets two cards.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,780
What is the only decision
that you make in the game

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,490
if you already have
perfect information?

31
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,830
So you know the deck already.

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,330
You don't need to
wait for each card

33
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,730
to know what it's going to be.

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,890
So as the game starts you
have to make one decision.

35
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,232
What's that decision?

36
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,190
AUDIENCE: Hit or stand.

37
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,970
PROFESSOR: Well
that's assuming you

38
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,404
care what you get each time.

39
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:46,820
So if you have to
look at the card

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,300
then you have to decide each
time if you hit or stand.

41
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
If you know all the
cards in advance--

42
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,750
AUDIENCE: How much to bet?

43
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,967
PROFESSOR: I think our
game has that fixed.

44
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,050
AUDIENCE: When to restart?

45
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,300
PROFESSOR: So it
is hit or stand,

46
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,120
but I want to restate that.

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,560
Because you don't actually
have to decide after every card

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,195
if you want to hit or stand.

49
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:07,320
You know what the cards
are going to be in advance.

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,984
AUDIENCE: When to restart?

51
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:10,150
Like how many cards to pick?

52
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,290
PROFESSOR: How
many cards to pick.

53
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,954
Yeah that's pretty
much the same thing.

54
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:16,120
So you don't have to decide
every time hit or stand,

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,161
you know ahead of time I
want to hit three times,

56
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,255
or I want to hit once.

57
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,630
Because you know
the entire deck.

58
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,540
You don't need to actually
look at the cards.

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,317
So each game the only
decision that I make is--

60
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,150
suppose this is one
game-- the only decision

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,880
that I have is h, how many
cards I'm going to hit.

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,060
Right?

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,660
And then after I
make this decision

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,360
the game will eat up some cards.

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,380
I get two cards, the
dealer gets two cards,

66
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,320
then I hit some cards then
the dealer gets some cards.

67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,950
And this is the number of
cards that have been consumed.

68
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:58,930
Some number of cards that
were played in this game.

69
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,730
And the other thing
that comes out of it

70
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,090
is how much money I make.

71
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,510
For our simple rules it's
either I make $1, or nothing,

72
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,026
or I lose $1.

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,730
Fair enough?

74
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,430
Everyone follows?

75
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,800
So I'm going to abstract
all this in a helper method.

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,580
I'm going to say that I have
a method called round outcome.

77
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,470
Where I say, look out
of the entire deck

78
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,070
I'm going to start at card i, so
this is where my round starts.

79
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,430
So I tell it which
cards I start at.

80
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,820
And how many cards
I'm going to hit.

81
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,400
And it gives me back a
tuple, where the first item

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,130
is how many cards are played.

83
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,080
So number of cards played.

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,730
And the second item in the tuple
is how much money do I make.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,130
h is how many cards
I'm going to hit.

86
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,050
So i says that I already
played this many cards

87
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,910
in previous games.

88
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,660
So a game starts
with a full deck.

89
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,529
And then I play some rounds.

90
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,320
Each round I do a whole
exchange with the dealer, where

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,730
I hit some cards, and then
the dealer hits some cards.

92
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,930
And then I win or
lose some money.

93
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,719
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
why h and cp are different.

94
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,010
PROFESSOR: So cp is how many
cards are played in total.

95
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,880
And this looks at
the initial cards.

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,050
So first I get two cards,
the dealer gets two cards.

97
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,240
And then after I hit some cards
the dealer also has to hit.

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,410
And the dealer has a pretty
find algorithm, right?

99
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,240
So the number of
cards played includes

100
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,480
the cards that were
dealt initially

101
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,360
and the cars that the
dealer has to hit.

102
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,880
So this little thing has all the
blackjack rules encoded in it.

103
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,650
Everything is already there.

104
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,400
AUDIENCE: So blackjack,
that's roughly 2h?

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,620
cp is 2h, something like that?

106
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,005
PROFESSOR: 4 plus 2h maybe.

107
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:13,880
Because you get two
cards, he gets two cards,

108
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,975
and if you both deal
h on average then--

109
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,480
AUDIENCE: So is cp the
number of cards this round?

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,646
PROFESSOR: This round, yeah.

111
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,944
OK so intuitively
I already know,

112
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,360
so I already know
the entire deck.

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,450
So the decision that
I have to make is,

114
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,590
would I play
optimally every round?

115
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,580
Or do I want to maybe
lose the first round

116
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,620
and leave some good
cards for later?

117
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,390
So I have to figure
out how many cards I'm

118
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,560
going to hit each time so
that overall I make the most

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,530
amount of money when
I leave the table.

120
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,890
And when I run out of
cards I leave the table.

121
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,770
The dealer says
shows over, gotta go.

122
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,220
Do the rules make sense?

123
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,650
OK so I propose we
approach this in two ways.

124
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,427
First we model it
as a graph problem,

125
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,260
because we've already
done this a few times.

126
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,580
And then we model it as a
dynamic programming problem.

127
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,630
And we see how the
two are related.

128
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,110
Make sense?

129
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,820
Is this too simple for everyone?

130
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,150
You guys already get everything?

131
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,290
So how would I model
this is a graph problem?

132
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,212
AUDIENCE: Do you
already know the order

133
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,117
that you're going to
get all these cards in?

134
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,370
PROFESSOR: Yep.

135
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,300
AUDIENCE: So I in
lecture we briefly

136
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,220
talked about having
your starting node go

137
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,940
to a bunch of other
nodes that would

138
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,096
be your potential
next move, and then

139
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,012
you just calculate your
shortest path distance

140
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,940
from there to the x value.

141
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,320
PROFESSOR: So that's
the general approach.

142
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,980
How do we do this for cards?

143
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,210
So what would be nodes?

144
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,580
What are the most intuitive
nodes you could think about?

145
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,880
OK maybe intuitive for me.

146
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,640
So nodes show our state, right?

147
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,014
Show the state that the
game is currently in.

148
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:22,514
Sorry?

149
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:23,490
AUDIENCE: Your hand.

150
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,760
Like your current cards.

151
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,190
Is that your state?

152
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:34,040
So from I guess 2 to ace.

153
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,910
PROFESSOR: From?

154
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,860
AUDIENCE: From 2 to ace, in
terms of the number of choices

155
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,360
you have.

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,860
PROFESSOR: OK so
the problem is you

157
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,122
have four cards of
each type, right?

158
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:46,330
And you don't know where
they show up and everything.

159
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,380
So I think this my code
more complicated than it

160
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,854
needs to be.

161
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,916
AUDIENCE: Like the rest
of the cards in the deck

162
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,310
that are remaining?

163
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,155
PROFESSOR: OK.

164
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,750
AUDIENCE: Is that
a good [INAUDIBLE]?

165
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,630
PROFESSOR: How many cars I
have left in the deck, right?

166
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,460
So basically I would have one
node for each of the cards

167
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,320
here.

168
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,650
And that says I start a
new game at this card.

169
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,960
OK so I'm going to
draw some circles.

170
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,450
Say these are our nodes.

171
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,390
Maybe I draw a bit
too many of them.

172
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,291
Where do we always start?

173
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,290
AUDIENCE: The left side.

174
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,456
PROFESSOR: First one, right?

175
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:33,940
We start with 52 cards.

176
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:41,570
So circle 0 means that we played
0 cards, we have 52 cards left.

177
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,362
When do we draw an
edge between nodes?

178
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,320
What does an edge mean?

179
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,120
AUDIENCE: That's how
many cards you've chosen,

180
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,810
so the number cp.

181
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,710
PROFESSOR: OK so the number cp.

182
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,580
It means I played a game, right?

183
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,220
So one edge is a game.

184
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,610
And it goes from one
state to the next state.

185
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,990
So if I'm, say I'm at node i.

186
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
How do I draw the edges?

187
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,770
Say I'm somewhere here.

188
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,814
So I already played i cards.

189
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:19,480
AUDIENCE: Iterate
through all h's, cp's.

190
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,850
PROFESSOR: OK.

191
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,082
So for h in what to what?

192
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,610
What's the smallest h?

193
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,992
AUDIENCE: The smallest h is 1.

194
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:31,430
PROFESSOR: Really?

195
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,905
Do I have to hit?

196
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:36,390
AUDIENCE: Wait isn't it 4?

197
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,145
Because you're
always dealing out 4.

198
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,520
PROFESSOR: Yes, so I might as
well not count them, right?

199
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,790
So h is how many cards I hit
after the initial ones were

200
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,050
dealt.

201
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,340
So that I can start at 0,
a nice and easy number.

202
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,542
And where do I end?

203
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,375
Rough approximation.

204
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,060
AUDIENCE: You could go to
infinity and then break.

205
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,200
It's still 11 because 11 at
most-- oh no, 11 minus 4, 6.

206
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,990
You need to know the
rules of the game.

207
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,320
PROFESSOR: OK if you know the
rules of the game it's that.

208
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,071
If you don't know the rules
of the game it's 52 minus i.

209
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,200
OK so what's first thing I do?

210
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,940
So how do I draw an
edge representing

211
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,570
a game where I hold h cards?

212
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,550
AUDIENCE: So you draw an
edge from your current place

213
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,800
to the output of round
outcome with the 0 element.

214
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,680
PROFESSOR: So then let's
store this output somewhere.

215
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,220
Let's say o is round outcome.

216
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,540
What do I give round outcome?

217
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,392
AUDIENCE: i and h.

218
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,850
PROFESSOR: See I
picked good names.

219
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,620
They're exactly
what I have there.

220
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,520
So I draw an edge
from i to what?

221
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:06,900
AUDIENCE: To the output of
round outcome, which is o.

222
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,397
So it's 0.

223
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:08,980
PROFESSOR: OK.

224
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,574
AUDIENCE: Or that
the node at o is 0.

225
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,240
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

226
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,890
So suppose I'm at i
and I've already played

227
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,520
five cards, right?

228
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,050
So say i equals 5, for example.

229
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,340
And I know that if I hit
once the dealer will also

230
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,100
have to hit once.

231
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,250
So in total I've played 6 cards.

232
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,310
And suppose I won.

233
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,280
Then the output
would look like this.

234
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,520
6 cards were played and I won.

235
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,040
So plus 1.

236
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,800
So I would draw an
edge from 5 to what?

237
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

238
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,480
PROFESSOR: OK, from
5 to 11 hopefully.

239
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,930
So what's 11?

240
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:07,490
11 is 5 plus all of 0.

241
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,950
OK, what am I missing there?

242
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,925
AUDIENCE: i to i
plus [INAUDIBLE].

243
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:18,550
PROFESSOR: Yep.

244
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,230
So this tells me how many
cards I played in this game.

245
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,140
I want to look at
each game separately.

246
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,200
I don't want to have to keep
track of previous states.

247
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,770
So this output is
localized to this game.

248
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,720
It tells me how
many cards have been

249
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,620
drawn in this game in total.

250
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,310
And how much money
I made in this game.

251
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,200
If I already played i cards
before starting the game,

252
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,550
after I play all of 0, the total
number of cards is i plus 0.

253
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,720
Tiny detail, but you'd
probably lose a point off

254
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,680
of an exam or something
if you forget it.

255
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
OK so keep track of your state.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,170
It makes sense to write
down this is my state,

257
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,920
and then make sure that
you're always representing it.

258
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,310
So what's the cost of the edge?

259
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,120
And then our answer would
be what path do I want?

260
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,400
I want to make the
most amount of money,

261
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,600
so that's the longest path.

262
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,730
How do I convert this to
a shortest path problem,

263
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,950
because this is what
you know how to solve?

264
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,084
Where I put it?

265
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:42,530
AUDIENCE: There.

266
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,060
PROFESSOR: Good answer, there.

267
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,010
Right there.

268
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,300
OK so this builds
the graph, then

269
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,810
I run some algorithm on it.

270
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,210
What's the best algorithm
I can run on it?

271
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,090
AUDIENCE: Dykstra because
you can [INAUDIBLE].

272
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,450
But you can add everything on.

273
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,518
The lowest negative edge
weight is 1, or negative 1.

274
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,734
PROFESSOR: Are there
negative cycles?

275
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,694
AUDIENCE: No.

276
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,360
PROFESSOR: Everything
goes right, right?

277
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,130
So even if I don't
get hit any card,

278
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,620
at least four cards
will be played.

279
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,400
So all these arrows go right.

280
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,230
So then I heard a
fancy term that I like.

281
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,320
Can someone say it again?

282
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,250
What's this graph?

283
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,190
AUDIENCE: DAG.

284
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,170
PROFESSOR: DAG.

285
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,670
All the edges go one way.

286
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,030
So this is a DAG.

287
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,385
And that means that I
can run what algorithm?

288
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,044
Sorry?

289
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

290
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,570
PROFESSOR: Topological
sort plus DFS,

291
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,080
the one that we talked about
last time when everyone was out

292
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,365
for Thanksgiving.

293
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,740
So you have to
believe me that it

294
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,850
exists, or look
at lecture notes.

295
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,180
So top sort plus
DFS will give me

296
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,000
the shortest path in
order of V plus E.

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,240
So this is better than Dykstra,
which is E plus V log V. OK?

298
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,790
OK I'm guessing
most of you don't

299
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,040
know how that algorithm works.

300
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,415
Well good news,
we're going to do

301
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,860
this using dynamic programming.

302
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,622
So we're going to represent
the graph implicitly.

303
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,080
And we're going to
write everything

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,270
without needing to
know the algorithm.

305
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,860
If you know it, it helps because
you can see how they relate.

306
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,800
But if you don't we should still
be able to solve the problem.

307
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,900
But before we do that, does
everyone understand this?

308
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,680
Some nods would be nice
so that I can feel good.

309
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,180
Yes?

310
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,680
Almost?

311
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,095
OK.

312
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:54,595
Questions?

313
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,700
AUDIENCE: Like the
number 5 there,

314
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,070
that's only if you hit, right?

315
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,070
Or that's the number
of cards remaining.

316
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,054
Is there a particular
reason you picked 5?

317
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,970
PROFESSOR: So I was
choosing an example for i.

318
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,160
So good question,
what does i mean?

319
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,130
So this means I'm-- assume
that I'm starting a game.

320
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,778
So starting-- sorry, a round.

321
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,380
A new round.

322
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:36,400
And I have already played i
cards in the previous round.

323
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,120
So I started a new round
and the first 5 cards

324
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,960
are out of the deck.

325
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,510
What's the best
strategy I can have?

326
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,273
What's the most
money I can make?

327
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,125
AUDIENCE: But there's
some nodes that

328
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,050
connect to the next card
over that won't necessarily

329
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,972
end the game, so
there aren't going

330
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:01,326
to be any earnings, right?

331
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,901
You could have 5 connect
to 6, and that wouldn't--

332
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,150
PROFESSOR: Here I'm just
trying to emphasize the point

333
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,700
that all the edges move,
all the edges point forward.

334
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,280
But yeah, the edges have to
go at least across four nodes.

335
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,610
So assume there are some
more nodes around here.

336
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,151
AUDIENCE: OK.

337
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:23,768
PROFESSOR: Yes?

338
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,143
AUDIENCE: You were
saying how you

339
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:25,960
have to be careful
with something

340
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,430
or else you'll lose a point.

341
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,900
What was that?

342
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,080
PROFESSOR: How you
draw your edges.

343
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,184
Or when we switch to
dynamic programming, what

344
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,350
you write in your recursion.

345
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,320
OK so last chance
to ask a question

346
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,070
before we do a conceptual jump
and use another algorithm.

347
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,474
OK how do we do this using
the dynamic programming?

348
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,390
So what are we going to
have instead of nodes?

349
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,100
Sorry?

350
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,790
Well so you still have
states in both cases.

351
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,400
But here you represent
them with nodes in a graph.

352
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,490
In dynamic programming you
represent them using-- yeah,

353
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,240
the states are
basically sub-problems.

354
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,850
And what do we, when we
compute stuff, what do we use?

355
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,030
Numbers is a vector
or in a matrix.

356
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,690
So there's no
graph to work with.

357
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,710
There are no extra
algorithms to call.

358
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,020
We just straight up
compute to the numbers,

359
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,430
we trade the answers
to the problem.

360
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,790
So we're going to have an array.

361
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:55,740
How many elements in the array?

362
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,960
Can anyone guess?

363
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,380
All right, I heard 52.

364
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,650
If I'm at element i, say i
equals 5 because we used that

365
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,041
before, what does this represent
in the dynamic programming

366
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,540
formulation?

367
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,940
It's very similar
to node 5 there.

368
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,930
So what does it represent?

369
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,110
The fact that we're
starting a game after we

370
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,252
played the first five cards.

371
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,960
Sorry, we're starting
a round after we've

372
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,340
played the first 5 cards.

373
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,860
And we want to maximize
our earnings from here on.

374
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,120
So then the problem
is, how do we

375
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,030
maximize our earnings
starting here?

376
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:51,160
So given that the
deck has these cards,

377
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,420
so the cards from 5 to 51.

378
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,010
What's the maximum
amount of money

379
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,590
we can make by
playing optimally?

380
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,710
So maximum number
of money we can

381
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:17,190
win by playing optimally,
starting around at card i.

382
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,515
Starting at i.

383
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,680
So if I want to compute
this-- by the way, speaking

384
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,210
of bad variable names,
we did this before.

385
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,410
When people don't know
how to name this array

386
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,550
they name it dpi.

387
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,670
I think we did that in our PSet.

388
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,919
So this is the most useless
name you can have for the array.

389
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,210
It just tells you that we're
using dynamic programming.

390
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,810
But it doesn't really
tell you what it means.

391
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,730
So we're going to go
for it, because it's

392
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,540
nice and easy to write.

393
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,180
So if I want to compute
dp of i, how do I do that?

394
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,057
AUDIENCE: x
[INAUDIBLE] problems.

395
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,890
PROFESSOR: OK, so what
are the sub-problems?

396
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,440
AUDIENCE: The
function at i's past 5

397
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,320
where the i's are [INAUDIBLE]
through this manner.

398
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,010
PROFESSOR: OK so I'd want to
have something very similar

399
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,500
to this, right?

400
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,710
What are my decisions?

401
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,860
So what are my choices?

402
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,824
What do I iterate over?

403
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,667
AUDIENCE: How many hits.

404
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,000
PROFESSOR: Yep, exactly the
same thing as before, right?

405
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,920
Starting a node at i.

406
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,100
I was starting a node at i here.

407
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,670
So the choices are
exactly the same.

408
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,220
So I'm going to start
by looking at this line.

409
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,500
Do I need to make any changes?

410
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,880
Or do I copy straight over?

411
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,930
So this is the algorithm
for computing dp of i.

412
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,150
For i in 0 to 52.

413
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,550
Sorry h in 52 minus i.

414
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,050
All right.

415
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,410
I hope we can do a
bit better than that.

416
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,941
AUDIENCE: So we know that
it's a max of 6, right?

417
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:29,200
So can we just put
that in instead?

418
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,680
That's given the rules.

419
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,890
PROFESSOR: Sure.

420
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,170
If you're smart you can.

421
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,910
I'm not, so I'm
just writing this.

422
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,340
So this helper function
that I have here,

423
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,060
that I call the
magic that implements

424
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,980
the rules of bag
check will save me.

425
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,270
So if I say that oh, I
want to hit 10 times,

426
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,970
and that's impossible,
then it'll probably give me

427
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,860
an earning of minus
infinity, which makes sure

428
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,390
I never choose that path.

429
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,650
So all that is hidden in there.

430
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,880
You're smart enough in
blackjack so you can write 6.

431
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,370
I'm not so I can't.

432
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,660
So 52 minus i.

433
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,600
OK what I do next?

434
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,770
Do I copy this next line?

435
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,900
Or do I change it?

436
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,940
Yeah let's copy it over.

437
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,440
Sounds good.

438
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,540
How about this?

439
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,780
Do I copy this?

440
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,470
Trick question.

441
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,210
Come on guys.

442
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,320
So do I copy this line or not?

443
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,290
Do I have a graph here?

444
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,130
Can I draw edges?

445
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,630
OK so I'm not going to copy it.

446
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,150
What do I do instead?

447
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,180
By trick I mean easy.

448
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,607
So what do I do instead?

449
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:55,815
I compute my answer directly.

450
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:06,715
So if I hit h cards,
what am I looking at?

451
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:09,722
AUDIENCE: Do you
mean like a function?

452
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:10,930
PROFESSOR: A function, sorry?

453
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,910
AUDIENCE: You add the
dp of o 1 or of o 0.

454
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,950
PROFESSOR: OK so first
let's see if I have i cards,

455
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,010
and say I hit, I do the same
exact thing that I did before.

456
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,470
I look at i is 5 and h equals 2.

457
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,760
So then that function gives
me the same answer, 6 1.

458
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,420
So then I know that after this
I'm going to end up in a state

459
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,490
where I played the
first 11 cards.

460
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,445
So I'm going to end up at 11.

461
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,750
How much money did
I make overall?

462
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,000
OK, so 1 in this case.

463
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:12,230
So how much money I made is
o of-- I think it's o of 1.

464
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:21,050
And after I land here, how
much money I'm going to make?

465
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,314
Assuming I'm still
playing optimally.

466
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

467
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,580
PROFESSOR: dp i plus.

468
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:36,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

469
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,360
OK.

470
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,290
So i plus o of 0 is
used to compute--

471
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,410
so dp of i plus o of 0 is
used to compute dp of i.

472
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,990
This is the same thing as--

473
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,027
AUDIENCE: dp is a function here?

474
00:25:58,027 --> 00:25:58,610
PROFESSOR: No.

475
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,420
So you're wondering
what the hell?

476
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,520
Why will that work, right?

477
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,320
Let's get to that in a minute.

478
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,030
That will work, we
have to make it work.

479
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,450
So here I'm drawing an edge
from i to i plus o of 0.

480
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,870
And the cost of the
edge is minus o of 1.

481
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,260
So here we're looking at edges.

482
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,750
Here I'm assuming
that they already

483
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,370
computed the answer here
using some black magic.

484
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,390
It's already available.

485
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,290
And I want to compute
the answer here.

486
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,370
So I have the cost of the
edge plus whatever I had here.

487
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,200
So if, suppose I know
that if I start here

488
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,340
and I finish the
deck, I can make $20.

489
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,480
So suppose I know
that this is 20.

490
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,730
What will the answer be here?

491
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,690
1 plus 20 which is?

492
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,770
So if I hit-- how many times
did I say there-- if I hit twice

493
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,920
I guess I'll make 21.

494
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,780
So this is a possible answer.

495
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,570
And I have to go over
all possible answers.

496
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,880
So this is how much I'm making
if I hit h cards, right?

497
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,810
Now I'm looking at
multiple choices here.

498
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,310
This is the answer
for each choice.

499
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,450
Which answer do I
want in the end?

500
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,330
The largest.

501
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,340
OK.

502
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,860
So let's say I'm going to
start with a choices array that

503
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,730
stores all the answers.

504
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,970
So here I'm just going
to pend the answer,

505
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,200
the possible answer.

506
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,470
Choices append this guy.

507
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,200
And then at the
end of the for loop

508
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,820
I'm going to take
the max of choices,

509
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,370
and I'm going to
assign it where?

510
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

511
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,750
PROFESSOR: So I promised I'm
going to compute dp of i.

512
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,690
I just finished
computing dp of i.

513
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,380
Now there's a
little problem here.

514
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,960
In order to compute
this guy, I need

515
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,240
to already have the
answer for this guy.

516
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,730
And maybe for some
other guys here.

517
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,790
So an answer here depends
on future answers.

518
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,810
The arrows here are the same
as the arrows here, right?

519
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,760
They represent possible
moves in the game.

520
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,540
At the same time the arrows
here represent dependencies.

521
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,580
This answer depends
on this answer,

522
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,234
this answer depends on this
answer, so on and so forth.

523
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:02,650
When we hear the
word dependencies

524
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,483
what do we think of?

525
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,670
Topological sort.

526
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,730
PSet, which one?

527
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,180
PSet 6 still brings
painful memories?

528
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,860
Not anymore.

529
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,580
We have a new one.

530
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,660
So in order to
compute this I need

531
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,610
to compute the answer to
a few other sub-problems.

532
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,870
To make sure that I have these
answers ready by the time

533
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,640
I compute this.

534
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,223
So to make sure that
this code doesn't

535
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:31,290
crash I have to compute all
the answers to the sub-problems

536
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,480
in the topological sort order.

537
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,830
That's where topological
sort fits in here.

538
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,510
What's an obvious
topological sort,

539
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,794
if all the edges are
pointing this way?

540
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:41,710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

541
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,150
PROFESSOR: Yep, thank you guys.

542
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
So start at the easiest problem.

543
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,030
What do you do if
you have one card?

544
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,220
And then go look at bigger and
bigger and bigger problems,

545
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,680
until we tackle
the hard problems

546
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,360
of what I do with
the entire deck.

547
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:05,020
So when I compute this problem
I'm going to go to iterate how?

548
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,364
From where to where?

549
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:08,792
AUDIENCE: 52 minus i to the 0.

550
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,480
You're actually--

551
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,572
PROFESSOR: So this is i.

552
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,530
AUDIENCE: Oh, that's i.

553
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,700
PROFESSOR: So where
do i go from here?

554
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,025
AUDIENCE: 51 to 0.

555
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:16,900
PROFESSOR: All right.

556
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,930
So now whenever
I access this guy

557
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,356
I know it's already computed.

558
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,730
So the code isn't
going to crash.

559
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,370
OK and this thing is
my topological sort.

560
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,750
So the advantage of
this is that the code

561
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,840
is a lot smaller, right?

562
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,250
Here I'm building the graph.

563
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,760
So I'm calling
some graph methods.

564
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,830
And then I would have to
have the code for computing

565
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,430
the shortest path in a DAG.

566
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,190
And then I would have to
have some code for extracting

567
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,490
the answer using that.

568
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,230
Here this is all the code.

569
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,010
It's a few lines.

570
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,960
And it's because the graph
is represented implicitly.

571
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,550
The topological sort is
represented implicitly.

572
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,770
The edges are
represented implicitly.

573
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,710
So this looks like magic.

574
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,056
But if you know where to
look you'll find the items.

575
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:18,680
You'll find the things that tell
you what the graph looks like.

576
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,958
Yes?

577
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,768
AUDIENCE: So that tells
you how much money

578
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:23,745
you can make, but
does it tell you can--

579
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:24,870
PROFESSOR: How you make it?

580
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,685
Not yet.

581
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:29,380
Parent pointers.

582
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,140
Yeah that's a good point.

583
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,690
Let me see how
we're doing on time.

584
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,460
OK.

585
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,850
I can talk parent pointers.

586
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,150
Am I missing anything else?

587
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,170
There's one decision
that I'm missing,

588
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,500
that I missed here too.

589
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,710
If things look bad
for you, if you

590
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,980
know you're going to lose
money, what can you do?

591
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,900
Walk away.

592
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,620
How much do you get?

593
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,500
AUDIENCE: 0.

594
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,420
PROFESSOR: Yep.

595
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,510
So you always have an
edge that takes you

596
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,400
all the way out with cost 0.

597
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,070
So the way I represent that here
is I start with a choice of 0.

598
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,970
OK now let's do parent pointers.

599
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,040
What's the easiest way
of doing parent pointers?

600
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,625
AUDIENCE: Keep track of
the max of-- [INAUDIBLE].

601
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,560
PROFESSOR: So I want to keep
track-- for every answer here

602
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,257
I want to keep back of the h
that led me to that answer.

603
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,950
So in the dynamic
programming vector,

604
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,010
instead of just storing
the maximum cost,

605
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,600
I'm going to store the maximum
cost and the number of hits

606
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,760
I have to make to get there.

607
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,911
So instead of having one
number here that's 21

608
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,160
I'm going to have two numbers.

609
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,450
I'm going to have
21 and the 1 that

610
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,850
says you have to hit-- sorry,
2-- you have to hit twice.

611
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,060
And then you'll go on this
arrow and so on and so forth.

612
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,630
And if you know
how many hits you

613
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,010
have to make you
can follow this--

614
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,540
you can follow these
parent pointers

615
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,240
and they will tell you how
to play the entire game.

616
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,760
You start at 0 and
play the entire game.

617
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,010
Do we want to change the
pseudocode to do that?

618
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,540
OK, it's not too hard.

619
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,190
How many people want to
see the pseudocode changes?

620
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,580
All right, I guess I don't
have to write it then.

621
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,700
OK any questions on this?

622
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,150
So the change is really simple.

623
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,430
Instead of storing one
number you store a tuple.

624
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,570
And then because
tuples are sorted

625
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,100
the right way
maximum still works.

626
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,724
You don't have to
change that, you just

627
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:56,152
have to change what
you store down there.

628
00:33:56,152 --> 00:34:00,080
AUDIENCE: So you just
add h in, into your--

629
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you add one
more parentheses for the tuple.

630
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,665
Wait, I already have
two, OK, never mind.

631
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:08,165
AUDIENCE: You have to go through
your choices, so you just--

632
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,239
AUDIENCE: Is there any
difference in making

633
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,989
a separate dictionary
for parent pointers?

634
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,420
Does it make any
difference in run time?

635
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,461
PROFESSOR: Absolutely no
difference running time.

636
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:20,544
The code is, it might
be more complicated,

637
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,960
it might be more
simple, depending

638
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,830
on how your brain works.

639
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,352
It's easier to
patch existing code

640
00:34:25,352 --> 00:34:26,810
to add in parent
pointers this way.

641
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,268
If you're writing
new code it might

642
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:32,550
be easier for you to have
a separate dictionary.

643
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,550
This is fewer lines
of code though.

644
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,810
OK any questions on this?

645
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,850
Yes?

646
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,302
AUDIENCE: Could I
generalize and say

647
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:47,760
that if you have
a topological sort

648
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,730
you can do everything backwards.

649
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,417
Otherwise you should
use memoization.

650
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:55,000
PROFESSOR: So actually
you're doing it

651
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,719
in the order of the
topological sort.

652
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,450
You're not doing it backwards.

653
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,720
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK sorry.

654
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,445
If you have a
topological sort then

655
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:03,736
you should do it in that order.

656
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:06,300
But if you don't have
a topological sort

657
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,147
then you should do memoization.

658
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,230
PROFESSOR: If you don't
know the topological sort.

659
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,521
But there has to be one, right?

660
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,970
Because otherwise you
have infinite loops.

661
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,274
If you have an infinite loop
in your dependency graph,

662
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:17,940
then you're not going
to have an answer.

663
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,634
So that means you're
dp formulation is bad.

664
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:23,300
Fortunately for all
the problems that we

665
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,450
have the topological
sort is pretty obvious.

666
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,690
It either grows from 0 to the
problem size or the other way

667
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,890
around.

668
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,810
AUDIENCE: So then
memoization is?

669
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,800
PROFESSOR: So
memoization is, it's

670
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,410
more of a proof
of concept thing.

671
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,360
It shows you that if
you have the recursion,

672
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,501
everything else can
be done automatically.

673
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,750
So like if you build a graph
then you can run top sort

674
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,470
and get the answer, you
don't have to think about it.

675
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,230
We think about it because
the code is smaller

676
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,250
if we do it this way.

677
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,735
If I'd have to
write memoization I

678
00:35:56,735 --> 00:35:58,840
would add 4 or 5
more lines, right?

679
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,920
But the point of doing it
that way is, all you need

680
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,730
is that recursion.

681
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,830
If you have this-- so
this is the magic part.

682
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,460
If you have this, so this line
here of what your choices are

683
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,350
and max, how you combine
them, then everything else

684
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:13,944
is mechanical.

685
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:15,360
Once you've solved
enough problems

686
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,820
everything else is just
follow the process.

687
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,410
So this is the equivalent
of in graph problems,

688
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,410
the hard part is figuring
out what the state is.

689
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,840
Once you know what
the state you know

690
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,040
that these are the
vertices, and you

691
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,540
know how to draw
edges between them.

692
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,560
And then you know
what algorithm to run.

693
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,520
So the hard part is still
knowing what the state is.

694
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,050
Anything else?

695
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,560
So this is dynamic programming.

696
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,510
Smaller code.

697
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,480
This is the graph approach.

698
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,650
They essentially
compute the same thing.

699
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,714
This is more code,
this is less code.

700
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,630
And if you see the
correspondence between them

701
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,996
then you understand the
problem a little bit better.

702
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:04,870
The main point is when
you have a new problem

703
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,030
you can approach it either way.

704
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,279
If you see the dynamic
programming solution right away

705
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:09,610
write it down, you're done.

706
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,980
If not, draw the graph.

707
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,840
Think of what the state
is, draw the edges.

708
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,990
And then after that
you can write the math.

709
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,890
OK let's talk about
a new problem.

710
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,080
Let's talk about the problem
that shows up on interviews.

711
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,550
People excited about interviews?

712
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,340
OK suppose you have a
sequence of numbers,

713
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,760
I'm going to draw
a sequence here.

714
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,560
And you want to
find the shortest

715
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,720
increasing sub-sequence.

716
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,040
So you get to choose some
numbers out of these numbers.

717
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,950
And they have to form
an increasing sequence.

718
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,750
So for example
this is a sequence.

719
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,310
It happens to be increasing.

720
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,790
This is also a sequence,
but it's not increasing.

721
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,170
So it's not a valid answer.

722
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,180
And I want the longest sequence,
the longest sub-sequence

723
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,050
that is increasing.

724
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,920
Does the problem make sense?

725
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,110
How do we solve it?

726
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,200
Do we want to solve it
using dynamic programming

727
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,060
or using graphs?

728
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,120
OK so votes for
dynamic programming.

729
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,740
Votes for graph.

730
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,820
Well too bad, it looks
prettier as a graph.

731
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,660
So how do we solve it as a
dynamic programming problem?

732
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,490
What are the sub-problems?

733
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,060
AUDIENCE: The
largest sub-sequence

734
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,812
PROFESSOR: Starting
somewhere, right?

735
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,060
I'm going to go off
that answer because I

736
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,990
know how to go off of it better.

737
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,180
So say start here.

738
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,940
Say start at 4.

739
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,460
Or actually say I start at 3.

740
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,780
I have two choices.

741
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,520
5, which is closer to me.

742
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,450
And 4.

743
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,951
Well I have a few more choices,
but they're further away.

744
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:43,450
Whatever.

745
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,300
So these are my
choices starting at 3.

746
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,930
If I decide that I'm
going to go from 3 to 4

747
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,410
and the next number
I choose is 4,

748
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,260
now I want the
longest sub-sequence

749
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,180
starting at 4, right?

750
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,060
It still has to be
longest sub-sequence.

751
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,090
So from here on, no matter
what happened before,

752
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:08,550
my behavior still
has to be optimal.

753
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,600
If instead I chose 7, I don't
care what happened before.

754
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,630
The behavior still
has to be optimal.

755
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,551
So a sub-problem says
start at number i.

756
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,510
So starting at number i.

757
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,880
By the way we're going to
use zero-based indexing again

758
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,770
because we like it.

759
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,100
So starting at number
i, what's the longest

760
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,750
increasing
sub-sequence I can get?

761
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,860
So the length of the
blah, blah, blah.

762
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,570
The length of,
you get the point.

763
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,439
OK so I'm going to have
an array again, right?

764
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,480
Which stores the answers.

765
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,570
The array is going
to be named dp.

766
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,580
If I have N numbers I'm going
to have N elements, from 0

767
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,010
to N minus 1.

768
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,470
Suppose I'm at element i.

769
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,940
And suppose this original
array is called a.

770
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,220
I'm in the mood for good
variable names today.

771
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,755
So how do I compute dp if i?

772
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,250
Let's write some
pseudocode for it.

773
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
N minus i--

774
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:48,200
PROFESSOR: So what's h?

775
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:56,520
AUDIENCE: The number of
steps we want to take--

776
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,848
PROFESSOR: So if I'm going
from 3 to 4 h would be what?

777
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:02,348
AUDIENCE: 2.

778
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:03,894
3.

779
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:05,310
PROFESSOR: OK so
I'm going to have

780
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,740
to do additions
and subtractions,

781
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,300
and this is going to confuse me.

782
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,330
So how about I propose this.

783
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,030
What you say is perfectly
valid, but instead, to make sure

784
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,867
I don't make too
many mistakes, I'm

785
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,450
going to look at the
number I land at.

786
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,130
At the index directly.

787
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,000
So I'm going to say I
start at i and end at j.

788
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,590
So the next step is j.

789
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,580
And then your h is j minus i.

790
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,440
So I'm not going to look at the
number of numbers I hop over,

791
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,390
all I care about
is where do I land.

792
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,170
So what's the next number
in the sub-sequence?

793
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,195
If I do it that way,
where do I start?

794
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:47,910
AUDIENCE: i plus 1.

795
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,950
So I can choose the same
number twice, right?

796
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,920
So plus 1 to n.

797
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,194
And then I'm going to have
a choices array here that I

798
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:03,030
start, initialize with nothing.

799
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,270
And then what's the
candidate, if I'm at j?

800
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:16,875
So what answer am I looking at?

801
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:19,850
AUDIENCE: dp of j.

802
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,160
PROFESSOR: OK.

803
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,690
So if I'm at i, and I'm
considering choosing j

804
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,390
as the next element, then my
sequence will be-- my sequence

805
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:33,490
length will be dp of j almost.

806
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,970
Plus 1.

807
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:40,290
OK, can I choose all the--
can I go through all the j's?

808
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:45,670
Can I go from 3 to 2.

809
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,995
AUDIENCE: No.

810
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:52,560
The number at j
is greater than--

811
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,360
PROFESSOR: If the number at j
is greater than the number at i

812
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,730
then I have this new
choice, dp of j plus 1.

813
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,644
What do I do with it?

814
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:07,539
AUDIENCE: Stick it in choices.

815
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:08,830
PROFESSOR: Stick it in choices.

816
00:44:13,196 --> 00:44:14,070
Sorry this is append.

817
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,370
And afterwards?

818
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,470
And by the way, this
thing is under the if.

819
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:25,963
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

820
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,650
PROFESSOR: OK and I'm
missing one choice this way.

821
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,070
What's my default choice?

822
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:50,176
So what's the sequence
length if I just stay there?

823
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:51,565
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

824
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,850
PROFESSOR: So if I decide to
not choose anything after 3

825
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,900
then I have a number, 1.

826
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,880
Small detail, again
one of those things

827
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,510
that costs you one point
if you get it wrong.

828
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,840
OK so I have a default.

829
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
So I know that this is
going to be well-defined,

830
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,470
and I have all my
possible choices.

831
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,440
Yes?

832
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,720
AUDIENCE: dp of j
representing a [INAUDIBLE].

833
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,410
PROFESSOR: So it's
saying, if I'm at i,

834
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,100
and the next number
in the sequence

835
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,460
is j, what's the longest
sub-sequence-- the length

836
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,090
of the longest
sub-sequence starting at j?

837
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,260
So let's run the dp for
this example actually.

838
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,350
Let's get a feel for why
it works and how it works.

839
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,660
So I'm going to
copy it again here.

840
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,850
8, 3, 5, 2, 4, 9, 7, 11.

841
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,100
So this is a.

842
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,440
And dp is here.

843
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,130
Where do I start by the way?

844
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

845
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,500
PROFESSOR: So I have
the algorithm here,

846
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,360
how do I iterate?

847
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,242
For i in--

848
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:15,186
AUDIENCE: N minus N is 0.

849
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:18,260
PROFESSOR: N minus
1 all the way to 0.

850
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,164
So in this case we're going
to start at 11, right?

851
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,810
The default choice is 1.

852
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,180
Do I have any other choice?

853
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,180
Can I go forward?

854
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,630
Nope.

855
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,740
So this is going to be 1.

856
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:38,840
Now for 7 my array of
choices has a default of 1.

857
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,360
And then for-- let me
write the indices too,

858
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,160
so I don't get confused.

859
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,210
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

860
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,960
And these are i's.

861
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,900
So we're at 7, i equals 6.

862
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,880
For j equals 7, is a of
j greater than a of i?

863
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,610
OK.

864
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:09,890
So then 7, 11 is a
possible choice, right?

865
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,670
So if I choose 11 as the
next point in my sequence,

866
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,390
what's the total
sequence length?

867
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,400
2.

868
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,130
And 1 plus dp of 7 equals 2.

869
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,880
So this is good.

870
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,980
So far the answers add up.

871
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,420
So I have 1 and 2
as my candidates

872
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,210
for the answer 2dp of 6.

873
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,880
What's the maximum?

874
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,480
All right.

875
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,800
Works so far.

876
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,610
How about 9?

877
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,960
What are the possible
answers for 9?

878
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,160
So what's choices?

879
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,520
First there's 1,
there's always 1.

880
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,540
And then for j equals
6, will the if be true?

881
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,210
No.

882
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,020
I can't add a 7
after a 9, right?

883
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,700
So go to the next one.

884
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,094
For j equals 7,
will the if be true?

885
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:03,510
So this append
will happen, right?

886
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,430
What will be appended
in the array?

887
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,940
And this means that if I'm at
9, and then the next element is

888
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,930
11, the longest sequence
I can get has length 2.

889
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,860
OK, what's the answer for 9?

890
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,340
So if I start at 9 the
longest sequence I can make

891
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,260
has length 2.

892
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,170
Let's look at 4 now.

893
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

894
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,930
PROFESSOR: What is?

895
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,900
AUDIENCE: Just in general
that's-- the problem is defined

896
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,170
as, OK in this case
you go from 9 to 11.

897
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,944
Or do you have to go from
9 to the next element?

898
00:48:49,944 --> 00:48:51,860
PROFESSOR: So this is
the longest sub-sequence

899
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,340
if I do-- so the longest
sub-sequence I get overall.

900
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,960
I don't have to go
to the next element.

901
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,810
So if my problem looks like
this, what is the best answer?

902
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,440
AUDIENCE: It's
almost defined as--

903
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,940
PROFESSOR: So the
problem is defined

904
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,730
as, this is your first
element in the sub-sequence.

905
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,154
What's the best
answer you can get?

906
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,070
AUDIENCE: I thought in
that case it would be 1

907
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,236
because there's nothing
following it that's greater.

908
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:18,750
PROFESSOR: This
is greater, right?

909
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,950
AUDIENCE: Unless it skips.

910
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,600
PROFESSOR: So it's a
sub-sequence, not a sub-string,

911
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,390
which means it can skip.

912
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,260
I hope I got these right.

913
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,220
So you can skip,
otherwise the answer

914
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,370
would be a bit
easier to compute.

915
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,380
OK how about 4?

916
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,850
So let's start with 1
because that's the easy one.

917
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,359
And then?

918
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,724
AUDIENCE: 1, 3, 3, 2, right?

919
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,390
Because it's going
to be 3 for that one.

920
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,104
PROFESSOR: OK.

921
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:54,520
AUDIENCE: And then
3 for this one.

922
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,850
PROFESSOR: 3 for this one.

923
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,660
AUDIENCE: And then 2.

924
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,370
PROFESSOR: So all these
are bigger, so all of them

925
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,740
are possible next candidates.

926
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,560
And these are the
sequence lengths

927
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,470
that I can get if I choose them.

928
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,755
Final answer?

929
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:09,030
AUDIENCE: 3.

930
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,646
PROFESSOR: 3 maximum.

931
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:13,170
AUDIENCE: But for setting
the parent pointers

932
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,330
you'd want to take the
closest thing, right?

933
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,577
PROFESSOR: As long as it's
a maximum I don't care.

934
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,140
So what are possible
parent pointers here?

935
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,460
The 2's, right?

936
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,910
So either this or this.

937
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,932
Do I care which one I chose?

938
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:31,652
AUDIENCE: No, I guess I don't.

939
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:33,110
PROFESSOR: As long
as I choose a 2.

940
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,650
From a 3 I know I
have to go to a 2.

941
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,280
I can't go to 1
because otherwise it

942
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,450
wouldn't be as long as possible.

943
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,850
And then from 2's
I have to go to 1,

944
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,700
and I don't care which one.

945
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,800
OK how about 2, what's dp of 2?

946
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,250
Does everyone else see it?

947
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,310
So these are all
possible choices

948
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:59,490
because they're
all bigger than 2.

949
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:04,750
And I get 1 if I don't
choose anything, 4, 3, 3, 2.

950
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,727
So 4 is the biggest answer.

951
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:10,060
Let's look at this one, this
one's a bit interesting, 5.

952
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,360
So what are the choices here?

953
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,115
1 if I don't look
at anything else.

954
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:14,615
Then?

955
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,030
There's a 3, 4, then 9.

956
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:24,860
A 3, 4, then 7.

957
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,710
And?

958
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,970
And a 2 for the 11.

959
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,240
So this if is going to skip
these two elements, which

960
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,770
I can't use to make an
increasing sub-sequence.

961
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,590
And then it's going
to look at these ones,

962
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:41,290
and it's going to add
1 to the numbers here.

963
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:41,850
And I get 3.

964
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,540
OK.

965
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,031
What is the answer for 3?

966
00:51:48,031 --> 00:51:50,404
AUDIENCE: 4.

967
00:51:50,404 --> 00:51:52,070
PROFESSOR: And what
is the answer for 8?

968
00:51:56,038 --> 00:51:58,520
AUDIENCE: 3.

969
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,700
PROFESSOR: Right, the
choices are 9 and 11.

970
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,940
Starting with itself
and then 9 and 11.

971
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,040
So now what's the longest--
what's the answer overall

972
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,840
for this problem?

973
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,330
So it's not dp of 0, right?

974
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:15,980
Before when I had
blackjack I knew

975
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,420
that I have to start
at the first card.

976
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,780
So the answer was dp of 0.

977
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,720
In this case it's not
dp 0, it's the maximum

978
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,290
of all the dp's here.

979
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:29,111
Because I can start my
sequence anywhere I want.

980
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:30,360
So I have to take the maximum.

981
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,800
And that's the overall answer,
which in this case is 4.

982
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,220
OK does it make sense now?

983
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,910
Somewhat?

984
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,950
So if you don't
understand please look

985
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,130
at how you'd represent
this as a graph.

986
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,260
The idea is that the
numbers are nodes

987
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,460
and you draw an edge
between numbers,

988
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,110
where the first number is
smaller than the second number.

989
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,500
Write that formulation, write
the shortest path for that,

990
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,310
and see how that
matches to this.
