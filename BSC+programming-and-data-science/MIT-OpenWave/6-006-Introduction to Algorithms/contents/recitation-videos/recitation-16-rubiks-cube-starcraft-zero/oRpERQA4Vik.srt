8
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:21,490
PROFESSOR: OK.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,020
So who's going lecture?

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,290
Good.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,905
Does everything makes sense?

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,252
AUDIENCE: Mostly.

13
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,710
PROFESSOR: That's good, because
we're going to do problems.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,460
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,240
PROFESSOR: So, what I want
to talk about is, first,

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,750
there's a subtlety in the
Rubik's cube problem, which I'm

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,462
guessing nobody has seen yet,
but we're going to talk about

18
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,920
it anyway, because otherwise
you'll trip on it while you're

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,340
doing the problem.

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,780
And then we're going to
talk about one or maybe two

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,380
problems.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,474
And I'm excited about
the problem titled,

23
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:53,140
"there's StarCraft
and counter strikes,"

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,050
so, let's hope we get to them.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,600
AUDIENCE: I'm curious, did you
write this week's problem set?

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,630
Because there's some
Chinese in there.

27
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,260
PROFESSOR: No.

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,968
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

29
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:06,580
PROFESSOR: No,
someone else wrote it.

30
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,675
I suggested putting
that in there, though.

31
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:13,857
AUDIENCE: You had an
awesome internship, right?

32
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:14,811
[INAUDIBLE]

33
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,767
AUDIENCE: Wait, did you make all
the AMD [INAUDIBLE] questions?

34
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:18,600
PROFESSOR:Of course.

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,266
That's my stuff.

36
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:23,030
OK.

37
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,280
So Rubik's cubes.

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,319
Did everyone see a 2
by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube?

39
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,860
You guys are going
to lecture, right?

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,700
You have one.

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,240
Yeah.

42
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,210
Did you guys see Eric's
2 by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube?

43
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,960
It looks sort of like this.

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,230
All right, so big
Rubik's cube has how many

45
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,319
small cubelets in it?

46
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:53,860
AUDIENCE: 80.

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,820
AUDIENCE: 80.

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,270
AUDIENCE: I like cubelets
better than cubies.

49
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,687
Cubies is hard to say.

50
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
would say cubicles.

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,260
So let's go for--
let's try cubelets

52
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,410
and see how this works.

53
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,410
OK.

54
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,750
So each cubelet has six
faces, but three faces

55
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,460
are always facing inwards.

56
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,960
They're always attached
to the center of the cube.

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,810
So we don't care about them.

58
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,760
We only care about
the other three faces.

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,060
So if you have a
plastic Rubik's cube.

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,360
Say this is a plastic--
This is a plastic cube.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,870
Then you're going to have
eight plastic cubelets.

62
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,722
Each cubelet has
three colored faces

63
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,430
and three faces that
we don't care about.

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,020
So how many total plastic
faces in a cubelet, sorry,

65
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,728
plastic cube?

66
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,144
AUDIENCE: Twenty-four.
[INAUDIBLE]

67
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:51,850
PROFESSOR: All right.

68
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,010
Now let's play with
an imaginary cube.

69
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,224
And I call this
a wireframe cube,

70
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,390
because I draw it like this.

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,460
So, here pretend you have the
skeleton of a Rubik's cube,

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,510
made out of wires or out
of wood or something.

73
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,130
So it's basically a small sheet
of wood, small piece of wood,

74
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,200
small sheet of wood,
so on and so forth.

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,310
And so this doesn't
have any colors in it,

76
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,700
but it's the right shape
and sort of the right look.

77
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,440
So the way you would build
the configuration is,

78
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,050
you take 24 plastic faces that
you get from a plastic cube,

79
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,590
and you paste them one
by one onto the faces

80
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,430
of a wireframe cube.

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,200
And they claim that this
can build any configuration

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,570
that you can think about.

83
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,110
If you look at a cube, after
no matter how many moves

84
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,750
you've done to it,
it's going to have

85
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,420
some-- it's going to have
the faces somewhere, right?

86
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,275
So you can take the
faces and face them

87
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,250
where they belong
and there you go.

88
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,560
You have a real cube
built out of a wireframe

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,570
and plastic faces.

90
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,630
How many wireframe
faces there are?

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,864
Please don't get this wrong.

92
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:22,780
AUDIENCE: Twenty-four.

93
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,107
PROFESSOR: OK.

94
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,732
AUDIENCE: There are
some configurations

95
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,807
that aren't possible, right?

96
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:29,390
PROFESSOR: OK.

97
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,400
There are some configurations
that aren't possible,

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,590
and that is very good news.

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,640
We'll get to that later.

100
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,060
Let's see how the code
talks about these faces.

101
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,720
So suppose we have a cubelet
that has these faces.

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,740
Front faces yellow, this face is
blue, and this face is orange.

103
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,580
This facing code is called--
so this yellow face here

104
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,520
is called y o b.

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,972
So y is yellow, that's
the yellow face,

106
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,110
and is the yellow
facing the cubelet that

107
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,880
has a yellow face, an orange
face, and a blue face.

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,010
Fortunately, there
aren't two cubelets

109
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,180
that have the same face
color, so this is good enough

110
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,599
to distinguish
between all of them.

111
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,390
Let's see if you guys
are paying attention.

112
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,330
How would I call this face?

113
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:33,340
AUDIENCE: o y b?

114
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:38,580
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

115
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,670
Either that or o b y, whichever
one the code happens to use.

116
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,810
So the principal is,
these are the colors

117
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,960
and the first one is the
face that you're pointing at.

118
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,310
So there are 24
plastic faces, so there

119
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,960
are 24 names for
these plastic faces.

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,825
Let's see how we name
the wireframe faces.

121
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,570
If I take this face-- so
we don't have colors here,

122
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,450
they're all the same.

123
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,550
So instead we care
about their position.

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,650
A cube has a front
and a back, right?

125
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,770
This cubelet is on the
front somewhere, right?

126
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,660
So I'm going to have front
somewhere in the name.

127
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,610
It has an upper face
and a lower face.

128
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,034
Is this going to
be upper or lower?

129
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,990
AUDIENCE: Upper.

130
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,816
PROFESSOR: And
the left or right?

131
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:37,524
PROFESSOR: Right.

132
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,570
PROFESSOR: OK.

133
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,702
So front upper right,
which face am I looking at?

134
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:47,777
AUDIENCE: The front.

135
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:48,360
PROFESSOR: OK.

136
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,630
f u r, fur.

137
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,440
How about this space?

138
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:00,440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

139
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,604
PROFESSOR: So far so good?

140
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,490
Or it could be r u f, right?

141
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,908
PROFESSOR: Or it could be r u f.

142
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:11,824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

143
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,322
PROFESSOR: I really don't know
what it means, I'm behind.

144
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:21,405
AUDIENCE: Ruff like a dog?

145
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:22,830
It has fur.

146
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,100
PROFESSOR: Oh, ruff ruff ruff.

147
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,600
OK.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,500
That's not too bad.

149
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,833
I was afraid of something worse.

150
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,970
OK.

151
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,270
That's cool.

152
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,860
So a configuration
will take plastic faces

153
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,890
and face them onto
the wireframe faces.

154
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,730
So a configuration is going
to be an array of 24 elements.

155
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,660
And the first element is going
to tell me which plastic face

156
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,270
ends up in-- Let's say if
you are the second one,

157
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:03,607
says which plastic
face ends up in r u f,

158
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,210
and the third one, let's
assume it's the space.

159
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:10,035
AUDIENCE: Ruff.

160
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:10,701
PROFESSOR: Ruff.

161
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,120
And there are 21
more faces, right?

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,960
So each face has
a number from zero

163
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,990
to 23, because we're in Python,
so we like zero-based indexing.

164
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,050
And 24 elements in the
array, 24 plastic faces.

165
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,799
Which plastic face
goes into f u r?

166
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,970
Assuming this cubelet here--
see, I said cubicle anyway.

167
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,945
This cubelet here goes here
in exactly this configuration.

168
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,576
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

169
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:49,770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

170
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,110
So this face ends up here.

171
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,630
And that's what it means that
the first element in the array

172
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,420
is y o b.

173
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,416
How about r u f?

174
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,290
Who ends up in r u f?

175
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:05,646
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

176
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,312
AUDIENCE: B o y.

177
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,314
PROFESSOR: And who
ends up in e r f?

178
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:15,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

179
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:19,930
PROFESSOR: OK.

180
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,680
So does everyone
understand configurations?

181
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,422
Does this make sense?

182
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:25,047
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

183
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,544
I got lost somewhere in there.

184
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:30,037
Can you explain the order
for f u r and [INAUDIBLE]?

185
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,727
Like front upright?

186
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:32,310
PROFESSOR: Oh.

187
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,907
So do you mean-- so the
order of the letters.

188
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,240
So there are two orderings here.

189
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,500
One is the order of the
letters and there is an order.

190
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,570
I think the code
uses clockwise order,

191
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,970
but what really matters is the
first letter tells you which

192
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,404
face you're talking about.

193
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,020
AUDIENCE: So this is front face.

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,758
PROFESSOR: Face, up face.

195
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:51,666
AUDIENCE: What's up?

196
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,940
What's front?

197
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,480
PROFESSOR: So for this
cubelet, this is front,

198
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,730
this is the right, this is up.

199
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:11,230
This cubelet wold have a
front, an up, and a left.

200
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,580
So now there are
24 faces and all

201
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,370
of them get numbers from 0 23.

202
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,400
And here we assume that
f u r is space zero,

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
r u f is space 1, and
e r f is face 2, which

204
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,830
is not quite [INAUDIBLE], but
you'll have the mapping there.

205
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,330
OK.

206
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,610
So a configuration is in
an array of 24 elements

207
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,450
and it maps plastic faces
to wireframe faces, which

208
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,530
brings us to, how many
configurations are there?

209
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,847
AUDIENCE: You mean like
mapping 4 factorial?

210
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:46,430
PROFESSOR: OK.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,280
So let's see what it does.

212
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,625
We have 24 plastic faces.

213
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,550
From 0 to 23.

214
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,832
And they have to be
mapped to 24 positions.

215
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,082
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

216
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:15,525
AUDIENCE: There's six
colors, aren't there?

217
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

218
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,022
PROFESSOR: There are six colors,
but if this is also yellow,

219
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:21,980
but there's a red here.

220
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,160
This is a different face,
see, this is yellow,

221
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,230
red, and there's
a green down here.

222
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,960
Then this is the yellow face of
the yellow, green, red cubelet.

223
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,800
So we care about the
individual faces.

224
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,141
So yeah, your answer was right.

225
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,890
I'm trying to explain
it to everyone else.

226
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,158
But your answer is right.

227
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:37,033
AUDIENCE: Well, wait.

228
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:40,485
But you can't-- I mean, we
talk about some are impossible.

229
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,540
Like, you're always gonna
have a grouping of y o b.

230
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,352
That's never gonna change.

231
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:46,060
PROFESSOR: Right.

232
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,870
So some of these
aren't reachable,

233
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,870
because you're not allowed
to break up the cube.

234
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

235
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,709
PROFESSOR: And that's OK.

236
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,500
This is still how the
code represents them.

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,655
So I'm asking if you had-- if
all these would be possible,

238
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,880
how many would we get?

239
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,470
And the answer is that
to map 24 plastic faces

240
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,050
to 24 wireframe faces.

241
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:13,120
So this mapping is called--
anyone good with math?

242
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,460
AUDIENCE: 1 to 1.

243
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,560
AUDIENCE: Bijection.

244
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,450
PROFESSOR: OK.

245
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:22,320
So when you're taking-- OK.

246
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,190
So when we have two sets and you
have a bijection between them

247
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,270
or 1 to 1 mapping, that
function is also called?

248
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

249
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,353
PROFESSOR: You probably
don't know the answer yet.

250
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,900
You have to wait
until the end of 6042.

251
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,300
So I'm trying to hint that
right now, if you remember

252
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,264
the end of 6042, maybe the
answer is somewhere there.

253
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:44,930
AUDIENCE: Blur?.

254
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,770
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

255
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,919
AUDIENCE: A perfect match

256
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,710
AUDIENCE: Permut--.

257
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:59,820
AUDIENCE: I totally learned
about that in middle school,

258
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,000
I think.

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,276
PROFESSOR: OK.

260
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:03,775
So this is--

261
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,590
AUDIENCE: Permutations
and combinations.

262
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,240
PROFESSOR: So this
is a permutation.

263
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,095
PROFESSOR: How many permutations
do you have out of 24 elements?

265
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,183
AUDIENCE: Does that order
[? mean ?] [? matters ?]

266
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,155
[INAUDIBLE] 24 [INAUDIBLE].

267
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,577
PROFESSOR: So this is a
lot of permutations, right?

268
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,160
It's a good thing
that we're not going

269
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,830
to explore most of
these configurations.

270
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,980
So we said before,
that we're going

271
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,490
to build a graph where the
vertices are configurations,

272
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,180
and the edges are
moves that get us

273
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,460
from one configuration
to another configuration.

274
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,920
Can they afford to build
this graph first and then run

275
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,850
BFS on it?

276
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,190
Not going to work, right?

277
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,410
We don't have
enough RAM for this.

278
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,220
So instead we're going
to have to operate

279
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,580
on an implicit graph
for presentation.

280
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,340
Well, fortunately, BFS
doesn't want the whole graph.

281
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,620
The way BFS works is
it has a list of nodes

282
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,980
that it has to visit, and
when it visits a node,

283
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,170
it wants to know its neighbors.

284
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,280
And that's it.

285
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,400
Yes?

286
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,290
Everyone happy with it?

287
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,040
So all they have
to do is, in order

288
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,030
to build this implicit
graph representation,

289
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,200
is we have to know
the start node,

290
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,670
So BFS can start somewhere.

291
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,190
And we have to be able
to give it a node,

292
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,860
we have to be able to generate
all the neighbor nodes.

293
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,360
So given the
configuration, we have

294
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,276
to be able to generate
the configurations that

295
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:33,950
would result by applying
most of that configuration.

296
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,810
So what are the moves
that you can do with this?

297
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,440
Suppose you have a cubelet.

298
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,020
What are the possible moves?

299
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,030
There aren't that many.

300
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,840
We're interested in the
simplest kind of moves.

301
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,766
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

302
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:49,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
can make the right side

303
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,760
go right, which is equivalent
to the left side going left.

304
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
And then you can do [INAUDIBLE]
4, left [INAUDIBLE].

305
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,260
AUDIENCE: It's a nice number.

306
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,240
PROFESSOR: OK.

307
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,610
I think there are a few more,
so here's how I look at it.

308
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,460
You can take the front
face, so these four,

309
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,430
and do a clockwise
rotation, 90 degrees,

310
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,260
or you can do a counterclockwise
rotation, 90 degrees.

311
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,830
And you can do
that for each face.

312
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,470
AUDIENCE: But doing a front
clockwise rotation is the same

313
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,499
as doing a back counter
clockwise rotation, which

314
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,727
is [? it-- ?]

315
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

316
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,170
PROFESSOR: Doing
a front clockwise,

317
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,400
doing a back counterclockwise
is the same thing

318
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,990
after you account
for symmetries.

319
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,490
Yeah.

320
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,080
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

321
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,330
AUDIENCE: So it's six?

322
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:36,520
PROFESSOR: Yep.

323
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,728
So there's only six after
you account for symmetries.

324
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,330
Let's play devil's
advocate and assume

325
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,620
we don't account for symmetries.

326
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,286
We're actually doing
the code, because I

327
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,610
need to teach you something.

328
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,616
So let's assume we don't apply.

329
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:48,990
By the way, how
would you account

330
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,110
for symmetries, easy way?

331
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,990
Did anyone read the
comments in the code?

332
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:58,590
OK.

333
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,125
So would you account
for symmetries.

334
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,610
AUDIENCE: Doesn't
it just happen?

335
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,850
The permutation is
going to [INAUDIBLE].

336
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,266
AUDIENCE: Can you
just look at it,

337
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:18,430
like, each space is neighboring
faces, and [INAUDIBLE]?

338
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,580
PROFESSOR: So the way we do
it is we anchor one cubelet.

339
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,870
So we have one cubelet that
is a plastic cubelet that

340
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,910
is always going to go here.

341
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,320
So three plastic
faces here are always

342
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,339
going to go to three
wireframed faces here.

343
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:40,880
And if you fix those
three faces then

344
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,690
you don't have simple
symmetries anymore.

345
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,500
All right?

346
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,684
Three axes of symmetry, so
fixing three faces settles it.

347
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:52,940
AUDIENCE: Wait, so then how
many moves are possible?

348
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,430
12?

349
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,090
AUDIENCE: No.

350
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,960
But you only do
one thing, though.

351
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,980
Now you don't do
counterclock-- you don't do.

352
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,190
AUDIENCE: If one is
anchored, there's six left.

353
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

354
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,370
Yeah.

355
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,703
You don't move the anchored one.

356
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,550
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, because
you can only [INAUDIBLE] two

357
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,256
of the-- three of
the faces now, but.

358
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:11,839
PROFESSOR: OK.

359
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,390
So let's look at the left face.

360
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,660
So you have a configuration.

361
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,210
So you can move the
left face clockwise,

362
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,760
left face counterclockwise.

363
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,910
You can move the top
face clockwise, top face

364
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,680
counterclockwise,
and a couple more.

365
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,610
So what does a move look like?

366
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,670
Someone said it before.

367
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,550
So when you're doing a move,
what's going to happen is,

368
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,652
a move doesn't
create plastic faces

369
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,110
and it doesn't
destroy them, right?

370
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,580
It just changes their
position on the wireframe.

371
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,150
So if you have an initial
configuration that

372
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,560
has plastic faces assigned
to wireframe faces,

373
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,340
and you have a
final configuration,

374
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,882
these plastic faces are
going to end up somewhere

375
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:10,590
on the wireframe.

376
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,130
And that's true for
all the plastic faces.

377
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,270
So the plastic faces are
going to end up somewhere.

378
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,930
Also, what's nice is if
we look at the wireframe,

379
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,940
if I do a clockwise rotation
in the front, whatever

380
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,440
plastic face was here
is going to end up here.

381
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,520
Whatever plastic face was
here is going to end up here,

382
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,374
so on and so forth.

383
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:41,658
So it's a function of rotation
[INAUDIBLE] inside [INAUDIBLE].

384
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:45,693
Like the four faces that
correspond to each other,

385
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:46,540
rotate.

386
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,930
PROFESSOR: OK.

387
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,010
That's some good-- that's
going deeper than want to go.

388
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,530
I want to account for
something simpler.

389
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,120
So my point is that
the arrows will always,

390
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,030
if I do a right
clockwise rotation,

391
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,880
the arrows will
always look the same.

392
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,200
So the only thing that changes
is what's inside the array.

393
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,670
But if you take one
configuration array

394
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,750
and you move things
according to the way you're

395
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,390
supposed to move them for
the front clockwise move,

396
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,712
you're going to get
the right result.

397
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,420
So what is this a
bunch of arrows called?

398
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,510
What does it do?

399
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,750
What does it do to the faces?

400
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,286
What does it do to the
elements of the array?

401
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,120
AUDIENCE: It moves
in different spots.

402
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,982
PROFESSOR: OK, so
fancy math name?

403
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:34,280
AUDIENCE: Shuffle.

404
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,762
PROFESSOR: OK.

405
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:36,970
So this is what I got before.

406
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,428
This is how you
think of it, right?

407
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:42,404
It's a shuffle, so fancy
math name for a shuttle.

408
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:43,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

409
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,105
PROFESSOR: All right.

410
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,850
AUDIENCE: Something
going on here.

411
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,338
PROFESSOR: So then a move is a?

412
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,838
AUDIENCE: Rotation
[? permutation?].

413
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:55,254
[INAUDIBLE]

414
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,410
PROFESSOR: All right, so the
thing is-- the difficult part

415
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,190
of the code is you
have two things that

416
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,320
are represented by permutations.

417
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,030
Configurations are
permutations of plastic faces

418
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,540
onto the array, onto the
array of wireframes faces.

419
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,145
And then a move is a
permutation of a configuration

420
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,270
into another configuration.

421
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,420
OK, so now if I want
to compute neighbors,

422
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,730
I take-- we think
there are six moves,

423
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,520
so I'm going to take six moves.

424
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,950
I'm going to type out the
permutations, so 6 times

425
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,800
24 numbers, and that's it.

426
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,921
Now I can compute neighbors.

427
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:40,795
Does that make sense?

428
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,942
AUDIENCE: I think you
have all the permutations.

429
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,650
PROFESSOR: So there
are six moves, right?

430
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,063
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
then it's right.

431
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:48,780
Oh yeah--

432
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,720
PROFESSOR: If I take
a configuration,

433
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,009
and I apply the
permutation for this move,

434
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:56,550
I'm going to get a
new configuration,

435
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,960
and that's its neighbor.

436
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,600
So if I apply the
permutation for LC 4,

437
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,780
left clockwise to
this configuration,

438
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,950
I get the new configuration.

439
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,790
So all I need to do is hard
code those configurations,

440
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,540
and then I'm done.

441
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,350
I can compute neighbors.

442
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,560
But that's a lot of typing.

443
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,480
I don't want to type as much.

444
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,170
I want to reduce my
burden a little bit.

445
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,830
And we can do that by noticing
that some moves are associated

446
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,460
with some other moves.

447
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,357
So, if I go left
clockwise move, that's

448
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:30,190
the inverse of a left
counterclockwise move.

449
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,220
So, if given the permutation,
I could compute its inverse,

450
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,634
then I wouldn't have to
type as many permutations.

451
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,599
Right?

452
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,640
Why do I care about that?

453
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,121
Did anyone take 6004?

454
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:46,620
Remember?

455
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,570
So at some lab, which
is the dreaded beta lab,

456
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,657
you have to write the control
block for a processor, right?

457
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:54,990
And that's a lot of zeros and
1's that you have to type.

458
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,858
And if you get one wrong,
good luck to [INAUDIBLE].

459
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,810
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

460
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,437
AUDIENCE: 18 wide and 64 tall.

461
00:22:03,437 --> 00:22:04,411
PROFESSOR: I know.

462
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:05,872
AUDIENCE: Copy and paste like.

463
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:06,846
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and copy paste.

464
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:07,346
[INAUDIBLE]

465
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:11,229
PROFESSOR: OK.

466
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,690
Bad memory.

467
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,166
Let's move on.

468
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,980
Let's move on.

469
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,920
So two good news, two
pieces of good news.

470
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,629
One, some of these are
redundant in our case, two,

471
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:23,170
we wrote everything for you, so
you don't have to write them,

472
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,741
we're just teaching
you how we did them,

473
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:29,030
because the inverse of
a permutation is cool

474
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,054
and I think it's a
good concept to know.

475
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:32,720
So let's look at how
a permutation looks

476
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,820
like and compute its
inverse and then move on

477
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,040
to other nice problems.

478
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,540
OK so let's take a
presentation of five elements,

479
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,500
not going to go to
24 on the board here.

480
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,190
3, 5, 1, 2, 4.

481
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,940
This is how permutations
look like in math mode.

482
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,520
If you want to be
more explicit, you

483
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,730
can add a row numbers above.

484
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,860
And this is a bit more explicit
about what a permutation does.

485
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,010
So permutation takes an input
list, let's say a b c d e.

486
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,850
And for this is an output list,
according to the recipe that

487
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,790
you see here .

488
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,110
So this pretty much says, the
first element of the output

489
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,060
is the third element
of the input.

490
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,850
The second element of the
output is the fifth element

491
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,655
in the input.

492
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,380
Wait, this is the
wrong permutation.

493
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:42,715
It doesn't look as pretty, so
I'm changing the permutation.

494
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,970
The third element of the
output is the first element

495
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,790
in the input.

496
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:56,290
The fourth element of the
output is which letter?

497
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,291
So which letter?

498
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,060
AUDIENCE: Oh. [INAUDIBLE]

499
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,215
PROFESSOR: And the fifth element
of the output is which letter?

500
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:10,740
AUDIENCE: Did you mean
to get c instead of a?

501
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,240
No.

502
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,264
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

503
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,930
That would make more
sense, wouldn't it?

504
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,800
Thank you.

505
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,300
OK.

506
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,840
So if this is
permutation pi, then this

507
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,560
is the effect of applying
pi to this original list.

508
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,980
Now the inverse of a
permutation by minus 1

509
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,870
is another bunch of arrows,
and what I want to do

510
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,344
is, if I take this, which
is the output of pi,

511
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,760
and I run it through
these arrows,

512
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,810
I want to get back a b c d e.

513
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,830
So I want to undo
the effect of pi.

514
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,330
OK.

515
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,700
How do I compute this inverse?

516
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,620
How do I compute pi
minus 1 given pi?

517
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,760
AUDIENCE: Wait, you're
giving us the initial,

518
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,640
when we start with c d a e b?

519
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,140
PROFESSOR: You only
start with this.

520
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,220
This doesn't matter at all.

521
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,340
A different list would
get different results.

522
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,920
So this is the permutation,
and I want pi to the minus 1.

523
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,890
AUDIENCE: So you take the value.

524
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,150
So you have 3 4 1 5 2.

525
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,920
So the value at index
1 you put that index,

526
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:35,390
that index has a value
of index 3, et cetera.

527
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,580
AUDIENCE: So c would
go to position 1?

528
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,822
AUDIENCE: Wait.

529
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,042
PROFESSOR: OK.

530
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,750
AUDIENCE: Is it true
that you can run pi,

531
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:49,030
so the number of times it will
eventually equal pi inverse?

532
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,272
PROFESSOR: Yes, but
that's complicated algebra

533
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:53,117
to prove that.

534
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,200
AUDIENCE: Not forget that.

535
00:25:57,092 --> 00:26:00,650
Just like make that
[INAUDIBLE] thing that you made

536
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,130
and sort of flip it.

537
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,000
PROFESSOR: OK.

538
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,640
I like that.

539
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,349
So 34152, 1 2 3 4 5.

540
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:13,890
Except this doesn't
look very pretty,

541
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,389
so I need to sort
them again, right?

542
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:22,350
So 1 3, 2 5, 3 1, 4 2, 5 4.

543
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:25,370
Right?

544
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,080
Did you guys come
up with it now?

545
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,990
Congrats.

546
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,740
So this is good.

547
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,198
This is how you
compute an inverse.

548
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:34,640
Let's figure out why you
compute an inverse that way.

549
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,200
Let's look at b.

550
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,730
So b starts out at
position 2, right?

551
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:52,030
And then pi of 5 equals 2, which
means that, after applying 5,

552
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,500
b is going to go to position 5.

553
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,220
So pi inverse has to
take b and put it where?

554
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,060
Back to 2, right?

555
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,160
Otherwise it's not
a good inverse.

556
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,860
So pi inverse of 2.

557
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,410
So the second
element in the output

558
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,374
has to be which
element in the input?

559
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,160
5, right?

560
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,840
Otherwise, this wouldn't
undo the effect of pi.

561
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,140
So if you write out our
permutation and split

562
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,587
the index and the value, we
get the inverse permutation.

563
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:34,170
So you can compute that with a
couple of lines of Python code.

564
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,270
OK.

565
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,240
So this lets us now compute
some of the permutations there.

566
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,460
So we only have to type
up two, three, four,

567
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,892
or something like that.

568
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:46,350
It's a bit nicer
and you guys don't

569
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,680
have to type up any,
because we gave them to you.

570
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,200
Aren't we nice?

571
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,700
All right.

572
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,783
Any questions about
permutations or Rubik's cubes?

573
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,620
AUDIENCE: Wait, so
to get high inverse

574
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,312
based off those numbers,
you just-- well,

575
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:03,910
it's the same thing.

576
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,320
Wait, but 5 got flipped.

577
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,430
Or you think the maybe if the
inverse of that matrix then?

578
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,260
PROFESSOR: So you take these
two and you flip them, right?

579
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

580
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,530
PROFESSOR: And then you keep
these bound, but you sort them.

581
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,477
2 5, 3 1, 4, no-- 3 5 1 2 4.

582
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:30,518
AUDIENCE: Oh they're still
based off the top row?

583
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:31,277
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

584
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:31,985
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

585
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,077
AUDIENCE: Wait, how did
he get the second one?

586
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:35,410
AUDIENCE: Based off the top row.

587
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,090
PROFESSOR: So you sort this
one, but you keep the bonds,

588
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,780
so 3 ends up here and it
gives it 1, 4 ends up here

589
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,600
and it gives us 2.

590
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,360
OK.

591
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,370
So this make sense?

592
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,870
Good.

593
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,590
We're remembering
that, that's good.

594
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,890
Now let's talk about a problem.

595
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,890
So this is a Rubik's cube,
this is how it works.

596
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,750
Hopefully we will remember
how to solve game.

597
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:05,130
Let's try to solve
StarCraft Well,

598
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,526
of course we're going to cheat.

599
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:08,650
We're going to solve a
simpler version of StarCraft

600
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,210
because it turns out you
can't really solve StarCraft

601
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,950
with the computers
that we have now.

602
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,470
So let's make a few
simplifying assumptions.

603
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,980
Who play StarCraft, by the way?

604
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,580
Two?

605
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,080
OK.

606
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,817
So you guys, please
pay attention

607
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,650
to the simplifying
assumptions, because this

608
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,990
isn't real StarCraft.

609
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,830
It's a lot easier, so that we
can build a problem out of it.

610
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,330
All right.

611
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:38,070
So we're going to play
with a race called Zerg.

612
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:44,230
And so the idea of StarCraft
is you build an army

613
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,820
and then you take
this army and you

614
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,140
destroy your opponent,
nice and simple.

615
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,860
Good old violent games.

616
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,240
So we're going to look at the
build order part of the game.

617
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,840
So the build order is the
opening strategy and it takes

618
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,830
care of the building process,
so it's the strategy that says,

619
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,820
what are you going
to build and when,

620
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,760
in order to come up with an
army as quickly as possible?

621
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,970
So the main goal is to amass
an army quickly and then take

622
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,732
that army and
destroy the opponent.

623
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,440
And yes, I know, not
real life StarCraft,

624
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,780
but let's go with it.

625
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,660
OK, so these are the
rules in our toy StarCraft

626
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,690
And the Zerg is started with a
building called the hatchery.

627
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,810
And out of a hatchery--
the currency of the game,

628
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,170
by the way, is minerals.

629
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,510
We'll write that
down as dollars.

630
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,040
So out of a hatchery
you can build a drone

631
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,400
by spending 50 minerals.

632
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,760
You can build an
overlord by spending 100,

633
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,970
or you can build a
Zergling by spending 50.

634
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,940
All right, what do
each of these do?

635
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,180
A drone harvests minerals
for you, so it's a worker.

636
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,050
So, for every drone
that you have,

637
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,500
you get eight minerals a second.

638
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,100
So drone gets you eight
minerals a second.

639
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,060
As Zergling is your
attack unit, so this

640
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,130
is the guy that you want
to build in the end.

641
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,600
So this destroys your opponents.

642
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,020
I don't know how to make a
nice icon for that, so big

643
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,540
smiley green.

644
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,260
This makes it happy.

645
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,850
All right.

646
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,680
Overlords help you
control your units,

647
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,830
so drones and
Zerglings are units.

648
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,670
You can't build-- for every
eight units that you build,

649
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,330
you have to have an overlord.

650
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,960
Otherwise, you can't
build more units

651
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,710
until you build overlords.

652
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,000
So if you have eight drones,
you can't build a ninth on one

653
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,950
you build an overlord.

654
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,300
If you have eight drones
and these eight Zerglings,

655
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,020
you have to build
a second overlord

656
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,840
to be able to build more units.

657
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,225
So one overlord can help
you control eight units.

658
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,900
In order to build
a Zergling, which

659
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,316
is what you want
to do in the end,

660
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:57,930
because these are the attack
units, you need to spend $50,

661
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,280
and you also need to
have one building called

662
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,090
a spawning pool.

663
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,250
You what?

664
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,800
All right.

665
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,960
So how do you build
that spawning pool?

666
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,390
Drones can work for
you, but they can also

667
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,080
transform into buildings.

668
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,749
So a drone mutates into a
building, and after it mutates,

669
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:19,040
it doesn't work for you
anymore, by the way, so no more

670
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,500
minerals.

671
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:28,230
So a drone can mutate into the
spawning pool for 200 minerals,

672
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,230
I think.

673
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,740
It can mutate into a hatchery.

674
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,590
That's the same thing
that you have up here for,

675
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,230
how much is it?

676
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,340
$450.

677
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,590
And it can mutate into
an evolution chamber

678
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:51,030
that we'll talk
about soon, for $400.

679
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,530
OK.

680
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,360
Why do we care about having
more than one hatchery?

681
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,650
One hatchery can build one unit
per second, no more than that.

682
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,480
So once you have a lot
of drones and you're

683
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,220
making a lot of money, you need
to have a lot of hatcheries

684
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,180
so that you can spend the money.

685
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,670
Our goal is not to amass money,
it's to build units, right?

686
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,004
So money doesn't
help you, I'm going

687
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:12,337
to spend it as fast as possible.

688
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,300
OK.

689
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,126
An evolution chamber
lets you build-- let's

690
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:20,850
you upgrade research
to technologies.

691
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,600
And these technologies
aren't like badges.

692
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,420
Once you get them,
you keep them.

693
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,630
So you can research
an attack upgrade

694
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,560
and you can research
a defense upgrade.

695
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,030
They're both 1,000 minerals,
but you only have to do it once.

696
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,040
Why do I care about these?

697
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,340
They decide how strong
your Zerglings are.

698
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,870
So, given a Zergling, at
the beginning of the game,

699
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,670
you don't have the
attack upgrade,

700
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,760
and you don't have
a defense upgrade.

701
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,150
So the Zerglings attack is 1.

702
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,360
If you research
the attack upgrade,

703
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,580
but you haven't researched
the defense one,

704
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,530
their total power is 133.

705
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,010
If you research the defense
upgrade, but not the attack

706
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,670
upgrade, their
total power is 1.2.

707
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,750
And after your research both of
them, their total power is 2.

708
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,730
Again, oversimplifying.

709
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,480
So, we have to build an army
that's as powerful as possible.

710
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,370
So in the end you want to
have both of these researched.

711
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,870
All right.

712
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,080
Now there's one more
limitation, that is,

713
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,280
you cannot control more than
200 of these units total,

714
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,130
because even if you
have a lot of overlords,

715
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:33,100
your brain isn't immensely huge,
so you can only control 200

716
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,199
units.

717
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,489
So we want to build these 200
units as fast as possible.

718
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,699
And out of these
200 units, we want

719
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,330
to have at least 150 Zerglings.

720
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,794
If you build 200
drones, you're not

721
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:52,460
going to attack your
opponent with that,

722
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,650
those aren't very useful.

723
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,650
But you need some drones
in order to make money,

724
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,280
so you need the balance.

725
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,170
So the goal is to get to 200
units as quickly as possible,

726
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,532
and at least 150 Zergs.

727
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,960
Yes?

728
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,560
Evolution chamber.

729
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,811
Easy, that's too much.

730
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,310
OK.

731
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,624
So how do we solve this?

732
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

733
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,830
PROFESSOR: So how
do we solve this?

734
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,064
AUDIENCE: Watch the pros play.

735
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:31,480
PROFESSOR: Well, they're going
to play real StarCraft this

736
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,622
is toy StarCraft this is
six-level 6 StarCraft so it's

737
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:37,320
not going to work.

738
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,030
But there is a simple
strategy, because I

739
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,688
haven't added one
last constraint.

740
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:44,700
AUDIENCE: Lets me guess.

741
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,310
PROFESSOR: No.

742
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,340
It's going to be
harassing your enemy.

743
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,590
But if you don't have to
harass your enemy intuitively

744
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,100
and build your economy
first, so first

745
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,950
build your drones
and hatcheries,

746
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,222
and then pop out
Zerglings, right?

747
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,430
So there's a greedy strategy.

748
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,450
If you spend about an hour
with a sheet of paper,

749
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,074
you can realize what
is the right order

750
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:05,510
to build drones and
hatcheries and overlords,

751
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,680
so that you get to a nice
big economy, and then, Bam!

752
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,944
Build Zerglings.

753
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:13,110
Once you get to 50 drones,
you start build Zerglings

754
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,130
as fast as possible.

755
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,540
So this is a greedy
strategy, you

756
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,250
don't need to do a
lot of work for that.

757
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,041
So we want to make
things more interesting.

758
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,450
So in order to make
things more interesting,

759
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,780
the game time goes in seconds.

760
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,820
Everything that we had
here is in seconds.

761
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:36,865
Every two minutes, so two
minutes, which is 120 seconds.

762
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,490
So every two minutes
I want to assemble

763
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,570
a small pack of
Zerglings and send them

764
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,160
to the enemy to harass them.

765
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,140
And the Antonio enemy
will defend themselves

766
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,690
and they will
destroy my Zerglings,

767
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,360
but they won't be able to
focus on the game very well.

768
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,320
So I need to do this in order
to have a good chance to win.

769
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,290
If I don't do this, my
strategy is invalid.

770
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,070
AUDIENCE: Does the enemy,
does it do that to us as well?

771
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,119
PROFESSOR: No.

772
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,160
We're sending them facts.

773
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,230
We are going to have a really
fast strategy, because we're

774
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,450
computing the optimal
strategy, so they're not

775
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,410
going to have time.

776
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,840
They're going to
be fighting us off.

777
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,330
OK, how many
Zerglings do I send?

778
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,170
I have to send enough
Zerglings so that the attack

779
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:19,198
power at minutes 2m is
6 times log 1 plus m.

780
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,031
You knew there has to
be some mapping there.

781
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,080
So the reason for this is, let's
look at the first two minutes.

782
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,050
After two minutes, if we
haven't researched any upgrades,

783
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,500
we need to send this
in six Zerglings.

784
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,800
If we researched both
upgrades, we only

785
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,379
need to send in three Zerglings.

786
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:38,920
If we researched
one of the upgrades,

787
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,240
we need to send
in five Zerglings.

788
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,911
So this is the
total attack power,

789
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:45,160
not the numbers are of
Zerglings that we need to send.

790
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,630
AUDIENCE: And is minutes?

791
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,110
PROFESSOR: Actually,
it's basically

792
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,810
which attack wave you're
doing, so every two minutes.

793
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,600
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

794
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,060
So the first one
is m equals zero.

795
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,064
PROFESSOR: And 1.

796
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:07,230
That is not the one attacking
right in the beginning

797
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,764
when we don't have Zerglings.

798
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:09,680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

799
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,310
PROFESSOR: Equals 1, n equals 2,
n equals 3, so on and so forth.

800
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,935
AUDIENCE: How did
you get that formula?

801
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,176
OK.

802
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:19,800
PROFESSOR: Is it
making your life hard?

803
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,233
Would that be logged base
2, or is that log base 10?

804
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,399
PROFESSOR: Sure, log base 2.

805
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:31,704
Fine.

806
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,440
OK, so how are we
going to solve this?

807
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,460
Intuitively, how did
we solve all the game

808
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,660
problems, all the
problems recently?

809
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,000
What are we going to do?

810
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

811
00:38:47,982 --> 00:38:49,440
PROFESSOR: So the
first thing we're

812
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,993
going to build a graph, right?

813
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:51,880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

814
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,046
PROFESSOR: So build a graph.

815
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,240
The vertices are the
states of the game,

816
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,700
so a vertex shows
me what state I'm in

817
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,930
and an edge shows
possible moves that I do.

818
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,792
So what I need to keep track
in the vertex, what's my state?

819
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,648
AUDIENCE: How much money
you have, and how many units

820
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:14,552
you have?

821
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,932
And maybe how fast
you're making money?

822
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:18,870
AUDIENCE: Oh, unless
the states, are

823
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,274
states-- they're not movable?

824
00:39:21,274 --> 00:39:23,440
Oh, I guess they could be
moveable [INAUDIBLE] could

825
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,252
do nothing, in the
next second, right?

826
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:27,710
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
you need to keep track of time,

827
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,475
too?

828
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:29,840
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

829
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,100
PROFESSOR: OK so maybe time.

830
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,668
What else?

831
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:37,120
AUDIENCE: Badge
[INAUDIBLE] thing.

832
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,116
PROFESSOR: OK so upgrades.

833
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:43,895
You said units, I'm
going to say buildings.

834
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,190
AUDIENCE: Wait, is
Zergling is a building?

835
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,100
PROFESSOR: A Zergling
is a unit, so-

836
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,530
AUDIENCE: Overlords.

837
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,590
PROFESSOR: Unit, unit, unit.

838
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,510
Building, building,
building, upgrade, upgrade.

839
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,232
So let's see how are we
going to keep track of them.

840
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:05,065
That's a good point.

841
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:08,870
We started looking at units,
we started looking at units.

842
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,850
So how do I keep
track of my units?

843
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,179
What I need to know?

844
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:18,110
AUDIENCE: The number of
drones, overlords, servlings.

845
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,740
PROFESSOR: Droids, drones,
overlords, Zerglings.

846
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,240
OK.

847
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,073
How about buildings?

848
00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:27,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PHEC--

849
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,179
PROFESSOR: Almost.

850
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,970
So I want to know the
number of hatcheries,

851
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,280
because this is how
fast I can produce.

852
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,681
But then how many spawning
pools am I going to build?

853
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:38,180
Good.

854
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,930
So that was StarCraft player 1.

855
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,300
Once you have a spawning
pool, you can build Zerglings,

856
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,260
there's no reason to
build more than one.

857
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,417
So a spawning pool is
going to be like a badge.

858
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:48,250
Once you build it, you
have it, you're done.

859
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,976
So it's Boolean.

860
00:40:49,976 --> 00:40:51,900
AUDIENCE: Wait, what's
a spawning pool again?

861
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,280
PROFESSOR: So a spawning
pool is something

862
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
that you build off a drone
and once you have it,

863
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,940
you can build Zerglings
from a hatchery.

864
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,987
So that's all it does.

865
00:40:58,987 --> 00:41:00,612
AUDIENCE: Why would
you want two if you

866
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,735
can build four Zerglings?

867
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:05,110
PROFESSOR: So the spawning
pool doesn't build a Zergling.

868
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,560
See, the hatchery
builds the Zerglings.

869
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,019
So the spawning
pool is just there.

870
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:10,601
You need to have it
to cross the edge.

871
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,456
Otherwise you can't.

872
00:41:11,456 --> 00:41:11,997
AUDIENCE: OK.

873
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,303
I understand.

874
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:13,886
PROFESSOR: OK.

875
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,720
So what else for buildings?

876
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,220
Whether you have
it or not, right?

877
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,830
OK.

878
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,172
How about upgrades?

879
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:28,900
[INAUDIBLE] a u, d u.

880
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,060
PROFESSOR: So two
flags, a u, d u.

881
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,560
Cool.

882
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,540
So now we have the thorny
issues of money and time.

883
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,460
Let's say that we're going to
have some sort of approximation

884
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,390
that's going to allow us
to not keep track of money,

885
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,290
because money is-- you
can have a lot of money,

886
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,057
so that will give us
an explosion of states.

887
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:52,140
So we're going to assume
that we're spending money

888
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,130
as fast as possible,
because that's

889
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,054
what you usually want to do.

890
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:59,040
AUDIENCE: So should your
money always be zero then?

891
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,486
PROFESSOR: Almost.

892
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:01,920
It's very close to that.

893
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,840
So you start off with no money.

894
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,310
You accumulate
money, then you're

895
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,230
going to issue some build
orders and build something.

896
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,210
And your money's
going to drop, maybe

897
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,470
to zero, maybe to almost zero.

898
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,770
Then you wait to
accumulate more money,

899
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,630
issue another build order.

900
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,660
Wait to accumulate more money,
hopefully it goes faster now.

901
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,456
Issue another build order.

902
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:26,330
We're going to approximate
that every time we

903
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,890
issue a build order,
so every time we

904
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,350
tell our things to
build something,

905
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,420
the money will drop to zero.

906
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,470
So that doesn't mean you
can only build one thing

907
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,120
and then your money
drops to zero.

908
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,550
If you wait for a few
seconds and then you

909
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,390
have two hatcheries and tell
both of them to build drones,

910
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,640
you build two drones and
then your money goes to zero.

911
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,909
So that means that if we
model our states carefully,

912
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,450
we don't have to
keep track of money.

913
00:42:56,722 --> 00:42:58,763
AUDIENCE: You should
probably keep track of time.

914
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:04,000
AUDIENCE: Actually
keep track of the rate

915
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,470
you're gathering though, right?

916
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,750
PROFESSOR: So what's the
rate that you're gathering?

917
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,055
AUDIENCE: It's the number of--

918
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,440
AUDIENCE: Oh [INAUDIBLE]
drones, yeah. [INAUDIBLE], OK.

919
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,721
PROFESSOR: So this
multiplied by 8%.

920
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,947
AUDIENCE: So we should
keep track of time.

921
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:20,530
PROFESSOR: OK.

922
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,441
So how would we solve it
if we keep track of time?

923
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,449
AUDIENCE: You multiply

924
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,282
AUDIENCE: Can you do
that layer thing again?

925
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:31,190
Where is that?

926
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,766
PROFESSOR: So you're going
to have-- so what's a layer?

927
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:36,057
AUDIENCE: Actually, never mind.

928
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,240
AUDIENCE: I want to
know what a layer is.

929
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,968
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

930
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:43,676
AUDIENCE: I want to
know what a layer is.

931
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:47,000
PROFESSOR: So last time we-- we
solved problems by saying that,

932
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,680
so we had the graph of streets.

933
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,000
We had a highway graph.

934
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,820
And that was a 2D graph.

935
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,190
And we made it into a
3D graph by adding time

936
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,260
as a third dimension.

937
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,570
So we had layers,
where each layer was,

938
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,310
said that you're at
a point in the graph

939
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,780
at a certain point in time.

940
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,769
So there's a layer 4
times 0, layer 4 time 1,

941
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:06,560
so on and so forth.

942
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,250
And you start at time 0 and
kept going up the graph.

943
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,300
AUDIENCE: You have
a flag that says,

944
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,180
I've just purchased something?

945
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,600
Because that way then you'll
know that you've completely

946
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,420
exhausted your-- that
maybe that will tell you

947
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,502
that you can't buy
anything for awhile, right?

948
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:27,562
Because if we're not
keeping track of money then

949
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:28,700
we should know [INAUDIBLE].

950
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,283
PROFESSOR: OK.

951
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:31,200
So that's a good point.

952
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,280
So if I have-- so suppose here
I have to wait for five seconds

953
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,060
to get enough
money to do a move.

954
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,880
If I keep track of
time in my state and I

955
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,431
have five things here.

956
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:43,180
I also have to keep
track of money, right?

957
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,929
I have to know how
much money I'm getting,

958
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:46,600
so that I know where
I'm buying things.

959
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,020
On the other hand,
in this case, if I

960
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,620
keep track of both time
and money as states,

961
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,190
I can implement a
precise strategy.

962
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,523
I don't need this approximation.

963
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,610
If I do that, then what
search algorithm would I use?

964
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:05,930
So if I have time in states,
so each vertex in my note

965
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,490
says that I get from some
states to some other state

966
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:12,200
in one unit of time.

967
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,975
What algorithm do I use
to search for my strategy?

968
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,600
Yeah.

969
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,659
Why do I use BFS?

970
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:23,700
AUDIENCE: Because every
edge has the same weight.

971
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,450
PROFESSOR: Every edge has
the same weight, right?

972
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,040
So if we keep
track of time, then

973
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,970
we-- we keep track of time,
we keep track of money,

974
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,592
we use BFS, we have a solution.

975
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:33,092
So.

976
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,680
Let's try to not do
it, either of these.

977
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,290
If I don't want to
keep track of time

978
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,640
and I don't want to
keep track of money,

979
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,360
what would an edge be?

980
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,880
If I want to say that, hey, this
is a state and this is a state.

981
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,879
What should be the
edge connecting them.

982
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:01,420
AUDIENCE: What other
item you got is.

983
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,170
AUDIENCE: Is that
after a second?

984
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,930
PROFESSOR: So the
distance between these

985
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,550
won't be a second, right?

986
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,130
If I have to wait
for five seconds to

987
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,670
accumulate enough to
issue this build order

988
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,825
that would get me
the state then--

989
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:15,325
AUDIENCE: The time
you have to wait?

990
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,221
PROFESSOR: So that's what
I would put on an edge.

991
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:22,220
So this way I don't have
to keep track of money,

992
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,678
I don't have to
keep track of time.

993
00:46:23,678 --> 00:46:25,130
So the graph is smaller.

994
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,350
So I can look into
bigger graphs.

995
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,700
If I do this, what
algorithm do I use?

996
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,404
To find my strategy?

997
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:34,320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

998
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

999
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,100
PROFESSOR: So no time, no money.

1000
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,670
And [? extra ?].

1001
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,010
So this looks
reasonably easy, right?

1002
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,280
I mean, if you want to get
from one state to another,

1003
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,890
you see what you'd
have to build,

1004
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,870
you see how much
it costs, and you

1005
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,910
see how much you have to wait
to accumulate those resources.

1006
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,435
Except there's one glitch.

1007
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,990
How do we deal with this?

1008
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,880
How do we make sure that we do
our attacks on time and how do

1009
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,518
we know that we're-- how
do we keep track of them?

1010
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:12,881
AUDIENCE: What is this
again representing?

1011
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:14,880
PROFESSOR: So this is
that every two minutes you

1012
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,930
have to have a
number of Zerglings

1013
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,039
that you're sending
to attack the enemy.

1014
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,080
And the number of Zerglings
that you need to have

1015
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,670
depends on the time and
it depends on the upgrades

1016
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,220
that you got.

1017
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,140
So how do we keep track of this?

1018
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,650
AUDIENCE: If the edges
are a function of time,

1019
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:46,853
then just know that at radius
120-- at radius 120 over 5,

1020
00:47:46,853 --> 00:47:50,610
then you'd have to
send more Zerglings.

1021
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:55,110
PROFESSOR: So what if not all
the edges have the same weight.

1022
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,840
So let's look at how a graph
looks like for a little bit.

1023
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,810
So we're going to
have an initial state,

1024
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:06,710
say one hatchery and six
drones and one overlord.

1025
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:11,016
And we want to
build a new drone.

1026
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,390
Say we want to
build a new drone.

1027
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,060
A drone costs 50 minerals.

1028
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,730
We have six drones.

1029
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,890
Each drone gets us
eight minerals a second,

1030
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,510
so in one second we're
going to get 48 minerals.

1031
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,180
So bummer, we have to wait for
two seconds to build one drone.

1032
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,660
And now we're going to be in
the state of one hatchery, seven

1033
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,830
drones, one overlord.

1034
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:45,900
If you said we want to
build a hatchery-- then

1035
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,260
we're going to need to
accumulate 400 or 450.

1036
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:56,340
Oh, we have to accumulate 450,
using six drones, 48 minerals,

1037
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,222
so I guess nine seconds.

1038
00:48:58,222 --> 00:49:00,180
So we're going to have
to wait for nine seconds

1039
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,070
to get that money.

1040
00:49:03,772 --> 00:49:05,230
And then when we
build, we're going

1041
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,240
to spend the drone
building, because it's

1042
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,500
going to turn into a hatchery.

1043
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,330
And then we're going to end
up with two hatcheries, five

1044
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,820
drones, and one overlord.

1045
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,030
So edges have different weights.

1046
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,937
So I can't look at the radius
in terms of number of his edges.

1047
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,770
AUDIENCE: Everything
builds instantaneously.

1048
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,696
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.

1049
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,070
AUDIENCE: You could keep track
of just the total distance

1050
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,370
from whatever starting
build you are?

1051
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,250
AUDIENCE: Actually,
if the distance

1052
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,980
from the origin to where
you're at is a multiple of 120,

1053
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,820
then you should
have another state

1054
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,288
that you have to [INAUDIBLE].

1055
00:49:42,288 --> 00:49:46,240
AUDIENCE: Assuming you have any
drones left, hopefully you do.

1056
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,654
PROFESSOR: So that's modeling.

1057
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:50,570
One way of doing it is
sure, model every round

1058
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,190
of the attack as one,
every round of harassment

1059
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,460
is one there in the graph,
and we can do it that way.

1060
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,760
Is that what you're saying?

1061
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,562
So you can't-- once
you're at 120 seconds,

1062
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:04,020
you have to do an attack and
then you get to the next layer

1063
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,320
in the graph.

1064
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,900
AUDIENCE: That makes
a lot of sense.

1065
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,900
AUDIENCE: Of course that's
what we were thinking.

1066
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,524
PROFESSOR: How about
let's not do that.

1067
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:11,790
How about let's represent
it without layers?

1068
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,610
So that's good.

1069
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,193
You're getting closer
to the solution.

1070
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:16,620
It is much better than
representing every time.

1071
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,926
Write the number of
layers this time over 120,

1072
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:20,720
it's a huge improvement.

1073
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,070
Well, we can do it
without any-- we can do it

1074
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:27,384
without any time
notion whatsoever.

1075
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:29,050
Let's see, can I let
you think about it?

1076
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,135
Oh, I can let you think
about it for 30 seconds.

1077
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,377
So there's a key
insight here that--

1078
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:39,960
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

1079
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,256
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1080
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:44,740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] but if
you figure how much time has

1081
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,050
elapsed, based on
the items we have

1082
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,766
and our starting state, right?

1083
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:50,140
Because if we have
two hatcheries

1084
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,625
and we started
with one hatchery,

1085
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,730
we know that at least
nine seconds has elapsed.

1086
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,190
PROFESSOR: Well, so I like the
first part of what you said,

1087
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,350
the second part is
too complicated.

1088
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,740
But we can know
what time we're at.

1089
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,190
Why?

1090
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,350
AUDIENCE: Because it takes
a certain amount of time

1091
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:09,241
to achieve everything,
each thing.

1092
00:51:09,241 --> 00:51:11,366
AUDIENCE: Are we assuming
that we take the shortest

1093
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:14,931
path to get to each
state that we're at?

1094
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:16,430
PROFESSOR: So we're
using the extra.

1095
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,510
How does the extra work?

1096
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,630
You have a queue,
a priority queue.

1097
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,140
You extract a node, you
look at the neighbors.

1098
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,650
When you extract
the node, do you

1099
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,557
know the distance to that node?

1100
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:31,640
AUDIENCE: Can you explain?

1101
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,110
You ask?

1102
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,045
PROFESSOR: I'm asking.

1103
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,220
AUDIENCE: I know, but like
the node asks and says,

1104
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,074
how far away are you?

1105
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:41,490
PROFESSOR: So you need to keep
that in the priority queue.

1106
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,100
So the extra--
the main invariant

1107
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,330
is that once you
pull out the node,

1108
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,467
you're not going to find any
shorter path to that node.

1109
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:51,050
So you already know
the shortest path.

1110
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,860
That how you sort the nodes
in the priority queue.

1111
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,920
So when we're at
a configuration--

1112
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,330
Say we're at some
configuration here,

1113
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:07,090
two hatches, six drones,
and five Zerglings.

1114
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:11,780
We already know that, say
we're at time 119 seconds.

1115
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,940
If what I want to do next
is build another hatchery,

1116
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,836
then I have to wait, what, six
drones, same thing as before.

1117
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:20,460
I have to wait for
nine seconds, right?

1118
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,850
So the edge would
look like this.

1119
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,270
And then we're going to get
to three hatcheries, five

1120
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,480
drones, five Zerglings.

1121
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,200
This crosses a one, this crosses
a two-minute boundary, right?

1122
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,810
So when I cross
this boundary, I'd

1123
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,980
better have enough
Zerglings to do an attack.

1124
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,660
Do I have enough
Zerglings to do an attack?

1125
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,520
No.

1126
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,920
So is this a valid move?

1127
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,610
Is this the valid
edge in our graph?

1128
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,480
It's not.

1129
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,700
So when you're at a node,
you already know the time

1130
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,120
that you need to
get to that node,

1131
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,070
so when you generate
the neighbors,

1132
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,630
you can check for
each edge to see

1133
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,149
it crosses that 120 second game.

1134
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:05,190
Now let's assume it does.

1135
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,564
Let's see how this
works and this

1136
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:08,350
is the last thing we're doing.

1137
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:12,260
So suppose you have two
hatcheries, six drones,

1138
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,390
and eight Zerglings.

1139
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:18,380
And you're going to
build that same hatchery.

1140
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,990
So you're going to go
past this 120 second mark.

1141
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,635
What state are you
going to end up in?

1142
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,707
How many hatcheries?

1143
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:29,960
AUDIENCE: Three.

1144
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,140
PROFESSOR: OK.

1145
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,330
How many drones.

1146
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,585
AUDIENCE: Five.

1147
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,834
PROFESSOR: How many Zerglings.

1148
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:37,618
AUDIENCE: Two.

1149
00:53:37,618 --> 00:53:39,010
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1150
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,950
So key elements, two
Zerglings, because this edge

1151
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,200
crosses the 120-second
harassment boundary,

1152
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,800
so you have to send
in six Zerglings

1153
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,370
and you're going to lose them.

1154
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,580
So we're taking advantage of
how the extra works to sort

1155
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,620
of generate our
edges on the fly.

1156
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,390
So we wouldn't be able
to regenerate this graph,

1157
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,610
even if we wanted to have to.

1158
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,610
We have to work with the
implicit representation

1159
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,610
and, as we learn the
distances to the nodes,

1160
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,990
the minimum distances,
we also learned the edges

1161
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,165
that we have coming
out of those nodes.

1162
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,540
AUDIENCE: So it's kinda of
like this graph that's growing

1163
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,373
and we're like as it
gets to a certain point

1164
00:54:14,373 --> 00:54:17,340
we kill a bunch of paths
and then it keeps on going.

1165
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,459
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1166
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:20,500
Doesn't this makes sense?

1167
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,420
So the good news is
that this is like we're

1168
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,310
training you to run
a 10-mile marathon,

1169
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,230
so you can run 50
meters for the test.

1170
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,730
Let's still try to
get it, because I

1171
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,880
think it's a cool problem.
