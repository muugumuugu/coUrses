8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,390
PROFESSOR: Hi.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm Srini Devadas.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,040
I'm a professor of electrical
engineering and computer

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,650
science.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,970
I'm going to be co-lecturing
6.006-- Introduction

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,950
to Algorithms-- this term
with professor Erik Domane.

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,001
Eric, say hi.

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:36,883
ERIK DOMANE: Hi.

16
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:38,650
[LAUGHTER]

17
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,210
PROFESSOR: And we
hope you're going

18
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,710
to have a fun time
in 6.006 learning

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,760
a variety of algorithms.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,760
What I want to do today is
spend literally a minute or so

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,004
on administrative
details, maybe even less.

22
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:56,420
What I'd like to
do is to tell you

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,670
to go to the website that's
listed up there and read it.

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,250
And you'll get all
information you

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,430
need about what this class
is about from a standpoint

26
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,590
of syllabus; what's expected
of you; the problem set

27
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,660
schedule; the quiz schedule;
and so on and so forth.

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,460
I want to dive right in and tell
you about interesting things,

29
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,550
like algorithms and
complexity of algorithms.

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,490
I want to spend
some time giving you

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,380
an overview of the
course content.

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,640
And then we're
going to dive right

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,230
in and look at a
particular problem of peak

34
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,360
finding-- both the one
dimensional version and a two

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,900
dimensional version-- and
talk about algorithms to solve

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,670
this peak finding problem--
both varieties of it.

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,000
And you'll find
that there's really

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,090
a difference between
these various algorithms

39
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,480
that we'll look at in
terms of their complexity.

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,070
And what I mean
by that is you're

41
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,750
going to have different run
times of these algorithms

42
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,210
depending on input
size, based on how

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,600
efficient these algorithms are.

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,370
And a prerequisite for
this class is 6.042.

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,620
And in 6.042 you learned
about asymptotic complexity.

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,240
And you'll see that
in this lecture

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,430
we'll analyze relatively
simple algorithms today

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,070
in terms of their
asymptotic complexity.

49
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,340
And you'll be able
to compare and say

50
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,940
that this algorithm is fasten
this other one-- assuming

51
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,320
that you have large
inputs-- because it's

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,840
asymptotically less complex.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,185
So let's dive right in
and talk about the class.

54
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,550
So the one sentence
summary of this class

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,910
is that this is about
efficient procedures

56
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,850
for solving problems
on large inputs.

57
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,800
And when I say large
inputs, I mean things

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,720
like the US highway
system, a map

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,110
of all of the highways
in the United States;

60
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,850
the human genome, which
has a billion letters

61
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,170
in its alphabet; a social
network responding to Facebook,

62
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,840
that I guess has 500
million nodes or so.

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
So these are large inputs.

64
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,470
Now our definition of large has
really changed with the times.

65
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,440
And so really the 21st
century definition of large

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,971
is, I guess, a trillion.

67
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:37,470
Right?

68
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,680
Back when I was your age
large was like 1,000.

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,400
[LAUGHTER]

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,844
I guess I'm dating myself here.

71
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:46,760
Back when Eric was your
age, it was a million.

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,260
Right?

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,650
[LAUGHTER]

74
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,000
But what's happening really
the world is moving faster,

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,420
things are getting bigger.

76
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,880
We have the capability of
computing on large inputs,

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,220
but that doesn't
mean that efficiency

78
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,760
isn't of paramount concern.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,690
The fact of matter is
that you can, maybe,

80
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,550
scan a billion elements
in a matter of seconds.

81
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,750
But if you had an algorithm
that required cubic complexity,

82
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,899
suddenly you're not talking
about 10 raised to 9,

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,079
you're talking about
10 raised to 27.

84
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,510
And even current
computers can't really

85
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,890
handle those kinds of numbers,
so efficiency is a concern.

86
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,820
And as inputs get larger, it
becomes more of a concern.

87
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,320
All right?

88
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,398
So we're concerned about--

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:51,310
--efficient procedures-- for
solving large scale problems

90
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,940
in this class.

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,640
And we're concerned
about scalability,

92
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,030
because-- just as,
you know, 1,000

93
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,600
was a big number a
couple of decades ago,

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,140
and now it's kind of
a small number-- it's

95
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,430
quite possible that by the
time you guys are professors

96
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,220
teaching this class
in some university

97
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,690
that a trillion is going
to be a small number.

98
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,430
And we're going to be talking
about-- I don't know--

99
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,520
10 raised to 18
as being something

100
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,620
that we're concerned with from
a standpoint of a common case

101
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,510
input for an algorithm.

102
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,120
So scalability is important.

103
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,480
And we want to be able to track
how our algorithms are going

104
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
to do as inputs get
larger and larger.

105
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,180
You going to learn a bunch
of different data structures.

106
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,650
We'll call them classic
data structures,

107
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,450
like binary search
trees, hash tables-- that

108
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,020
are called dictionaries
in Python-- and data

109
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,470
structures-- such as balanced
binary search trees-- that

110
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,975
are more efficient than just
the regular binary search trees.

111
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,350
And these are all
data structures

112
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,540
that were invented
many decades ago.

113
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,850
But they've stood
the test of time,

114
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,530
and they continue to be useful.

115
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,210
We're going to augment these
data structures in various ways

116
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,330
to make them more efficient
for certain kinds of problems.

117
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,980
And while you're not going to be
doing a whole lot of algorithm

118
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,180
design in this
class, you will be

119
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,335
doing some design and a
whole lot of analysis.

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,060
The class following this
one, 6.046 Designing Analysis

121
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,530
of Algorithms, is
a class that you

122
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,080
should take if
you like this one.

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,180
And you can do a whole lot more
design of algorithms in 6.046.

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,880
But you will look at
classic data structures

125
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,260
and classical algorithms
for these data structures,

126
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,470
including things like sorting
and matching, and so on.

127
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,200
And one of the nice
things about this class

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,800
is that you'll be doing real
implementations of these data

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,130
structures and
algorithms in Python.

130
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,880
And in particular are
each of the problem

131
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,680
sets in this class are
going to have both a theory

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,930
part to them, and a
programming part to them.

133
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,430
So hopefully it'll
all tie together.

134
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,060
The kinds of things we're going
to be talking about in lectures

135
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,200
and recitations are going
to be directly connected

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,260
to the theory parts
of the problem sets.

137
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,800
And you'll be programming the
algorithms that we talk about

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
in lecture, or augmenting
them, running them.

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,180
Figuring out whether they work
well on large inputs or not.

140
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,530
So let me talk a little
bit about the modules

141
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,462
in this class and
the problem sets.

142
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,920
And we hope that
these problem sets

143
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,470
are going to be fun for you.

144
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,430
And by fun I don't mean easy.

145
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,656
I mean challenging and
worthwhile, so at the end of it

146
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:24,280
you feel like you've
learned something,

147
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,870
and you had some
fun along the way.

148
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,580
All right?

149
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,550
So content wise--

150
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,830
--we have eight
modules in the class.

151
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,490
Each of which,
roughly speaking, has

152
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,020
a problem set
associated with it.

153
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,950
The first of these is what
we call algorithmic thinking.

154
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,130
And we'll kick start
that one today.

155
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,480
We'll look at a particular
problem, as I mentioned,

156
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,790
of peak finding.

157
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,350
And as part of
this, you're going

158
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,960
to have a problem set that's
going to go out today as well.

159
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,320
And you'll find that
in this problem set

160
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,420
some of these algorithms
I talk about today will

161
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,090
be coded in Python and given to.

162
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,190
A couple of them are going
to have bugs in them.

163
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,340
You'll have to analyze the
complexity of these algorithms;

164
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,380
figure out which ones are
correct and efficient;

165
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,760
and write a proof
for one of them.

166
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,260
All right?

167
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,320
So that's sort of an
example problem set.

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,600
And you can expect that
most of the problem sets

169
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,036
are going to follow
that sort of template.

170
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:40,750
All right.

171
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,810
So you'll get a
better sense of this

172
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,690
by the end of the
day today for sure.

173
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,930
Or a concrete sense
of this, because we'll

174
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,850
be done with lecture and you'll
see your first problem set.

175
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,540
We're going to be doing a
module on sorting and trees.

176
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,619
Sorting you now about,
sorting a bunch of numbers.

177
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,160
Imagine if you had
a trillion numbers

178
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,250
and you wanted to sort them.

179
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,610
What kind of algorithm
could use for that?

180
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,280
Trees are a wonderful
data structure.

181
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,760
There's different varieties, the
most common being binary trees.

182
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,580
And there's ways of doing
all sorts of things,

183
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,560
like scheduling, and sorting,
using various kinds of trees,

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,200
including binary trees.

185
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,330
And we have a problem set on
simulating a logic network

186
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,660
using a particular kind of
sorting algorithm in a data

187
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,340
structure.

188
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,150
That is going to be
your second problem set.

189
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:47,190
And more quickly, we're going
to have modules on hashing,

190
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,240
where we do things
like genome comparison.

191
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,330
In past terms we compared a
human genome to a rat genome,

192
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,350
and discovered they
were pretty similar.

193
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,860
99% similar, which
is kind of amazing.

194
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,960
But again, these things
are so large that you

195
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,590
have to have efficiency
in the comparison methods

196
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,460
that you use.

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,690
And you'll find that if you
don't get the complexity low

198
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,300
enough, you just won't
be able to complete--

199
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,950
your program won't be able to
finish running within the time

200
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,260
that your problem set is do.

201
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,760
Right?

202
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,660
Which is a bit of a problem.

203
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,860
So that's something to keep
in mind as you test your code.

204
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,140
The fact is that you will get
large inputs to run your code.

205
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,960
And you want to keep
complexity in mind

206
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,070
as you're coding and thinking
about the pseudocode,

207
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,624
if you will, of your
algorithm itself.

208
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:44,790
We will talk about numerics.

209
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,840
A lot of the time we talk
about such large numbers

210
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,290
that 32 bits isn't enough.

211
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,130
Or 64 bits isn't enough to
represent these numbers.

212
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,910
These numbers have
thousands of bits.

213
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,110
A good example is
RSA encryption,

214
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,140
that is used in
SSL, for example.

215
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,720
And when you go-- use
https on websites,

216
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,710
RSA is used at the back end.

217
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,360
And typically you work
with prime numbers

218
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,510
that are thousands
of bits long in RSA.

219
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,930
So how do you handle that?

220
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,270
How does Python handle that?

221
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,950
How do you write
algorithms that can

222
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,270
deal with what are called
infinite precision numbers?

223
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,500
So we have a module on numerics
in the middle of the term that

224
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,850
talks about that.

225
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,480
Graphs, really a
fundamental data structure

226
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,970
in all of computer science.

227
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,610
You might have heard of the
famous Rubik's cube assignment

228
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,110
from .

229
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,850
006 a 2 by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube.

230
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,690
What's the minimum
number of moves

231
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,240
necessary to go from a
given starting configuration

232
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,640
to the final end configuration,
where all of the faces-- each

233
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,940
of the faces has uniform color?

234
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,830
And that can be posed
as a graph problem.

235
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,052
We'll probably do
that one this term.

236
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,760
In previous terms
we've done other things

237
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,310
like the 15 puzzle.

238
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,170
And so some of
these are tentative.

239
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,420
We definitely know what the
first problem set is like,

240
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,420
but the rest of them are,
at this moment, tentative.

241
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,340
And to finish up shortest paths.

242
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,660
Again in terms past
we've asked you

243
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,380
to write code using a
particular algorithm that

244
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,984
finds the shortest path
from Caltech to MIT.

245
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,150
This time we may do things
a little bit differently.

246
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,150
We were thinking maybe we'll
give you a street map of Boston

247
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,360
and go figure out
if Paul Revere used

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,140
the shortest path to get
to where he was going,

249
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,025
or things like that.

250
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,540
We'll try and make it fun.

251
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,420
Dynamic programming is an
important algorithm design

252
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,690
technique that's used
in many, many problems.

253
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,510
And it can be used to do a
variety of things, including

254
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,600
image compression.

255
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,060
How do you compress an image
so the number of pixels

256
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,960
reduces, but it still
looks like the image

257
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,761
that you started out with,
that had many more pixels?

258
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,260
All right?

259
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,970
So you could use dynamic
programming for that.

260
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,370
And finally, advanced topics,
complexity theory, research

261
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,760
and algorithms.

262
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,590
Hopefully by now-- by
this time in the course,

263
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,330
you have been sold
on algorithms.

264
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,605
And most, if not
all of you, would

265
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,550
want to pursue a
carrier in algorithms.

266
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,680
And we'll give you a sense
of what else is there.

267
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,364
We're just scratching the
surface in this class,

268
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,530
and there's many, many
classes that you can possibly

269
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,650
take if you want to continue
in-- to learn about algorithms,

270
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,790
or to pursue a
career in algorithms.

271
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,580
All right?

272
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,990
So that's the
story of the class,

273
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,840
or the synopsis of the class.

274
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,950
And I encourage you to go spend
a few minutes on the website.

275
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,850
In particular please read the
collaboration policy, and get

276
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,440
a sense of what is
expected of you.

277
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,580
What the rules are in terms
of doing the problem sets.

278
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,100
And the course
grading break down,

279
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,860
the grading policies are all
listed on the website as well.

280
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,000
All right.

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,870
OK.

282
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,210
So let's get started.

283
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,930
I want to talk about
a specific problem.

284
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,000
And talk about algorithms
for a specific problem.

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,560
We picked this problem, because
it's so easy to understand.

286
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,790
And they're fairly
straightforward algorithms

287
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,280
that are not particularly
efficient to solve

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,530
this problem.

289
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,060
And so this is a, kind
of, a toy problem.

290
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,660
But like a lot of
toy problems, it's

291
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,230
very evocative in that it
points out the issues involved

292
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,739
in designing
efficient algorithms.

293
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,280
So we'll start with
a one dimensional

294
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,395
version of what we
call peak finding.

295
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,635
And a peak finder is something
in the one dimensional case.

296
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,240
Runs on an array of numbers.

297
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,770
And I'm just putting--

298
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,020
--symbols for each of
these numbers here.

299
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,546
And the numbers are
positive, negative.

300
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,170
We'll just assume
they're all positive,

301
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,480
it doesn't really matter.

302
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,460
The algorithms we
describe will work.

303
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,330
And so we have this
one dimensional array

304
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,450
that has nine
different positions.

305
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,405
And a through i are numbers.

306
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,030
And we want to find a peak.

307
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,180
And so we have to define
what we mean by a peak.

308
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,320
And so, in particular,
as an example,

309
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,369
position 2 is a
peak if, and only

310
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:16,520
if, b greater than or equal to
a, and b greater than or equal

311
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,020
to c.

312
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,359
So it's really a very local
property corresponding

313
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,270
to a peak.

314
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,020
In the one dimensional
case, it's trivial.

315
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,220
Look to your left.

316
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,990
Look to your right.

317
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,990
If you are equal or greater
than both of the elements

318
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,120
that you see on the left and
the right, you're a peak.

319
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,760
OK?

320
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,690
And in the case of
the edges, you only

321
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,700
have to look to one side.

322
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:53,567
So position 9 is a peak if i
greater than or equal to h.

323
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,400
So you just have to
look to your left there,

324
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,483
because you're all the way
on the right hand side.

325
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:58,270
All right?

326
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,480
So that's it.

327
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,920
And the statement of the
problem, the one dimensional

328
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:13,820
version, is find the
peak if it exists.

329
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,070
All right?

330
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,510
That's all there is to it.

331
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,890
I'm going to give you a
straightforward algorithm.

332
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,630
And then we'll see
if we can improve it.

333
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,270
All right?

334
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,110
You can imagine that the
straightforward algorithm is

335
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,440
something that just, you
know, walks across the array.

336
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,629
But we need that as a starting
point for building something

337
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:44,420
more sophisticated.

338
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:57,340
So let's say we start
from left and all

339
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,500
we have is one
traversal, really.

340
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,930
So let's say we have
1, 2, and then we

341
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,810
have n over 2 over
here corresponding

342
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,620
to the middle of
this n element array.

343
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,970
And then we have
n minus 1, and n.

344
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,090
What I'm interested
in doing is, not only

345
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,880
coming up with a
straightforward algorithm,

346
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,300
but also precisely
characterizing

347
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,030
what its complexity
is in relation

348
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,260
to n, which is the
number of inputs.

349
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,760
Yeah?

350
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,915
Question?

351
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:38,456
AUDIENCE: Why do
you say if it exists

352
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,348
when the criteria
in the [INAUDIBLE]

353
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:41,397
guarantees [INAUDIBLE]?

354
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:42,730
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.

355
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,540
I was going to get to that.

356
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,530
So if you look at the
definition of the peak,

357
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,210
then what I have here is
greater than or equal to.

358
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,010
OK?

359
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,660
And so this-- That's a great
question that was asked.

360
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,470
Why is there "if it
exists" in this problem?

361
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,440
Now in the case where I have
greater than or equal to,

362
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,310
then-- this is a homework
question for you,

363
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:18,240
and for the rest of you-- argue
that any array will always

364
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,610
have a peak.

365
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,790
OK?

366
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,300
Now if you didn't have the
greater than or equal to,

367
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,070
and you had a greater than,
then can you make that argument?

368
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,120
No, you can't.

369
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,820
Right?

370
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,230
So great question.

371
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,859
In this case it's
just a question--

372
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,400
You would want to
modify this problem

373
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,950
statement to find the peak.

374
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,710
But if I had a different
definition of a peak-- and this

375
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,850
is part of algorithmic thinking.

376
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,580
You want to be able to create
algorithms that are general,

377
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,130
so if the problem
definition changes on you,

378
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,300
you still have a starting
point to go attack

379
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,500
the second version
of the problem.

380
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,310
OK?

381
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,479
So you could eliminate
this in the case

382
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,270
of the greater than or
equal to definition.

383
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,664
The "if it exists", because
a peak will always exist.

384
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,330
But you probably want
to argue that when

385
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,950
you want to show the
correctness of your algorithm.

386
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,210
And if in fact you had
a different definition,

387
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,130
well you would have to create
an algorithm that tells you

388
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,310
for sure that a peak
doesn't exist, or find

389
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,900
a peak if it exists.

390
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,400
All right?

391
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
So that's really
the general case.

392
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,830
Many a time it's possible that
you're asked to do something,

393
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,990
and you can't actually give
an answer to the question,

394
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,335
or find something that satisfies
all the constraints required.

395
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:41,710
And in that case, you want to
be able to put up your hand

396
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,470
and say, you know what?

397
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,870
I searched long and hard.

398
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,730
I searched exhaustively.

399
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,930
Here's my argument that
I searched exhaustively,

400
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,101
and I couldn't find it.

401
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,600
Right?

402
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,490
If you do that, you
get to keep your job.

403
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,580
Right?

404
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,390
Otherwise there's
always the case

405
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,060
that you didn't
search hard enough.

406
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,310
So it's nice to
have that argument.

407
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,810
All right?

408
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,080
Great.

409
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,190
Thanks for the question.

410
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,170
Feel free to interrupt.

411
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,840
Raise your hand, and
I'm watching you guys,

412
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,550
and I'm happy to answer
questions at any time.

413
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,540
So let's talk about the
straightforward algorithm.

414
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,510
The straightforward
algorithm is something

415
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,940
that starts from the left
and just walks across.

416
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,285
And you might have something
that looks like that.

417
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:24,960
All right?

418
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,830
By that-- By this I mean
the numbers are increasing

419
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,730
as you start from the
left, the peak is somewhere

420
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,620
in the middle, and then
things start decreasing.

421
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,120
Right?

422
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,570
So in this case, you know,
this might be the peak.

423
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,550
You also may have
a situation where

424
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,240
the peak is all the
way on the right,

425
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,780
you started from the left.

426
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,060
And it's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, literally

427
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,390
in terms of the numbers.

428
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,000
And you're going to look at
n elements going all the way

429
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,800
to the right in order
to find the peak.

430
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,310
So in the case of
the middle you'd

431
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,940
look at n over 2 elements.

432
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,020
If it was right in the middle.

433
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:26,340
And the complexity,
worst case complexity--

434
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,830
--is what we call theta n.

435
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,580
And it's theta n, because
in the worst case,

436
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,294
you may have to look
at all n elements.

437
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:38,710
And that would be the case
where you started from the left

438
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,860
and you had to go all
the way to the right.

439
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,850
Now remember theta n is
essentially something

440
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,830
that's says of the order of n.

441
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,400
So it gives you both the lower
bound and an upper bound.

442
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,470
Big [? O ?] of n is
just upper bound.

443
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,970
And what we're
saying here is, we're

444
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,110
saying this algorithm
that starts from the left

445
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,470
is going to, essentially,
require in the worst case

446
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,740
something that's a
constant times n.

447
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,880
OK?

448
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,210
And you know that
constant could be 1.

449
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,400
You could certainly
set things up that way.

450
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,860
Or if you had a different
kind of algorithm,

451
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,460
maybe you could work
on the constant.

452
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,360
But bottom line, we're only
concerned, at this moment,

453
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,760
about as asymptotic complexity.

454
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,030
And the asymptotic complexity
of this algorithm is linear.

455
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,710
All right?

456
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,150
That make sense?

457
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,930
OK.

458
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,950
So someone help me do better.

459
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,890
How can we do better?

460
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,040
How can we lower the
asymptotic complexity

461
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,700
of a one dimensional
peak finder?

462
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,450
Anybody want to
take a stab at that?

463
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:48,950
Yeah?

464
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,086
Back there.

465
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:52,078
AUDIENCE: Do a
binary search subset.

466
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:54,236
You look at the
middle, and whatever

467
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:58,552
is higher-- whichever side is
higher, then cut that in half,

468
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,290
because you know there's a peak.

469
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:00,410
PROFESSOR: On--

470
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,578
AUDIENCE: For example
if you're in the middle

471
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,492
on the right side--
there's a higher number

472
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:05,116
on the right side--
then you would just

473
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:06,946
look at that, because you know
that your peak's somewhere

474
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:07,446
in there.

475
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:08,900
And you continue
cutting in half.

476
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,360
PROFESSOR: Excellent!

477
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,859
Excellent!

478
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,200
That's exactly right.

479
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,850
So you can-- You can do
something different, which

480
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,240
is essentially try and
break up this problem.

481
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,650
Use a divide and conquer
strategy, and recursively break

482
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,550
up this one dimensional
array into smaller arrays.

483
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,940
And try and get this
complexity down.

484
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,440
Yeah?

485
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,239
AUDIENCE: Are we assuming
that there's only one peak?

486
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,280
PROFESSOR: No, we're not.

487
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,980
AUDIENCE: OK.

488
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,219
PROFESSOR: It's find
a peak if it exists.

489
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,760
And in this case
it's, "find a peak",

490
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,610
because of the definition.

491
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,910
We don't really need
this as it was discussed.

492
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,660
All right?

493
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,180
OK.

494
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,080
So--

495
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,392
So that was a great answer,
and-- You know this class

496
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:54,850
after while is
going to get boring.

497
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,770
Right?

498
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,650
Every class gets boring.

499
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,777
So we, you know, try and
break the monotony here a bit.

500
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:02,860
And so-- And then the other
thing that we realized

501
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,790
was that these seats
you're sitting on-- this

502
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,998
is a nice classroom-- but
the seats you're sitting on

503
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:07,750
are kind of hard.

504
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,250
Right?

505
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,787
So what Eric and I
did was we decided

506
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:12,620
we'll help you guys
out, especially the ones

507
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,870
who are-- who are
interacting with us.

508
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,580
And we have these--

509
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,610
[LAUGHTER]

510
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,145
--cushions that
are 6.006 cushions.

511
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:25,170
And, you know, that's a 2
by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube here.

512
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,410
And since you answered the first
question, you get a cushion.

513
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,510
This is kind of like a
Frisbee, but not really.

514
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,010
So--

515
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,510
[LAUGHTER]

516
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,190
I'm not sure-- I'm not sure
I'm going to get it to you.

517
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,565
But the other
thing I want to say

518
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,970
is this is not a baseball game.

519
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,469
Right?

520
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:40,560
Where you just grab the
ball as it comes by.

521
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,670
This is meant for him, my
friend in the red shirt.

522
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,920
So here you go.

523
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,820
Ah, too bad.

524
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,620
All right.

525
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,580
It is soft.

526
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,255
So, you know, it won't-- it
won't hurt you if hits you.

527
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:51,910
[LAUGHTER]

528
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,540
All right.

529
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,216
So we got a bunch of these.

530
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:57,300
And raise your hands,
you know, going

531
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,025
to ask-- There's going
to be-- I think-- There's

532
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,150
some trivial questions that
we're going to ask just

533
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,180
to make sure you're awake.

534
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,750
So an answer to that
doesn't get you a cushion.

535
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,514
But an answer like--
What's your name?

536
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:11,180
AUDIENCE: Chase.

537
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,890
PROFESSOR: Chase.

538
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,134
An answer like
Chase just gave is--

539
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,050
that's a good answer to
a nontrivial question.

540
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,500
That gets you a cushion.

541
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,290
OK?

542
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,300
All right, great.

543
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,230
So let's put up by
Chase's algorithm up here.

544
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,510
I'm going to write it
out for the 1D version.

545
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,205
So what we have here is
a recursive algorithm.

546
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,800
So the picture you want
to keep in your head

547
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,860
is this picture
that I put up there.

548
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,010
And this is a divide
and conquer algorithm.

549
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,140
You're going to see this over
and over-- this paradigm--

550
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,360
over and over in 6.006.

551
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,745
We're going to look at
the n over 2 position.

552
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,700
And we're going to
look to the left,

553
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,010
and we're going to
look to the right.

554
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,420
And we're going to
do that in sequence.

555
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,920
So--

556
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:50,950
--if a n over 2 is less than
a n over 2 minus 1, then--

557
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,380
--only look at the left half.

558
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:04,410
1 through n over 2 minus 1 to
look for peak-- for a peak.

559
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:08,880
All right?

560
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,295
So that's step one.

561
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,170
And you know I could
put it on the right hand

562
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,990
side or the left hand side,
doesn't really matter.

563
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,311
I chose to do the left hand
side first, the left half.

564
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:24,570
And so what I've done is,
through that one step,

565
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:30,010
if in fact you have that
condition-- a n over 2

566
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,630
is less than a n over 2 minus
1-- then you move to your left

567
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,490
and you work on one
half of the problem.

568
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:43,120
But if that's not the case,
then if n over-- n over 2

569
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,170
is less than a over n
over-- n by 2 plus 1,

570
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:57,520
then only look at n over 2
plus 1 through n for a peak.

571
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,960
So I haven't bothered
writing out all the words.

572
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,480
They're exactly the same
as the left hand side.

573
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,160
You just look to
the right hand side.

574
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,430
Otherwise if both of these
conditions don't fire,

575
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,160
you're actually done.

576
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,660
OK?

577
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,130
That's actually the best case
in terms of finishing early,

578
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,340
at least in this recursive step.

579
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,580
Because now the n over
2 position is a peak.

580
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,500
Because what you found is
that the n over 2 position

581
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,740
is greater than or equal to
both of its adjacent positions,

582
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,850
and that's exactly the
definition of a peak.

583
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,430
So you're done.

584
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,350
OK?

585
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,500
So all of this is good.

586
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:53,307
You want to write an argument
that this algorithm is correct.

587
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:54,890
And I'm not going
to bother with that.

588
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,530
I just wave my hands a
bit, and you all nodded,

589
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,230
so we're done with that.

590
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:07,310
But the point being you
will see in your problem set

591
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:11,560
a precise argument for a more
complicated algorithm, the 2D

592
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,720
version of this.

593
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,900
And that should be a template
for you to go write a proof,

594
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,200
or an argument, a
formal argument,

595
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,620
that a particular
algorithm is correct.

596
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,550
That it does what
it claims to do.

597
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:30,370
And in this case it's two,
three lines of careful reasoning

598
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,520
that essentially say, given
the definition of the peak,

599
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,600
that this is going to
find a peak in the array

600
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,860
that you're given.

601
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,900
All right?

602
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,910
So we all believe that
this algorithm is correct.

603
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,650
Let's talk now about the
complexity of this algorithm.

604
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,630
Because the whole
point of this algorithm

605
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,700
was because we didn't
like this theta

606
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,350
n complexity corresponding to
the straightforward algorithm.

607
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,470
So it'd like to do better.

608
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,830
So what I'd like to
do is ask one of you

609
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,890
to give me a recurrence relation
of the kind, you know, T of n

610
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,040
equals blah, blah, blah.

611
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,310
That would correspond to
this recursive algorithm,

612
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,020
this divide and
conquer algorithm.

613
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,050
And then using that, I'd like
to get to the actual complexity

614
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,280
in terms of what the theta
of complexity corresponds to.

615
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,780
Yeah?

616
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,752
Back there?

617
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:39,680
AUDIENCE: So the worst
case scenario if T of n

618
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,795
is going to be some
constant amount of time--

619
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:43,420
PROFESSOR: Yep.

620
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,116
AUDIENCE: --it takes to
investigate whether a certain

621
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,851
element is [INAUDIBLE], plus--

622
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:50,713
[COUGH]

623
00:32:50,713 --> 00:32:52,022
--T of n over 2?

624
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:52,730
PROFESSOR: Great.

625
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,550
Exactly right.

626
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,460
That's exactly right.

627
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,370
So if you look at this
algorithm and you say,

628
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,290
from a computation
standpoint, can I

629
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,510
write an equation
corresponding to the execution

630
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,570
of this algorithm?

631
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,350
And you say, T of n is the work
that this algorithm does on--

632
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,630
as input of size n.

633
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,130
OK?

634
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,550
Then I can write this equation.

635
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,530
And this theta 1 corresponds
to the two comparisons

636
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,697
that you do looking at--
potentially the two comparisons

637
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:39,280
that you do-- looking
at the left hand

638
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,440
side and the right hand side.

639
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,580
So that's-- 2 is a constant,
so that's why we put theta 1.

640
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,200
All right?

641
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,060
So you get a cushion, too.

642
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,630
Watch out guys.

643
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,780
Whoa!

644
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,192
Oh actually that wasn't so bad.

645
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:54,000
Good.

646
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,620
Veers left, Eric.

647
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,420
Veers left.

648
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,360
So if you take this and
you start expanding it,

649
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,180
eventually you're going
to get to the base

650
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:12,091
case, which is T
of 1 is theta 1.

651
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:12,590
Right?

652
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,580
Because you have a one element
array you just for that array

653
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,650
it's just going to
return that as a peak.

654
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,130
And so if you do that, and
you expand it all the way out,

655
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:31,080
then you can write T of n
equals theta 1 plus theta 1.

656
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:39,300
And you're going to do this
log to the base 2 of n times.

657
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,660
And adding these
all up, gives you

658
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,360
a complexity theta log 2 of n.

659
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,330
Right?

660
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,089
So now you compare
this with that.

661
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,630
And there's really
a huge difference.

662
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,440
There's an exponential
difference.

663
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,860
If you coded up this
algorithm in Python--

664
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,170
and I did-- both these
algorithms for the 1D version--

665
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:14,160
and if you run it on n
being 10 million or so,

666
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,820
then this algorithm
takes 13 seconds.

667
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,320
OK?

668
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,880
The-- The theta 10
algorithm takes 13 seconds.

669
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,070
And this one takes
0.001 seconds.

670
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,570
OK?

671
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,929
Huge difference.

672
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:30,345
So there is a big difference
between theta n and theta log

673
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,970
n.

674
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,840
It's literally the difference
between 2 raised to n, and n.

675
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,120
It makes sense to try
and reduce complexity

676
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,000
as you can see,
especially if you're

677
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,450
talking about large inputs.

678
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,390
All right?

679
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,860
And you'll see that
more clearly as we

680
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,300
go to a 2D version
of this problem.

681
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,202
All right?

682
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:53,910
So you can't really
do better for the 1D.

683
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,750
The 1D is a
straightforward problem.

684
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,500
It gets a little
more interesting--

685
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,080
the problems get a
little-- excuse me,

686
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,600
the algorithms get a
little more sophisticated

687
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,340
when we look at a 2D
version of peak finding.

688
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,535
So let's talk about
the 2D version.

689
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,250
So as you can imagine
in the 2D version

690
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,715
you have a matrix, or a
two dimensional array.

691
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:29,575
And we'll say this thing
has n rows and m columns.

692
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,190
And now we have to
define what a peak is.

693
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,350
And it's a hill.

694
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,540
It's the obvious
definition of a peak.

695
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:50,490
So if you had a in
here, c, b, d, e.

696
00:36:50,490 --> 00:37:02,250
Then as you can guess, a is
a 2D peak if, and only if,

697
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,830
a greater than or equal to b;
a greater than or equal to d, c

698
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,061
and e.

699
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,560
All right?

700
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,230
So it's a little hill up there.

701
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,730
All right?

702
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,120
And again I've used the
greater than or equal to here,

703
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,490
so that's similar to
the 1D in the case

704
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,345
that you'll always find
a peak in any 2D matrix.

705
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,210
Now again I'll give you the
straightforward algorithm,

706
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,640
and we'll call it the
Greedy Ascent algorithm.

707
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,820
And the Greedy Ascent algorithm
essentially picks a direction

708
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,560
and, you know, tries to
follow that direction in order

709
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,770
to find a peak.

710
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:01,840
So for example, if I
had this particular--

711
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:10,790
--matrix; 14, 13,
12, 15, 9, 11, 17--

712
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,850
Then what might happen is if
I started at some arbitrary

713
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,360
midpoint-- So the
Greedy Ascent algorithm

714
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,210
has to make choices
as to where to start.

715
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,142
Just like we had
different cases here,

716
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,100
you have to make a choice
as to where to start.

717
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,770
You might want to
start in the middle,

718
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,560
and you might want to
work your way left first.

719
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,380
Or you're going to all--
You just keep going left,

720
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,720
our keep going right.

721
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,340
And if you hit an
edge, you go down.

722
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,450
So you make some choices as
to what the default traversal

723
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,810
directions are.

724
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,820
And so if you say you
want to start with 12,

725
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,050
you are going to go look
for something to left.

726
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,470
And if it's greater than, you're
going to follow that direction.

727
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,950
If it's not, if it's
less, then you're

728
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,200
going to go in the other
direction, in this case,

729
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,160
for example.

730
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:13,120
So in this case you'll go to
12, 13 , 14, 15, 16, 17, 19,

731
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,230
and 20.

732
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,765
And you'd find-- You
'd find this peak.

733
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:21,680
Now I haven't given you
the specific details

734
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,750
of a Greedy Ascent algorithm.

735
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:33,400
But I think if you look at
the worst case possibilities

736
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,370
here, with respect
to a given matrix,

737
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,920
and for any given
starting point,

738
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,270
and for any given strategy-- in
terms of choosing left first,

739
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,630
versus right first, or down
first versus up first--

740
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,370
you will have a
situation where-- just

741
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,450
like we had in the 1D
case-- you may end up

742
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:02,015
touching a large fraction of
the elements in this 2D array.

743
00:40:02,015 --> 00:40:02,750
OK?

744
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,190
So in this case, we
ended up, you know,

745
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,890
touching a bunch of
different elements.

746
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,529
And it's quite possible that
you could end up touching--

747
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,820
starting from the midpoint--
you could up touching half

748
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,990
the elements, and in some cases,
touching all the elements.

749
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:23,000
So if you do a worst case
analysis of this algorithm--

750
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,410
a particular algorithm with
particular choices in terms

751
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:30,370
of the starting point and
the direction of search--

752
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,750
a Greedy Ascent algorithm would
have theta n m complexity.

753
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,320
All right?

754
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:42,480
And in the case where n
equals m, or m equals n,

755
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,840
you'd have theta n
squared complexity.

756
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,290
OK?

757
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,440
I won't spend very
much time on this,

758
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,150
because I want to talk
to you about the divide

759
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:58,020
and conquer versions of this
algorithm for the 2D peak.

760
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,860
But hopefully you're
all with me with respect

761
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,530
to what the worst
case complexity is.

762
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,990
All right?

763
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,070
People buy that?

764
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,570
Yeah.

765
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,390
Question back there.

766
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,264
AUDIENCE: Can you-- Is
that an approximation?

767
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:14,630
Or can you actually get
to n times m traversals?

768
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,780
PROFESSOR: So there are specific
Greedy Ascent algorithms,

769
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,680
and specific matrices
where, if I give you

770
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,680
the code for the algorithm, and
I give you a specific matrix,

771
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,200
that I could make you touch
all of these elements.

772
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,870
That's correct.

773
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,600
So we're talking
about worst case.

774
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,260
You're being very
paranoid when you

775
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,540
talk about worst
case complexity.

776
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,800
And so I'm-- hand
waving a bit here,

777
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,150
simply because I haven't
given you the specifics

778
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,150
of the algorithm yet.

779
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,650
Right?

780
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,669
This is really a
set of algorithms,

781
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,210
because I haven't
given you the code,

782
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,668
I haven't told you
where it starts,

783
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,050
and which direction it goes.

784
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,380
But you go, do
that, fix it, and I

785
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,380
would be the person who tries to
find the worst case complexity.

786
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,250
Suddenly it's very
easy to get to theta n

787
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,140
m in terms of having some
constant multiplying n times m.

788
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,810
But you can definitely
get to that constant

789
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,520
being very close to 1.

790
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,910
OK?

791
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,350
If not 1.

792
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,190
All right.

793
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,480
So let's talk about
divide and conquer.

794
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,720
And let's say that
I did something

795
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,770
like this, where I just tried
to jam the binary search

796
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,340
algorithm into the 2D version.

797
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:26,840
All right?

798
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,830
So what I'm going to do is--

799
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:55,430
--I'm going to pick the middle
column, j equals m over 2.

800
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,710
And I'm going to
find a 1D peak using

801
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,810
whatever algorithm I want.

802
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,820
And I'll probably end up using
the more efficient algorithm,

803
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,850
the binary search
version that's gone

804
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,530
all the way to the left
of the board there.

805
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,000
And let's say I find a
binary peak at (i, j).

806
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,060
Because I've picked a column,
and I'm just finding a 1D peak.

807
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,550
So this is j equals m over 2.

808
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,690
That's i.

809
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,850
Now I use (i,j).

810
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:38,730
In particular row i as a start--

811
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,310
--to find a 1D peak on row i.

812
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,041
And I stand up here,
I'm really happy.

813
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:50,540
OK?

814
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,440
Because I say, wow.

815
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,850
I picked a middle column,
I found a 1D peak,

816
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:01,350
that is theta m complexity to
find a 1D peak as we argued.

817
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:06,665
And one side-- the theta m--

818
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:07,659
AUDIENCE: Log n.

819
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:08,700
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

820
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,730
You're right.

821
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,490
The log n complexity,
that's what this was.

822
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,031
So I do have that here.

823
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:15,530
Yeah.

824
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,470
Log n complexity.

825
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,920
Thanks, Eric.

826
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:26,130
And then once I do that, I
can find a 1D peak on row i.

827
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,690
In this case row
i would be m wide,

828
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,630
so it would be log m complexity.

829
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,840
If n equals m, then I have
a couple of steps of log n,

830
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,050
and I'm done.

831
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,030
All right?

832
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,320
Am I done?

833
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,640
No.

834
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,770
Can someone tell me
why I'm not done?

835
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:43,270
Precisely?

836
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,947
Yep.

837
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,841
AUDIENCE: Because when
you do the second part

838
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:50,155
to find the peak in
row i, you might not

839
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,987
have that column
peak-- There might not

840
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:54,320
be a peak on the column anymore.

841
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,240
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly correct.

842
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,280
So this algorithm is incorrect.

843
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,780
OK?

844
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,460
It doesn't work.

845
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,380
It's efficient, but incorrect.

846
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,390
OK?

847
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,215
It's-- You want to be correct.

848
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:09,640
You know being correcting
and inefficient

849
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,580
is definitely better than
being inefficient-- I'm sorry.

850
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,790
Being incorrect and efficient.

851
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,870
So this is an
efficient algorithm,

852
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:22,077
in the sense that it will
only take log n time,

853
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:22,910
but it doesn't work.

854
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,620
And I'll give you
a simple example

855
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,650
here where it doesn't work.

856
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,680
The problem is--

857
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,960
--a 2D peak--

858
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,150
--may not exist--

859
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,090
--on row i.

860
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,700
And here's an example of that.

861
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,360
Actually this is-- This is
exactly the example of that.

862
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,690
Let's say that I
started with this row.

863
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,057
Since it's-- I'm starting
with the middle row,

864
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,890
and I could start with
this one or that one.

865
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,640
Let's say I started
with that one.

866
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,350
I end up finding a peak.

867
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:22,330
And if this were 10 up here,
I'd choose 12 as a peak.

868
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,856
And it's quite possible
that I return 12 as a peak.

869
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:27,900
Even though 19 is
bigger, because 12

870
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,370
is a peak given
10 and 11 up here.

871
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,060
And then when I choose
this particular row,

872
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,720
and I find a peak on
this row, it would be 14.

873
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,870
That is a 1D peak on this row.

874
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,840
But 14 is not a 2D peak.

875
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,790
OK?

876
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,402
So this particular example,
14 would return 14.

877
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:50,740
And 14 is not a 2D peak.

878
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,730
All right?

879
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,460
You can collect your
cushion after the class.

880
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,880
So not so good.

881
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,430
Look like an efficient
algorithm, but doesn't work.

882
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,180
All right?

883
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,290
So how can we get to
something that actually works?

884
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:14,300
So the last algorithm that
I'm going to show you--

885
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,920
And you'll see four different
algorithms in your problem

886
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,260
set--

887
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,340
--that you'll have to analyze
the complexity for and decide

888
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,180
if they're efficient,
and if they're correct.

889
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,440
But here's a-- a
recursive version

890
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,650
that is better than,
in terms of complexity,

891
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,120
than the Greedy
Ascent algorithm.

892
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,410
And this one works.

893
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,470
So what I'm going to do
is pick a middle column.

894
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,435
j equals m over 2 as before.

895
00:47:54,050 --> 00:48:02,480
I'm going to find the
global maximum on column j.

896
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,690
And that's going
to be at (i, j).

897
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:18,230
I'm going to compare (i comma
j minus 1), (i comma j),

898
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,440
and (i,j plus 1).

899
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,620
Which means that once I've
found the maximum in this row,

900
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,890
all I'm going to look to
the left and the right,

901
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,920
and compare.

902
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,825
I'm going to pick
the left columns.

903
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:40,890
If (i comma j minus 1) is
greater than (i comma j)--

904
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,420
and similarly for the right.

905
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:55,720
And if in fact I-- either
of these two conditions

906
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,210
don't fire, and what
I have is (i comma j)

907
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:04,280
is greater than or equal
to (i comma j minus 1)

908
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,630
and (i comma j plus
1), then I'm done.

909
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,760
Just like I had
for the 1D version.

910
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,500
If (i comma j) is greater
than or equal to (i comma

911
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:26,350
j minus 1), and (i comma j
plus 1), that implies (i, j)

912
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,591
is a 2D peak.

913
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,212
OK?

914
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:30,670
And the reason that
is the case, is

915
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:35,902
because (i comma j) was the
maximum element in that column.

916
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:37,360
So you know that
you've compared it

917
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,520
to all of the adjacent elements,
looking up and looking down,

918
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,000
that's the maximum element.

919
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,150
Now you've look at the
left and the right,

920
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,750
and in fact it's greater
than or equal to the elements

921
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,110
on the left and the right.

922
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,290
And so therefore it's a 2D peak.

923
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,270
OK?

924
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:57,710
So in this case, when you pick
the left or the right columns--

925
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,570
you'll pick one of
them-- you're going

926
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:08,025
to solve the new problem with
half the number of columns.

927
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,580
All right?

928
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,965
And again, you have to
go through an analysis,

929
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:24,950
or an argument, to make sure
that this algorithm is correct.

930
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,740
But its intuitively correct,
simply because it matches

931
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,190
the 1D version
much more closely.

932
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,870
And you also have your condition
where you break away right

933
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:41,160
here, where you have a 2D
peak, just like the 1D version.

934
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,930
And what you've done
is break this matrix up

935
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,190
into half the size.

936
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:51,090
And that's essentially
why this algorithm works.

937
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,806
When you have a single column--

938
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:09,610
--find the global
maximum and you're done.

939
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,110
All right?

940
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,570
So that's the base case.

941
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,670
So let me end with
just writing out

942
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,870
what the recurrence relation
for the complexity of this

943
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:22,481
is, and argue what the overall
complexity of this algorithm

944
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:22,980
is.

945
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:26,720
And then I'll give
you the bad news.

946
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:31,280
All right.

947
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,260
So overall what you have is, you
have something like T of (n, m)

948
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:42,570
equals T of (n, m
over 2) plus theta n.

949
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,640
Why is that?

950
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,830
Well n is the number of rows,
m is the number of columns.

951
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,430
In one case you'll be
breaking things down

952
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:54,630
into half the number of
columns, which is m over 2.

953
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,520
And in order to find
the global maximum,

954
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,220
you'll be doing theta
n work, because you're

955
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,495
finding the global maximum.

956
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:01,995
Right?

957
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:05,270
You just have to
scan it-- this--

958
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:08,840
That's the way-- That's
what it's going to take.

959
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,960
And so if you do that, and
you go run it through--

960
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,210
and you know that T of
(n, 1) is theta n-- which

961
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,880
is this last part over
here-- that's your base case.

962
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:28,560
You get T of (n, m) is theta
of n added to theta of n,

963
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:34,820
log of m times--
log 2 of m times.

964
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:42,250
Which is theta of
n-- log 2 of m.

965
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,640
All right?

966
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,120
So you're not done
with peak finding.

967
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:53,082
What you'll see is at four
algorithms coded in Python--

968
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,290
I'm not going to give away
what those algorithms are,

969
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,090
but you'll have
to recognize them.

970
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,180
You will have seen versions
of those algorithms

971
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,850
already in lecture.

972
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:06,210
And your job is going to be to
analyze the algorithms, as I

973
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,690
said before, prove that
one of them is correct,

974
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,784
and find counter-examples for
the ones that aren't correct.

975
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:14,200
The course staff
will stick around

976
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,110
here to answer questions--
logistical questions--

977
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,990
or questions about lecture.

978
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,650
And I owe that
gentleman a cushion.
