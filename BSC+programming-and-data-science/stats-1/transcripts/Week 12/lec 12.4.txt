Continuous random variable Exponential distribution
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
The next distribution we are going to discuss when we are talking about continuous
distributions is what we refer to as a exponential distribution. Again, exponential distribution
has a lot of application. Typically, exponential distributions are used to model inter-arrival
times in a queuing system, and service times also when we are having queues.
Not only queues wherever you have the model system where you have a sequence of people
arriving into any particular system or it could be a bank, it could be a hospital, then the interarrival times between the people who are arriving and the service times typically are modeled
using an exponential distribution. So, we are going to spend some time to understand about
this exponential distribution.
So, a continuous random variable X, so a random variable X is said to be a exponential
distribution with parameter 
. So, X is a random variable, it could measure anything, it could
measure the amount of time, but it is said to be exponential distribution with parameter 
its probability density function is given as
parameter of the exponential distribution.
. So, this is called the
(Refer Slide Time: 1:59)
So, for different values of the parameter. So, if your 
 =1, you see that this ( ) just reduces
, so for 
 =1 you can see the red curve, it is an exponential curve. For 
 =2 you can see
that it is
which is the blue brown curve, and for 
 =1/2, ( )
, which is
the blue curve.
So, you can see that depending on what is your parameter the PDF of this exponential
distribution is going to take the different curves.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:53)
Now, what is the CDF or the cumulative distribution function for the exponential
distribution?
Recall the CDF,
. This is how we define for a
continuous random variable.
So, this for X is less than 0,
0, so (
Now, this term is going to vanish because it is just going to be 0 and it is going to be
. So, if a is less than so for any value since x greater than 0, it is going to be
so (
So, now we can see that this
out and I get this is 
, again, I can remove 
cancels out which will give me the CDF, is nothing ( )
(Refer Slide Time: 4:56)
Again for different values of 
, we know that F(x) will always lie between 0 and 1. So, for
different values of 
, you can see that for all below x equal to 0 is going to be 0 and then all
of them taper off at 1 and these are the shapes of the cumulative distribution function.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:21)
What is the expectation of this random variable? To get the expectation and variance of the
exponential distribution, we will just introduce an
I am not going to do the entire working here, but you can strap that if you apply integration
by parts, we can obtain the following that
to check using the formula
by parts and check that
, . This I leave it as an exercise
, use expect integration
. I will leave it as an exercise.

Now, once you accept this entity, or this identity, I can verify for n =1,
x and E[1]=1, I get the
I already know
Var(X)=
. For n = 2, I have
, so I get
. Again, the computational formula for
,Hence, I have shown that variance of x is
(Refer Slide Time: 8:17)
So, what does this mean? It tells us that the mean. So, if I have a exponential distribution with
parameter , what it tells us is the mean of the distribution is just the reciprocal of the
parameter 1/
and the variances square of the mean. That is what it is an important
observation and this property actually helps when you come for application or modeling
situations using an exponential distribution.
So, let us look at the application of the exponential distribution. When we look at an
application of the exponential distribution, let us go to the following problem.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:09)
So, the exponential distribution arises, as the distribution of the amount of time. Again,
remember we are measuring time. Suppose the length of a phone call in minutes is an
exponential random variable with a parameter
=0.1. So, if the
=0.1, I know the
mean=1/ , which is lambda = 0.1, mean is 1/0.1=10. In other words, I can say that every 10
minutes of phone call comes or it is the mean or an average, the distribution of time.
If somebody arrives immediately ahead of you at public telephone both, what is the
probability that you will have to wait for more than 10 minutes? So, I know X is an
exponential distribution with =0.1. So, I am going to wait for more than 10 minutes is
), and between 10 and 20 minutes is going to be (
Let us answer each one of them.
. And so, this is =0.1, (
hence I know that (
about 0.368.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:27)
Recall,
, and
) is equal to
, which is approximately
Similarly, if I want to know
. So, this is
). Again,
). So,
the probability that I have to wait for more than, so the probability I will have to wait for
more than between 10 and 20 minutes is equal to
, which is approximately point
0.233.

So, in summary, what we have seen so far is we looked at certain continuous distributions,
and in particular, we looked at the uniform distribution. We looked at a case of a non-uniform
distribution, we looked at an example of a triangular distribution, we looked at the PDF, the
CDF the expectation and the variance of an exponential distribution. These are commonly
arising continuous distributions. There are many more continuous distributions. For example,
the gamma distribution is another important distribution, which arises a lot in modeling, but
the most important distribution is, what we refer to as the normal distribution.
So, the next week, we are going to spend our time to understand the normal distribution. In
particular, we will again start with what is the PDF of a normal distribution, the shape of the
normal distribution and how it varies with respect to the parameters of the distribution, the
CDF of the normal distribution, the expectation and the variance of a normal distribution.
And finally, we are going to spend a lot of time in understanding about applications. Before
we go to applications, we will introduce what is a standard normal distribution and then we
are going to look at how we will answer a lot of questions based on the distribution. So, this
is the last topic of the course.
