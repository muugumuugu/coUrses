Mohit goes to the college library. On the upper shelf, there are 7 books related to mechanical
engineering and five books related to electrical engineering. The shelf is high so he is not able to
see the books. He selected three books at random. What is the probability that one is mechanical
and the other two are electrical?
So, again we are overall the sample space is number of ways of picking three books out of
twelve, so that will be 20C3 and over here in the numerator we have 5C2 which is two books from
electrical, five books of electrical into 7C1 which is one book of mechanical out of the 7. So, that
gives us
which is roughly 0.318. So, this is the probability.
