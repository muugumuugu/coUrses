In this question we have 30000 students who have joined the IITM online degree course in Data
Science and the degree program sent a feedback form to 1000 randomly selected students. Now,
Mary and Asad have joined this program. What is the probability that Mary got the feedback
form and Asad did not?
So, here we have the two students Mary and Asad. Probability that Mary got the feedback from
would be if she is in the 1000, so that would be
and the probability that Asad did not get
the feedback form would be the remaining, he Asad should be in the remaining
. And for
both of these to happen together we multiply the probabilities. So, these two cancel off, these
two cancel off, so we get
, this is the probability.
