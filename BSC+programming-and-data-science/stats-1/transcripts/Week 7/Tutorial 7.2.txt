In a nut and bolt manufacturing company, a quality engineer inspects pairs of nuts and bolts. In a
sample of 200 pairs, 8 are defective, so out of the sample is of 200 and 8 are defective. And the
quality engineer randomly selects 10 pairs, so of these 200, the quality engineer is selecting 10
pairs. What is the probability that exactly three pairs out of the 10 are defective?
So, if we look at this as number of possibilities where our condition is being satisfied divided by
the total number of possibilities. We can look at it this way the denominator which is the total
number of possibilities will be 200C10. So, you are picking 10 pairs out of 200 randomly and the
number of ways you can do it is 200C10 these are the total number of possibilities.
And now for these exactly three pairs to be defective those three should come from these 8, so
that would be 8C3 multiplied by the remaining 7 should come from the remaining 192 pairs. So,
that would be 192C7. So, this should be our answer, if you calculate it, it is going to come to about
0.00426. So, that is quite small, anyway this is the probability.
