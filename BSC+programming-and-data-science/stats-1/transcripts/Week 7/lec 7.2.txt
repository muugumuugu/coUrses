Probability- Events and Basic Operations on Events
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, the next building block, we need to understand, is what is a event. So, event is a collection
of basic outcomes. For example, when I toss a coin once, I know my basic outcome is a head
or a tail, when I roll a die. So, this is a, when I toss a coin, when I roll a die; my collection is
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A basic outcome is what I have, when I actually roll a die. That is what, is a
basic outcome.
Now, I can define an event which is a collection of these basic events. So, for example, if
I define an event {1, 3, 5}; I know the outcome of rolling a die is an odd number. So, it is again
a collection of basic outcomes, but it is a subset of my total sample space. I could similarly
define another event which is {2, 4, 6} which is again a subset of my total sample space. It is
again a collection of the basic outcomes.
Now when I toss a coin twice, I know my sample space is {
}. Now, I can define
an event which is {
}, which I can see, it is again a. It is a set of basic outcome here it is
a singleton. It is only 1 element, it is only 1 basic outcome, but nevertheless it is a event. So,
we need to understand that, given a random experiment, we need to understand, how we define
these events. We need to also understand that, these events are subsets of my sample space.
So, event is a subset of the sample space, and we articulate it as saying that, an event has
occurred if the outcome is contained in the subset. So, I will say a event, that is a event of an
odd number has occurred, if the outcome, what is a outcome, 1 is contained in my subset.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:45)
So now, let us go back to our examples. So, when I am guessing an answer to a 4 option
multiple choice question. I can just define an event, that the answer is A. My event, I can
represent it as a singleton set {
}. Again order of finish in a race with 6 students, suppose, I
define my event to be A is the finisher, or the first person who has come first in the race.
So, you can see that, the event would be all possible permutations where A has appeared first.
So, there are, we know that, if I fix A in the first position; the other B, C, D, E and F can be
arranged in 5! ways. So, the event E, in itself will have about 5! outcomes. We know that, this
is a subset of my original sample space.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:54)
Now when I toss a coin twice, and note the outcomes; the event head on the first toss. So, I
know that my sample space here is {
}. The event that, head appears in the first
toss, again is a subset of my sample space. Measuring the life time, I can define an event, that
my bulb has lasted for 4 hours, or has, is actually my bulb fails after 4 hours. In which case my
event is, the life time is less than or equal to 4 hours, or my bulb has failed within 4 hours; my
event can be represented by {
 4}.
So, we can see that, coming from a random experiment and a sample space; sample space is
the set of all possible basic outcomes. I define what is an event which is a subset of my sample
space but this is also a set of basic outcomes. So, when we have a sample space and 
 is the
set of basic outcomes we know that we can define all possible subsets of this sample space as
events. Now, do all the possible subsets makes sense that is something which we need to see.
But we know that, theoretically we can define all subsets as events. In a theoretical way,
whether they make sense or not, we need to see, depending on the context of the experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:47)
Now, because events are again subsets. So, I have an event. Event is also a set. Now I know,
the minute I say that, 
 is an event; then I can talk about all possible set operations. So, the 3
key set operations we are going to see, are. So, I have what I can refer to as set operations on
my events because I realize an event is a set. What are the possible set operations? The 3 set
operations, basic set operations, we are going to talk over.
What do we mean by union of two events? What do we mean by intersection of two events?
And what do we mean by complement of a event? So, these are the basic set operations, which
we are interested in knowing. So, suppose I am given two events; 
 and 
. I know that S is my
sample space. Given S is my sample space I know both 
 and 
 are subsets of my sample space
because they are events.
Now I can be define a new event (
) to consist of all outcomes that are in 
 or both;
that is what I refer or I mean by (
). So, the event (
) will occur, if either 
occurs.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:35)
So now, let us look at a few examples. Suppose my event E is 
1 , suppose my event 
is answer A, event 
 is answer is B, answer is either A or B can be defined by the event (
2 ) which can be represented by {
(Refer Slide Time: 08:01)
Let us go to the next example. Order of finish in a race, suppose my 
1 event is A finishes the
race first. So, in this I have all the outcomes where A is finishing first. Event B is, B is coming
second in the race. So, you can see that B is occupying the second position here. Again, I fix B
in the second position. Total number of outcomes here is again 5! because I fixed B in the
second position.
The other things are, I have 5 places which have, can be occupied by the 5 available alphabets,
and that can be done in 5! way. So, the event A union, or (
2 ) can be described as either
A comes first or B comes second and that is. So, you can see that, this includes ABCDEF which
is common to these two; ABCDFE is common to these two, this event ABDCFE is also
common to both of them. But this event is not in B, but I am including it here because it is
occurring in A.
So, this event AFEDBC does not have B in the second position, but I am including it in (
2 ) because it is occurring in A. And this outcome CBADEF is not in A because A is not the
first finisher here. In this event CBAD, in this outcome CBADEF, A is not the finisher. So, this
outcome is not a part of A, but we are including it. It is not, this outcome is not a part of your
1 but we are including it in (
2 ) because it is an outcome in 
So, the set of outcomes where either A comes first, or B comes second constitutes this (
2 ) event. And I can describe it as either A comes first or B comes second. So, it may, it is a
meaningful event to have. So, would this include the event where B comes first? The answer is
would this include the event where B comes first? B comes second, so, B comes first is not
included here. But would it include C coming first? Answer is yes because we have seen here.
Would it include D coming first? Yes, if the outcome is a DBACEF, yes because that is
DBACEF is a outcome in my 
2 set. So, you can see that, it includes all the possible outcomes
where either A is first or B is second.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:13)
Now let us look at an example of tossing 2 coins, and noting the outcome. Let me define my
first event as head on the first toss. I know if it is a head on the first toss, 
1 is {HH, HT}. Head
on the second toss is {HH, TH}. This is the head on the second toss. So, if I am defining an
event where I say that head occurs either in the first toss or in the second toss. So, my outcomes
2 ) is {HH, HT, TH}. So, this tells that head appears either in my first toss, or head
appears either in first coin or second coin. That is how we can express this event (
2 ) .
(Refer Slide Time: 12:19)
Now, the next set operation is what we refer to as a intersection of events. So, now given 2
events 
 and 
. Again, I know these are subsets of my sample space. I can define a new event,
and I represent it by (
). Now, this event (
) consists of all outcomes, that are in
outcomes that are in both 
 and F. Earlier it was either 
 or 
. Here it is both 
 and F. So, that
is, so 
, the event (
)will occur if both 
 and 
 occur. So that is how we define an event
(Refer Slide Time: 13:20)
Let us look at examples. Again, when I have an order of finish in a race with 6 students. Let
me go back, and define the events in a similar way. I have A finishes the race, which is
ABCDEF. B comes second in the race is ABDCEF. Now if I am looking at events where A
comes first, and B comes second.
Then I am looking at all possible arrangements where A is in my first place, B is in my second
place, and the rest of the elements are arrangements of C, D, E, and F which can happen in 4!
ways, because I am fixing A and B to be in my first and second space. And I am looking at all
other possible arrangements of C, D, E, F among themselves. So, this is an event where A
comes first, and B comes second.
Notice that this element CBADEF will not be an outcome in the set. Similarly, AFEDBC which
was an event will not be an element of the (
2 ), because this is not an element of 
2 , and
this is not an element of 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:47)
Now, let us toss two coins and note the outcomes. Again, let head on the first toss, head on the
second toss, head on both the tosses would just be the event heads {HH}, which you can see is
2 ), would represent the event that head appears in both the tosses.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:12)
So, now suppose I go back here, and I define here that let S be my sample space again. And let
me define an event 
 which is head in my first toss and 
2 to be head in second toss, or I can
define my 
2 to be tail in my first toss. Now, I know that, this event 
1 an 
2 cannot happen
at the same time because if I have a head in my first toss, I cannot have a tail. If I have a head
in my first toss, I know that I cannot have a tail also in my first toss. So, there are events where
which cannot occur together.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:30)
Similarly, when I have an answer to a multiple-choice question, and my sample space is one
of these answers, or one of these guesses. I cannot have an event which would say A and B are
correct answers, where only exactly one of the answers are correct to my multiple-choice
questions with 4 options. So, an event without any outcome is called a null event, and you can
determine or designate it by this alphabet or by this symbol 
So, if the intersection of (
)is a null event, then we say 
 and F are disjoint events, or
mutually exclusive events. For example, I have just toss a coin once, and I have head or tail. I
can define my event 
 to be the outcome of a head, I can define my event 
 to be outcome of
a tail, I can see that (
)is my disjoint set.
In other words, I can say the outcome head and tail are mutually exclusive that if I get a head,
I cannot get a tail, if I get a tail, I do not get a head. So, these are mutually exclusive events.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:02)
So, suppose I am guessing an answer to a four option multiple choice question. If 
1 is {
is {
3 which is (
2 ), is a null set, (
2 ), are mutually exclusive. If A that is
occurrence of an event disallows the occurrence of 
2 . So, if my guess is A or B. If my guess
is A then B cannot be my guess. If my guess is B then A cannot be my guess. So, these are
mutually exclusive events. Again, a concept that is very-very important for us to understand
about probability of events.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:52)
The next set operation which we are going to talk about is, what we refer to as a compliment
of a set. So, I have my sample space. Again, I have {
}. I toss a coin once. I know this is my
sample space. If I define 
 to be the outcome of a head, I know the complement of E is (
set, which is {
}. I can refer to this as 
 , complement of a set.
Similarly, what is the 
 ? It consists of all those outcomes that are not in 
. So again, I toss a
coin twice, and it define, I know S is {
}. If I define an event that at least one
of the coin is a head, then I know these events are {
} are the outcomes in this event
. So, the 
 is {
}, that is this element which is not in E, and I can see that this corresponds to
both the coins are tail.
Now, this is at least one coin is a head. So, the complement of 
 is both the coins are tail. So,
you can see that this is a very important operation again, and how we have represented this
operation also. So now let us go back, and look at our example.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:46)
So, I toss a coin once, and note the outcomes. I know that 
 is 
 . Toss a coin twice, event is
head on the first toss, event 2 is tail on the first toss and 
 is {
}. One thing we need to
observe is the complement of the sample space is the null set. This is again, or the null event.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:22)
So, now suppose we are given 2 events. Again, remember events are subsets of my sample
space, where sample space in itself is a set of all basic outcomes; all possible basic outcomes
of my random experiment. So, if all the outcomes in 
 are also in my event 
, then I say 
contained in 
, and I denote it by 
Suppose, I again go back, I toss a coin twice. I know {
} are my outcomes of
the sample space. Let me define an event which is head in my first toss. So, the event of head
in my first toss is {
}. This is my event of my head in my first toss. Let me define or
event 
 is my head in the first toss. Let me define 
 to be the event, head in the both coins, or
head in both tosses. I am tossing 2 coins, so head in both toss, head in first toss of, first coin,
head in both toss of the coin. Then I know 
 is {
}. So, the outcomes in 
, what is the
outcome, I have only one outcome {
}. It is also in 
Then I know that, I can say, 
. In terms of event, I know that head occurring in both the
coins is a subset event of the event, where I am saying head is occurring in my first coin. So,
head occurring in the first coin can happen in the outcome {
}, and head in both toss is
a subset of this event. Now, these notions would become very important when we want to
actually derive probabilities of the events.
