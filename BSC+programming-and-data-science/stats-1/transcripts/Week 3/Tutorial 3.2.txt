This is our second question. This is about a small survey about the data regarding annual fees by
some 30 students in 1000s of rupees. So, this will be 20,000 rupees, this will be 40,000 rupees and
this would be 1 lakh. Anyway so we are being asked about the correct representation of the survey.
There are 4 bar graphs given. We just need to check the counts and which bar graph is representing
it properly.
So, let us start with the 20s. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, there are seven 20s. So, the only options which
satisfy this, actually 3 option satisfy it. The option 2, this is definitely wrong because here this is
6 which is wrong and then let us look at 40. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So, which bar graph is giving us 5 for
40? Both a and d, whereas, this is wrong because it is giving 4 which is wrong.
Now, let us look at the 60s, here is 1, 2, 3 and a 4. So, there are four 60s over here. So, certainly a
is also wrong because it gives us only 3. So, this is also wrong. So, d must be the answer. Let us
just now verify it. 80; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Are there six 80s? Yes, there are six 80s. We already
know that these are all correct and 100s; 1, 2, 3 and 4. So, there are four 100s and yes that is correct.
There are four 100s.
And then let us look at 120, 120 there is 1, 2, 3. Three 120s which is also given correct and lastly
there is only one 140 which is also represented correctly. So, our correct option is d.
