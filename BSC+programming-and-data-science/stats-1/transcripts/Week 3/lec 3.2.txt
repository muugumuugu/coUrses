Describing Numerical Data 
 Mean
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
The next thing which we are going to discuss is how do we summarize data using
numerical summaries. When we talked about the categorical variable, we introduce two
descriptive measures; namely, the mode and the median. While mode was used both for
nominal and ordinal type of data. We saw that if you want to summarize the data using
median, it has to be a ordinal data or there should be some sense of order in the data.
So, now what we are going to look at is what are the ways we can describe numerical data.
So, the objective here is to actually develop measures or summaries of data which can be
used to summarize a complete data set.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:07)
So, the most commonly used, so especially when we are dealing with numerical data the
most commonly used descriptive measures again can be broadly categorized into two
categories and these categories are one which are known as measures of central tendency
and the second which are known as measures of dispersion.
Now, what do we mean by measures of central tendency? Measures of central tendency as
the name suggests, it talks about where the data is actually concentrated or what is the most
typical value of a data set. A measure of central tendency describes or tells us what can we
expect as a typical value of a data set; whereas, the measure of dispersion also referred to
as measures of variation or measures or spread talk about the variability in a data set or
spread in a data set.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:15)
So, we will go through these measures in detail. When we talk about measures of central
tendency, the most common measure of central tendency is what we refer to as the mean
of a data set.
What is a mean? I define the mean of a data set to be the sum of the observations divided
by the number of observations. So, now, let us formally define what it is. Suppose, I have
1 , 
2 , 
3 , I refer to my observations as 
1 , 
2 , 
3 ,. For example, I have my data which is
4, 3, 1, 2 and 5. I have 
 equal to 5 here. My 
1 is 4; 
2 is 3; 
_3 is 1; 
_4 is 2 and 
_5 is
So, in general, if I have 
 observations each 
_1 refers to the first observation in my data
set; 
_2 refers to the second observation in my data set and 
 refers to the 
observation in my data set. The mean of a data set is the sum of these observations, the
numerator gives me the sum of these observations which is nothing but 
1 + 
2 + 
 divided by the total number of observations which is 
, small 
Now, recall in when we introduce the notion of a sample and population, we said that a
small 
 refers to what we call the sample size; whereas, capital 
 refers to a population
size. So, if I am having a data set which is a sample, then I do denote it or my notation is
going to be small 
; when I have population, when I refer to it as a population, it is going
to be capital 
So, if my I can define a sample mean, when I have a sample data set to be the sum of the
sample observations divided by the total number of observations, the way we have done
here.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:46)
I can also define a population mean which is typically refer to by the Greek alphabet 
1 + 
 ; whereas, again remember, I said 
 is the total number of observations
in a population divided by capital 
 which is the total number of observations.
The definitions are the same, only thing the number of observations differ whether you are
referring to a sample or whether you are referring to a population. The mean is also
popularly refer to as a average. So, now, let us compute the mean for small data sets.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:26)
Now, I have this data set which is given to me. So, the mean for this data set is very simple.
That is 
 is 2 + 12 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 3. This is what I have here and that I can see is
equal to 42, the numerator and which is equal to 6. In other words, 6 is the mean of this
data set. Now, let us look at another data set.
See the only difference between the first data set and the second data set is in 
2 or the
second observation, everything else is the same. So, I compute the mean for this data set,
When I compute the mean for this data set, I find 
 is equal to 135 by 7 which is 19.285.
What I want you all to observe very clearly is the difference between this data set and this
data set is only the second number; but the mean difference is very high.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:52)
Now, let us look at another data set which is the following, where I the it has only 6
observations now, it does not have the last observation. The mean for this data set is going
to be 21.33. We see that these two means are fairly close to each other; whereas, these two
means are very different from each other.
So, what this tells us is the mean even though here I have only one observation which is
different. This observation and this observation are very different from each other. So, the
mean is very sensitive to outliers. By outliers, I mean what is the number which is very
different from what the typical data set behaves like.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:48)
So, now let us go back to another example. These are the marks obtained by 10 students
in an exam. So, now, I can see that the sample mean in this case is 590 divided by 10
which is 59.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:07)
So, this is the data I have. So, these are the 10 data sets. This is the data which I have,
which I have just given to you 68, 79; this is the data which we have worked with. So, in
this data, you can see that this sum 
2 to 
11 is nothing but the sum which I have worked
here.
So, the sum of this is the numerator sum which is equal to 590. I have a 590 here which
is the sum of all my data values and you can see the mean, the google sheet the mean gives
me what is 
12 by 10 that is what is 590 divided by the total number of observations.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:06)
That is what the mean gives you. Now, you can see that the google sheet has average
demand, command is giving me the same average as what I have obtained before. So,
average command in the google sheet gives me the mean which we have different ok. The
next thing which we are going to see is how do I obtain the mean for a grouped data.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:36)
Now, if I have single. So, now, let us go back to this data which we have seen earlier which
was the response from 15 individuals, we have already seen that this is the frequency 1
appears twice; 2 appears thrice; 3 appears five times; 4 appears four times and 5 appears
once, this is what we have already seen.
Now, for a data of this kind how do I compute the average? Now, 1 appears two times, so
it appears with the frequency 2. So, the way I need to add 1 2 times. So, it is 2 
 1 so 1 +
1 which is giving me a 2. Similarly, 2 appears 3 times. So, the total sum of 2 is going to
be 2 + 2 + 2 or 2 
 3 which is equal to 6. 3 appears five times, so the sum 3 contributes
to its 3 
 5 which is 15; 4 into 4 which is 16 and 5 into 1 is 15.
So, instead of writing 2 + 1 + 3 + all of it, I can write it as 1 appears two times which
contributes to 2; 2 appears three times which contributes six and this is the numerator
which is 
 divided by your 
 or 
 which is equal to 
. This gives me the 
 when
I have discrete single value data.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:31)
So, the mean here is going to be 44 divided by 15 which is equal to 2.93.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:55)
Now, if I go back and type in the same data in a particular sheet and I go back and type in
the same data in a particular sheet, I add a sheet, I just type in this data. So, the data is
1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5.
just
going
type
data.
2, 1, 3, 4, 5. 2, 3, 3, 3, 4; 2, 3, 3, 3, 4 4, 1, 2, 3, 4; 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. I can see that there are 15
values, I just write down the average of this data set which you can see is equal to 2.93
and this is precisely what we had got in our earlier.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:01)
Now, what how do we compute the mean for group data or continuous data? Now, again
recall this when I have continuous data, I do not have a particular value of the discrete data
that is being taken. So, in this case recall we have what is called the midpoint of the data
set or for each class interval. For example, the midpoint of the class interval 30 to 40 is
35; 40 to 50 is 45; 50 to 60 is 55. So, you look at the midpoint rather than looking at each
discrete value, I know the frequency of the data set.
Now, I multiply this frequency with the midpoint, I get 105 and 6 into 45 is 270. My
numerator is going to be 105 plus 270 plus 170 divided by the total number is again 50.
So, it is 2940 divided by 50 which is 58.8.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:11)
A word of caution here is this 58.8 is not the actual mean because we are approximating
it only with the midpoint, I am now taking the actual values of the data. I repeat this 58.8
is an approximation because I am multiplying the frequency with the midpoint or the best
representative in this class interval which is 35. I know my data lies between 30 to 40. So,
I am just saying that ok, it is around 35. So, this 35 is an approximation.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:04)
So, because we are not looking at the exact data values, this average is only an
approximation and not the exact value of the mean; whereas, when we looked at the
discrete single value data, I took the exact value of my data and hence, my mean matched
with the exact average.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:24)
This is a point to be noted. Now, how sensitive is the mean if I add a constant to every
observation. Now, why are we even interested in knowing about this? For example, let us
look at a case where a teacher has already given the marks to the students that is I have
marks of 10 students. Now, I become benevolent, suddenly and I decide to add 5 marks
to each of the students.
So, this is the earlier data set which was 68 had a mean of 59. Now, I am adding 5 marks
to each of these students. So, now, the data set becomes 68 +5 which is 73; 79 + 5 which
is 84 and so forth 66 + 5 which is 71. The number of observations remain the same, but I
am adding a constant that is I am adding 5 to each value in my data set ok. So, what
happens to the mean?
So, earlier my 
1 , 
2 , 
 were 68, 78, 
3 was 38, my 
10 was 66. I am going to add 
1 is
become 73, 68 +5; 
2 is 84 again 78 + 5; 
3 is 43, 38 +5; 
10 is 71. So, by my definition,
if I define what is 
 is going to be a
 is going to be
. This is what our definitions
say.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:35)
So, if I add this and I compute 
1 , I find out the 
1 is going to be
640 640
which is 64. You
can notice that 64 is my 
. This is my 
 which is 5. So, why does this happen? So, I know
that
is my 
; but 
1 is 
1 + 5, 
2 is 
2 + 5, 
3 is 
3 + 5. Similarly, 
10 is
also 
10 + 5. So, you can see that I have 
1 + 
2 + 
3 + 
10 which makes 
 equal to the
following.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:35)
So, I have this which is nothing but
10 +50
because this 5 is added 10 times. Now,
is my 
 that is what we have already seen. 
1 + 
2 + 
3 + 
10 is my 
 that
is something which we have already seen ok.
So, I have this as my 
 50 + 10 is 5, this is the constant. So, I have 
 which is equal to
. So, in summary, when I add a constant to every data point what happens is the mean
of the new data set is the old mean plus the same constant.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:42)
So, here what we have done in this is my original data set, I add a constant that is 73 every
data set is a constant. This sum is equal to 640 that 640, is what I have here the and the
mean is 64 which is equal to 59 + 5. So, adding a constant to every point in the data set
is what we have seen so far.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:12)
The next thing is what happens to with the mean, when I multiply each observation of the
data set with a constant. Again, let us look at what. So, my 
1 , 
2 , 
 is my original data
set, I am multiplying it with the constant. Why are we even interested in something of this
kind?
For example, I conduct an examination, where the marks are for 100. I conduct an
examination for 100; but I want to take only 30% of the grade. So, if the marks when it
were for 100 has given me a particular thing, I want to take a particular percentage. So,
this 
 could be a percentage.
So, if recall I go back to the same example here, I decide to scale down each mark by 40%.
In other sense, each mark is multiplied by my 
 here is 0.4. So, you can see that if I multiply
each point 68 
 0.4 is 27.2.
So, that is what I have here. I am multiplying each of my data point with 0.4; 68 
 0.4,
this is 79 
 0.4, this is 66 
 0.4; I multiply each of my data set with 
. Now, let us look
at what is the sum of that data set is 236 giving me an average of
which is equal to
23.6.
Now, you can notice that again, if I go back what is my 
 my 
_2+ 
, but my
1 is equal to 
 which times 
1 + 
2 + 
This constant is constant for every observation. So, I can remove that constant outside and
I can just have
. This is 
 ; hence, 
 is 
 ok. So, you can verify my constant
here is 0.4; my 
 was 59, so 
 0.4 
 59 is what I have is 23.6.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:00)
So, what we have learned when we studied about mean is we first looked at what is a
definition of a mean, mean is one of the most commonly used summaries of data. We
defined what was a sample mean and a population mean. But further, most of the course
we are going to only deal with sample mean definition.
We saw how to compute the sample mean for discrete ungrouped data and then, we looked
at how to compute the sample mean for grouped data, then we saw what would happen
when we manipulate data by adding a constant to each data point and by multiplying each
data point with a constant. That is what we have seen so far.
