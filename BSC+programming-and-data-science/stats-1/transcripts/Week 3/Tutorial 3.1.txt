Hello statistics students. In this tutorial we want to solve problems based on topics related to week
3. These are the topics, let us look at our first question now.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:28)
This is our question number 1. A traffic policeman records the speeds of vehicles on a busy road
with a 40 
 speed limit. The histogram of this data is shown here, this is the histogram of
speeds of cars and this is actual speed. So these are the number of vehicles in that class of speeds.
So we have 10 to 20, so there are 4 vehicles which went from 10. So we are looking at lesser than,
sorry greater than or equal to 10 but lesser than 20. So the left side is what we take as the included
boundary. So here let us estimate the average speed of the vehicles.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:33)
For this we are going to use a midpoint of each class, so for this class it is going to be 15, for this
one it is going to be 25, for this one it is going to be 35, it is 45, this is 55 and this is 65. And now
how many are there; 4 for the first class, so we are going to do 4 
 15 plus, this is between 6 and
8, so this must be 7, 7 
 25 plus, this is 5, we have 5 
 35 plus this is 3, so 3 
45 plus 6, so 6 
and last one, this is 5. So 5 
 65.
 15] + [7 
 25] + [5 
 35] + [3 
 45] + [6 
 55] + [5 
 65].This is the total calculation we
are supposed to be doing.
Taking 5 common out of this stuff, we can write this as
5([4 
 3] + [7 
 5] + [5 
 7] + [3 
 9] + [6 
 11] + [5 
 13]).
have
slightly
more
manageable numbers, so we will get 5(12 + 35 + 35 + 27 + 66 + 65). So let us sum these up, we
will get this is equal to 5 times 35 + 35 =70, 70 + 12 = 82, 82 + 27 = 109, 109 + 66 = 175 175 +
65 = 240, 5[240] = 1200. So this is the sum of observations, so all of these put together I will get
1200 divided by, now what is the total number of observations here, that would be these numbers,
right? 4 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 6 + 5. 4 + 7 = 11, 11 + 5 = 16, 16+3=19, 19+6 = 25, 25+5= 30.
So we are getting
1200
and this can get cancelled off to give us 40, so we have 40 
 is the
average, which incidentally is also the speed limit given for these vehicles. So the average is at
this speed limit, so the number of them which have crossed the speed limit and that is what the
next question is, calculate the number of vehicles that were exceeding the speed limit by at least
So that would be from 50. So we have interested in the number for this class and this class, which
as we can see is 6 and 5, so we get 11, so 11 vehicles. For the last part, we have calculate the
number of vehicles having speed greater than or equal to 20 
 but less than the speed limit.
So that would be this and this, this, this, both of these are lesser than 40 but greater than or equal
to 20, that gives us 7 + 5 again, so this is then 12 vehicles.
