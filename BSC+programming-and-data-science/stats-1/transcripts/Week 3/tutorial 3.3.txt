Now third question, there is a stem-and-leaf plot that is shown here. And this is about the
attendance of a particular class. There is also a key provider, which shows that 1|4is essentially 14
students. So, if this is 1 and this is 4, that would imply 14 students on a particular day, they are
asking us the average attendance. That would imply we have to do the sum of all the attendances
and let us look at the ones first. So, we have 11 and a 12 and a 14, thus we have
11 + 12 + 14+. ...
For the 20s we have 25, 26 and 27. So, 20 + 25 + 26 + 27. Then further on for the 30s we have
31, 32, 33, 37 and 38. So, we have plus 31 + 32 + 33 + 37 + 38 and the 40s we have 40, 41, 43
and 45. So, that would be plus 40 + 41 + 43 + 45. And lastly, we have a 52, so plus 52. The total
sum of this we will have to calculate and that is going to be
11 + 12 = 23,
23 + 14 = 37,
37 + 20 = 57,
57 + 25 = 82,
82 + 26 = 108,
108 + 27 =
135,135 + 31 = 166, 166 + 32 = 198, 198 + 33 = 231, 231 + 37 = 268, 268 + 38 = 306, 306 +
40 = 346, 346 + 41 = 387, 387 + 43 = 430, 430 + 45 =, 475 + 52 = 527.
Now, we also have to find out how many days have the attendance has been calculated for. So, in
the 10s there are 3, in the 20s there are 4, in the 30s there are 5, in the 40s there are 4 again, in the
50s there is only 1. So, a total of 3 + 4 = 7,7 + 5 = 12, 12 + 4 = 16, 16 + 1 = 17. So, totally over
17 days. So, our mean would be
. So, seventeen 1s and seventeen 3s gives us 51 which is also a
remainder of 17, so 31. So, the mean is 31 students a day.
