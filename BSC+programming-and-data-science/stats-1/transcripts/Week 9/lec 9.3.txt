Random variables - Discrete and continuous random variable
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, in the last lecture, we understood what was a, we defined what was a random variable. So,
now we are going to look at, and towards the end of last lecture, we defined what was a discrete
and continuous random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:35)
So, we will spend some time to understand more about what is a discrete and continuous
random variable. So, these were the definitions which we check, which we gave in the last
session, which was we define the discrete random variable as a random variable that can take
on at most a countable number of possible values. Whereas we said a continuous random
variable is it cannot be counted, or it is infinitely divisible. Now, let us understand what is a
discrete random variable and a continuous random variable through a example.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:25)
So, instead of going and understanding a definition, I can also say a discrete random variable
is a random variable that can take possible values that are discrete points, I am again,
emphasising that are discrete points. So, if I have my real number line here, so I have a 0 here,
I have a 1 here, I have a 2 here, it could take a 
1, it could take a 
2. So, these are isolated
discrete points along the real number line. I repeat, a discrete random variable is a random
variable that can take possible values, along a real number line that are discrete points, the key
idea is they are discrete points.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:22)
So, typically, when we talk about discrete random variables, you involve the operation of
counting number of heads, you are counting.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:38)
Whereas a continuous random variable is the random variable that has possible values. So, if I
again go back to my real number line, it will not take. So, I have it will not take isolated discrete
values, but it would take values that might form an interval along the real number line, can it
be this interval, it could be, it could be 
3 to +4, it could be, but it takes the values in an
interval.
A more rigorous definition of what is a continuous random variable would be offered in
advanced courses. But at this point of time, you need to understand a discrete random variable,
will take discrete points along a real number line, whereas a continuous random variable would
take values in an interval along a real number.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:41)
So typically, a continuous random variable would involve a measurement or something
whereas a discrete random variable involves a counting.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:55)
So, now let us motivate and understand this through an example. Let us look at an apartment
complex. So, what is this apartment complex? In apartment complex there are 4 floors in an
apartment complex. Each floor has 3 apartments. So, if I am looking at this apartment complex,
each floor has a 3 apartments in so it has a 1-bedroom apartment, a 2 bedroom apartment and
a 3 bedroom apartment.
So, there are totally 12 apartments. There are 4 floors, there are 3 houses per floor. And in these
3 houses or 3 apartments. First is a 1 bedroom I have a 2 bedroom and a 3 bedroom apartment.
This is how this apartment complex has been structured.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:51)
So, let us look at the data which is summarised in the following table. So, if you look at the
data, I have 12 apartments that is given by the cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 these are
my 12 apartments. So, you see the first 3 apartments are in the first floor 4, 5, 6 are in second
floor 7, 8, 9 are in third floor and 10, 11, 12 are in fourth floor. When you look at the number
of bedrooms, the first apartment, fourth apartment, seventh and tenth have 1 bedroom each.
The second, fifth, eighth and eleventh have 2 bedrooms each. Whereas the third, 6, 9 and 12
have 3 bedrooms each. So, this is the data I have collected. Now, even though typically you
might expect the sizes of apartments to be the same, but there is some error and I am allowing
I am correct, computing the sizes of the apartment, correct to 2 decimal points in square feet.
So, the first apartment is 900.23 
., the fourth is 900.48, the seventh is 900.53 
So, all the measurement of the sizes of the apartment in 
 for each of the apartment is
given. In addition, we also are capturing how many metres from the left is each one of the
apartment. This is just fictious data, this is just data from an apartment complex. And we are
capturing it in this following way. Now, I can look at this as a random experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:52)
Now, what is the random experiment in this case? Now, let me define the random experiment
is I am randomly selecting an apartment from these 12 apartments, I am selecting one apartment
from these 12 apartments. So, the sample space of my random experiment is any one of the 12
apartments. So, the outcome is I could either have selected the first or the second or the third,
so forth up to the 12th.
So, this constitutes the sample space of my experiment. The outcomes is one, one represents
the first apartment, two represents second, third and so forth, 12 represents the twelfth
apartment. Now, recall when we talked about a random variable, we said that a random variable
associates some quantity with every outcome of the sample space.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:05)
Now, suppose I am asking the following questions. Let a random variable be the number of
bedrooms. So, let us go back to our data, I can see that the random variable that is associated
with my first outcome is 1, the random variable that is associated with the second is 2, third is
3, fourth is again 1, fifth is 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:38)
So, if I am looking at random variables associated with each outcome, I have a 1, 2, 3; a 1, 2,
3; a 1, 2, 3; a 1, 2, 3. These are the random variables. Where what is the random variable? The
random variable 
 is the number of bedrooms in the apartment. And I see that this random
variable, every outcome of my sample space has a random variable or a quantity associated
with it. What are the possible values this random variable can take now? It can take the possible
values the random variable can take are 1, 2, and 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:30)
So, you can see that the possible values the random variable can take are 1, 2, and 3. Now, let
us go to the second question. The second question says that let the random variable be the floor
number of the apartment. Now, again let us go back to our data. The first for with the first
apartment. I know that the floor number associated with my first number is 1 with a second
apartment is 1, third is 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:07)
So, in terms of my sample space, when I come back here, and I am defining say 
 to be the
number of the floor or the floor number with 1 I am associating variable 1 with 2 again 1 with
3 again 1, 4 it is a 2, 5 it is a 2, 6 is a 2, 7 is a 3, 8 is a 3, 9 is a 3, 10 is a 4, 11 is a 4, and 12 is
a 4. So, the possible values the random variable, which is the floor number, every outcome is
associated with a quantity, the possible values, this random variable can take are 1, 2, 3 and 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:02)
So, now you can see that the possible values this random variable can take are 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Now, let me define the random variable to be the size of the apartment. Earlier, we looked at
number of bedrooms, then we looked at the floor number, now I am looking at the size of the
apartment. Again, let us go back.
Now, when we go back to the data and look at the size of the apartment, we do not see, with
that it can be mapped to discrete points on the real number line. Whereas here I could have, so
in the first case, I could map it to 1, 2, and 3, these are discrete isolated points. In the second
case, it is 1, 2, 3, 4.
Whereas in the third case, when I talk about a real number line, I see that I can have that the
data can take any value between 900 square feet to say 1780 or 1800 square feet. So, in a sense,
I can give the values that possible values, the size of the apartment can take, the possible value,
the size can be in an interval, and this interval is 900 to 1800 square feet.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:35)
Now, let us define the fourth random variable to be the distance of the apartment from the left.
Again, we go back to our data, when we go back to our data, we see that again here there are
not discrete points, but it is again a continuum. And when you look at a continuum, I can again
write that the distance of the apartment from the feet.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:01)
So here, if I define this random variable in the earlier case, the size to be some 
, I know that
this random variable 
 would belong to 900 to 1800 square feet. Now, I could call this say 
and I know that this belongs to 324 to 505 metres. So, we have seen the example of a random
variable here, which takes values 1, 2, 3 here it takes the values 1, 2, 3, 4, here it belongs to a
interval and in the last case, it also belongs to a interval.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:05)
So, going back to the definition, which we proposed is of definition the understanding which
we proposed for a random variable, the discrete and continuous, we said a discrete random
variable typically would take discrete points along the real number line, and here it forms an
interval, I can now classify the 2 random, the 4 random variables which we have given as
examples here as the first 2 that is the discrete random variables in the data are nothing but the
number of bedrooms and floor number, whereas the continuous random variables in my
example data set, the apartment data set are size of the apartment, and distance of the apartment
to the left.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:48)
So, let us look at a few more examples where we naturally come across discrete random
variables. Again, remember discrete random variables involves counting. So, whenever you
are having instances where for example, you count the number of people in a household, a
number of languages a person can speak, number of times a person takes a particular test before
qualifying or before passing, number of accidents that happen in an intersection, number of
spelling mistakes in a report all these count, you can see that everything represents the operation
of counting, you can discuss or you can think of this as a discrete random variable.
Whereas the instances where I have, I am computing or measuring the temperature of a person,
measuring the height of a person, measuring the speed of a vehicle, or measuring the time taken
by a person to write an exam, time taken by a person to reach office. All these instances which
involve the measure of a quantity, I can think of the variable or the random variable that is
involved as a continuous random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:16)
So, in summary, what we have learnt in this section was, we first defined formally what was a
discrete random variable and a continuous random variable, a discrete random variable takes
countable values, and it can be mapped onto discrete points on a real number line. Whereas, a
continuous variable, it actually can be mapped on to an interval on a real number line. For now,
we are going to focus on discrete random variables.
