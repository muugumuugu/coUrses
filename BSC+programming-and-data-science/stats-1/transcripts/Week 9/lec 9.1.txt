Discrete Random Variable
In this week, we are going to learn about the important concept of a Random Variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:22)
So, what we have learned so far is we have heard learned about what we call a Random
Experiment. After a random experiment, we defined what was a sample space. A sample space is
what we defined as a set of all outcomes of this random experiment. Then we define the notion
of an event, which is a subset of a sample space. And then we define probabilities of the event.
When we define probabilities of an event, we approach that through the axiomatic approach to
define probabilities. Now, what are we going to do after this then we introduce the notion of
conditional probability we introduced what was based here. But basically what we have done is
we have started introducing this entire framework of probability through the notion of random
experiment and sample space.
So, by now, all of you should be really comfortable in computing probabilities of events. To help
you compute the probabilities of events. We also introduced you to permutations and
combinations. So today, and the next 2 weeks, we are going to focus on the following. So, we are
going to learn about random variables.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:00)
In particular, after the end of these 2 weeks, you should be able to know what is a random
variable. And then you are going you need to understand what is a discrete random variable,
what is a continuous random variable. When you are talking about discrete random variable,
which is going to be the focus of the first 2 weeks, we will be introducing notions of a
probability mass function, how the graph of a probability mass function would look and then
afterwards, we'll also introduce the notion of a cumulative distribution function.
Now, when we talk about both the probability mass functions and accumulator distribution
functions, we are going to give a lot of examples, which might be very useful. Finally, we are
going to introduce important concepts, namely the expectation and variance of random variables.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:01)
And we are going to see how we can apply this in our day to day lives. So, we begin with the
notion of a random variable. So, what is the notion of a random variable? Let us start by
revisiting a random experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:19)
So, recall when we talk about a random experiment, for example, when a toss a coin, I have a
random experiment, the sample space is head and tail. When I roll a die once I can have any 1 of
these outcomes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, any 1 of these 6 outcomes can happen. So, we say that every
time I can use the notion of a sample space to describe the outcomes of the experiment, but many
time I might not be just interested in knowing about the outcome of a experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:59)
When a random experiment or a probability experiment is performed. We are not interested in
the actual outcome. But we might be interested in the value of some numerical quantity
determined by the result, I repeat, we might not be interested in the outcome itself, but we might
be interested in the value of some numerical quantity that is determined by the result. What do
we mean by this for example, when I roll a dice twice, I know there are 36 possible outcomes.
For example, I could have a 1 in my first toss, I could have 1 in my second toss. I could have 1 in
my first toss a 2 in the second toss. I could have a 1 in a first toss and a 6 in the second toss. I
notice that my sample space would have 36 such outcomes. This is something which we have
already seen in our earlier lessons. But suppose I do not care about the individual outcomes, but I
am interested only in the sum of the outcomes.
So, what is the numerical value or quantity I am associating and associating, and I am only
bothered about the some of the outcomes.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:33)
In this case, for example, I am not concerned, I am only bothered about whether the sum of
outcome is 7. But I am really not concerned about whether that 7 has arisen because of outcome
1, 6, or 2, 5, or 3, 4, or 4, 3, or 5, 2, or 6, 1. I am not concerned about it, but I am interested in
knowing that the sum is 7. Now, whenever I am talking about such a numerical quantity, these
numerical quantities of interest, more formally, they are actually functions defined on the sample
space, I am not going into the mathematical rigor of defining such functions.
In advanced courses, you will be subjected to the mathematical rigor. But what I want you to
understand this with every outcome of the sample space, I am associating a quantity, a numerical
quantity. So, this quantity of interest is what I refer to as a random variable. Since these random
variables are, again, the values of the random variables are determined by the outcome of a
random experiment.
And I can actually assign values to these outcomes of the random experiment, I can assign
probabilities to the possible values of the random variable. So, let us look at an example to
understand what we mean by numerical quantities.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:19)
Let us revisit the experiment of rolling dice twice. So, when I roll a dice, twice, that is I have a 6
sided die. And I am rolling it twice. You already seen, I could have 36 possible outcomes. And
those 36 possible outcomes are listed in the form of my sample space, which is given here I have
s, I have 36 possible outcomes, it could be a (1, 1), (1, 2), up to (6, 6), by (i, j) I mean, i in the
first toss, or the first roll of the dice, and j is outcome of the second roll of the dice. So, I am
throwing a dice twice on my rolling a dice twice. So, this is something which you have already
seen, we have defined events on this.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:21)
Now suppose I am asking two questions. So, I am asking the questions out of out of these
outcomes, how many outcomes do we have we have 36 outcomes? How many outcomes will
result in a sum of 7? Notice I am just interested in the final value of 7. I am not interested in the
individual outcomes as such. The other question I am interested in knowing is how many
outcomes will have the smaller of the outcomes as 3.
What do I mean by smaller of the outcome, if I have an outcome (1, 5), the smaller of these
outcomes is 1, whereas and (4, 3), the smaller of the outcome is 3. And for convenience, if it is
(3, 3), I am going to take it as 3, both the outcomes are the same, we say the smaller of the
outcome is itself. So, these two are the questions I am interested in answering. So, how do we
answer these 2 questions?
So, these questions, I notice the experiment is the same, the sample space is the same. The
questions are actually based on the outcomes and associating some numerical quantity. 1 is the
sum of outcomes. And 1 is what is the smaller of outcomes. So, it is important for us to notice
that the random experiment and the sample space that I am going to use to answer both these
questions are the same. So, what is the random variable?
(Refer Slide Time: 10:06)
So, now let us start with the same example, let me denote the sum of the 2 roles by X. Let me
denote Y to denote the lesser of the 2 outcomes. So for example, I know this is my sample space,
I have (1, 1), (1, 2), up to (1, 6), and I have up to (6, 6), this is what we have listed earlier. This
was a sample space given here.
So, I am just writing the sample space again here. And I am telling X is denoting the sum of
outcomes. So if I have (1, 1) is my outcome, the value X will take is 2, which is 1 + 1. If I have
(1, 6) is my outcome, the value X would take a 7, which is 1 + 6, the value is (6, 6) is my
outcome, the value X would take is 12, which is 6 + 6. So, X is denoting the sum of outcomes.
Similarly, Y is denoting the lesser of 2 outcomes.
So, what is the lesser of these 2 outcomes. I said, if the outcomes on both the roles are the same,
I am going to take it as itself, the lesser of (1 , 6) is again a 1, the lesser of (6, 6) is a 6, suppose I
had (3 , 4), the value of X would be a 7 and value of Y would be 3. So, this is how we are
defining our X and Y here.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:52)
So, for the entire problem, we can see that these are I have 36 outcomes. For (1 , 1), the value is
2, (1, 2) is 3, 1 + 3 is 4, so 4, 2 + 6 is 8, the minimum of (1, 1) is 1, (1 , 6) is 1, ( 2, 1) is again,
1, (2, 2) is 2. So, you can see that 4 + 1 is a 5, 4 + 2 is a 6, 4 + 6 is a 10. And here you can see
the outcome, 5 + 1 is a 6, minimum of (5, 1) is a 1, so minimum of (5, 6) is a 5, 5 + 6 is 11. 6 + 6
is at 12. And the minimum of (6 , 6) is a 6.
So, you can see that for each 1 of these 36 outcomes of my sample space, I have a value of X,
and I have a value of Y, which is associated with it. Now why what, what, what next. Now, these
outcomes are outcomes of a random experiment. And associated with each one of these
outcomes is the value of X and the value of Y. So, when I have the outcomes, and these values, I
can talk about associating, or I can talk about the following is, can I talk about probability of the
values X taking the values?
Now let us go back here, X is taking a set of values, Y is taking set of values. On closer
inspection, I can see X takes the value 2 takes the value again. Does it take the value 1, it does
not take the value 1, it takes the value 2, it takes the value 3, I have an X taking a value here I
take X again taking a value here, then I have yes, 4 yes, it takes a value 4 here it takes a value 4
here. 5 yes 5, 1. So, you can see that X is taking the value 5 yes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
So, it is taking 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. So, if you look at the values this X is taking, it is taking the
values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. These are the values this X is taking. I can see that X
is taking the value to when the outcome is (1, 1), it is taking the value 3 when the outcome is (1,
2), and it is taking the value when it is (2, 1), it is taking the value 4 when the outcomes are (1,
3), then it is also (2, 2), and it is taking when it is (3, 1). So, this way you can see that it is taking
a particular value, where I have more than I could have only 1 outcome corresponding to the
value as in this case, and in this case, or I could have more than 1 outcomes corresponding to the
value. So, what are the values X is taking?
(Refer Slide Time: 15:32)
X is taking the values, which are which is denoted as the sum, it is taking the value 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. These are the values X is taking. And however defined X, I have defined
X to be the sum of the outcomes of both the throws or both the roles of the dice. Now given this,
now, let us do the following. I see what is the value of X. Now, let me take the value of X to be
2. Now, what is the relevant event, I know X will take the value too, when the outcome is (1, 1).
So, the relevant event that is corresponding to 2 is just the event (1, 1), there is no other way X
can take the value 2.
Now X can take the value 3, if my first outcome is a 1 and second outcome is a 2, first outcome
is a 2 and second outcome is a 1. So, these is again the relevant event, which will give me the
value of X equal to 3. So, if I am going to look at each one of them, I get 2 with the event (1, 1),
3 I have the event which is (1, 2) and (2, 1), 4 I have the event (1, 3), (2, 2) and (3, 1), this the
sum of these outcomes, which I can define as a relevant event will give me the sum of 4, 5, it is
going to be (1,4), (2 , 3), (3 , 2) and (4, 1), and so forth, they keep going.
And then you can see 9, it is going to be (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4) and (6, 3), all of them add up to 9.
For 10, I see the events are going to be (4,6), (5 , 5) and (6 ,4), for 11, it is going to be (5, 6) and
(6, 5), and 12 I see the relevant event is again, just (6, 6). So, what we have done is first we have
associated a value with each of the outcomes. And then I have just nabbed I have seen that the X
takes the value 2 through 12, X takes these values, I have mapped the relevant event for each
value X takes.
Now what is the point of mapping this relevant event? We recall what we said is because these
random variables are defined on my probability sample spaces, what I can actually see and what
we have defined earlier is the following is because the value of a random variable is determined
by the outcome of an experiment; we may assign probabilities to the possible values. Now come
back to the example what are the possible values of the random variable? I see that the possible
values of the random variable are 2 through 12.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:58)
These are the values it can take the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. So, the question is, can
I assign a probability of X taking the value 2. Can I assign the probability of X taking a value 3?
Can I do this for all the values X is taking? That is the question we are asking. To answer this
question we are finding, and we are mapping to each value that X is staking what is the relevant
event? We have already seen how to come up with probabilities of events.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:42)
Once we do this mapping, we can see that the probability of X is the same as a probability of the
relevant event. So, what is the X value of X? I am looking at value of X, X takes the value 2. I
am interested in knowing what is probability X = 2, I know X = 2, is the relevant even test, just
this set, I need to know what is the probability of this set happening. And we know the
probability of this happening is 1/36. This is something which we have already seen in an earlier
discussions.
Similarly, if X takes the value 3, I am interested in knowing what is the probability of X = 3? So,
I know what are the outcomes that give me X = 3. So again, I go back, and I see it is (1, 2), and
(2, 1), these are the, this is the irrelevant event. And I know the probability of this event is 2/36.
So, if I continue in this way, I get probability X = 2 is 1/36. Probability of (
4 is 3/36, probability X = 5 is 4/36.
I can keep continuing it this way. And I can verify that probability X = 9 is 4/36, X = 10 is 3/36.
Probability of X = 11 is 2/36. And probability X = 12 is 1/36. So, what we have established is, I
know that this X, I say X is a random variable, which takes the values 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11, and
12. And I can also assign a probability to the value X, taking a particular value, which I get from
recognizing the probability X taking a particular value, I will find out what is the probability of
the relevant event and I have assigned probabilities to each of the values X takes.
Now let us look at the other. So, I asked two questions. The first question I asked is, what is the
probability of the sum equal to 7? That was a question. So, I am not interested in anything else, I
just need to check whether X takes a value 7, I see that X takes a value 7, I need to know what is
the probability X would take the value 7, I know probability X would take a value 7 is same as
probability (1 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2) and (6, 1), which is same, which would be 6/36.
So, I am not interested in the individual outcomes, but the probability that the sum is equal to 7.
And I know that that happens with a probability of 6/36. So, what we have done is we have
defined what is a random variable, and we have assigned probabilities to that random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:17)
Now on the same sample space, what do we mean by same sample space, I have again, roll 2 die,
I have the same sample space. Now I am going to define Y to be the lesser of the 2 outcomes?
What do we mean by it? If (i, j) is an outcome, if i < j, then Y will take the value i. If i = j Y will
again take the value i, I saw, I can define that Y takes the value i if i
j. So, what are the values
this Y would take?
So for example, if I have (1, 1), the value is 1, Y is equal to 1, (1, 2) the values again equal to 1.
(2, 1), the values again equal to 1, (2, 3) the value would be equal to 2. (2, 2), the value is equal
to 2. So, these are the values that I am associating with each of the outcomes. So, I know that for
each of these 36 outcomes, I can see that again, I can go back here.
So if you go, so we can go back here, you can see here, the value is 1. So Y takes the value 1, the
second value Y takes is 2. So this is where it takes the value 1, 2, it takes the value 3 takes the
value 4, takes the value, 5, and 6. So you can see that on the same sample space, now I am
interested in the value Y takes. So Y takes the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, these are the values this
variable, or this Y takes.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:21)
So, you can see why it takes the values 1 2 3 4 5, and 6. So, I can again repeat what I did for the
earlier case. So, I see Y, with Y takes the value 1, the relevant event is when we would Y take
the value 1, it takes the value 1 when my outcome is either a (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) or all outcomes
in which 1 appears either in the first toss, or in the second toss. So, what are the outcomes in
which 1 appears either in the first toss or second toss. So, I have (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), and
(6, 1). So, these are the outcomes in which 1 appears.
And for these 2 outcomes, Y takes the value 1. So, I can say that Y is taking the value 1, the
relevant event is this following, which is listed all the possible outcomes I have just discussed.
Now, when we take the value 2, Y would take the value 2, when 2 is equal to (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2),
(5, 2), (6, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), and (6, 2). So, you can see that the outcomes were the lesser of
the 2 outcomes is 2, and that you can see is (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)
and (6, 2).
The third thing, when would Y take the value 3, again, I have a (3, 3), I will have a (3, 4), I will
have a (4, 3), I will have a (3, 5), (5, 3), (3, 6), and (6, 3), which I can list in the same way, I have
all these outcomes, where Y takes the value 3. Similarly, for 4, Y takes the value when it is (4,
4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4) and (6, 4). 5 and it is (5, 5), (5, 6) and (6, 5), and Y takes the value 6, only
when the outcome is (6, 6).
So, you can see immediately what you notice is the value Y is taking whereas X was the sum
which took the value 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12. And I obtained what was the probability X =
2, X = 3 up to X = 12. So similarly, here, I have Y, which is taking value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And I
can find out based on what is the relevant event, I can also tell what is probability Y = 1, Y = 2
up to probability Y = 6. I can tell this similarly, like the way we did earlier. So, let us see what
are the probabilities.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:26)
So, I have Y = 1, Y equal to 1, I have this is my relevant event. And I can see there are 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 in the event. And the probability of this event happening is 11/36 so
probability Y = 1 is l1/36. Similarly, the probability with which Y takes the value 2, I have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And all of them are equally likely. So, it is 9/36, probability Y = 3, is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, which will give me a 7/36. Probability Y = 4 is 5/36, Y = 5 is 3/36. And finally,
probability Y = 6 is 1/36.
So, this was an example where we have defined 2 random variables, which are capturing
different numerical quantities on the same sample space, which comes from the same
experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 29:45)
Now let us look at another problem. Let us look at another example. Again, this is an example
which we have seen earlier, and I am tossing a coin 3 times. So, when I toss a coin 3 times I am
observing what is the outcome of each of the tosses, I know the sample space in this is my first
toss I record, what is my first toss, my second toss and my third toss, this is what I am recording.
So, if I look at the outcome, I could have a head, head, head, I could have a head in my first toss,
head in the second toss or tail in my third toss, head in my first toss, tail in my second toss, head
in my third toss, I could also have a head in my first toss, a tail and my second toss, a tail in the
third toss, I could have a tail in my first toss, head in a second toss, tail in my third toss, tail,
head, head; tail, tail, head and tail, tail, tail.
So, you can see that this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are the set of possible outcomes that is I can have a
head in my first head in the second. So, it is basically head appearing in there. So, I have 3
tosses. The first toss could be head or tail. So, there is 2 ways of happening it. Second toss also
could be head or tail. Another 2 ways of happening third toss could also be head and tail, another
2, so 2
2, which is
, which is 8 possible outcomes for this experiment.
(Refer Slide Time: 31:28)
And the sample space for this experiment is hence given by these 8 possible outcomes. Now,
suppose for this experiment, again, I am asking two questions. The first question I am asking is, I
want to know how all of this 3 tosses how many tosses will be heads? In other words, I am
counting the number of heads in each of the tosses. The second question I am asking is, of the 3
tosses, which toss results in a head first, what do I mean by it, is my first toss a head, or the
second toss a head, or the third toss a head.
For example, in this outcome, my first toss is a head. In this outcome, my first toss is a head. In
this outcome, again, the first toss is a head. In this, my first toss is a head. In this, my second, the
head appears for the first time in the second toss, here also the head appears in the for the first
time in the second toss, here, it appears for the first time in the third toss, here, it does not appear
at all.
Now, when I am counting the number of heads, I know I have 3 heads here, I have 2 heads here,
I have 2 heads here, I have 1 head here, I have 2 heads here, I have 1 head here, I have 1 head
here, I have no head here. With a caution and not put a number here because here, I am not
telling it is a zeroth toss because I do not know whether what is a zeroth toss. So I just left for
now I am calling this nil.
So, you can see that on the same sample space and with the same outcomes we have defined 2
random variables or 2 numerical quantities which we seek to answer. Again, observe that the
experiment and the sample space are the same.
(Refer Slide Time: 33:33)
So, now let us define X to be the number of heads that appear. And Y to be that toss in which a
head appears first that is the order of the toss, whether is the first toss, or the second, or the third
toss. Again, as in the previous example, for each outcome, let us find out what is the value of X
and what is the value of Y. So, what do I have here? What are the outcomes I have these 8
outcomes.
In this outcome I know the value of head there are 3 heads, so value of X is 3, and the head is
appearing in the first store. So, the value of Y is 1. Here I have 2 heads, head appears in the first
toss so value of Y is 1, X is 2. Again access to a head appears in the first toss to and 1 head
appears in the first toss and there is only 1 head so both X and Y take the value 1, here head
appears in the second toss, Y takes the value 2 and there are 2 heads.
Here again head appears in the second toss Y value is 2 but there are only 1 head, head appears
in the third toss and there is only 1 head here there are no heads so X takes the value 0, whereas
here, I am writing nil or none because Y does not appear does not appear in any of the tosses so I
am just assigning a value nil. Now this value could be a very high value or not. But what I want
you to see is the Y takes a value corresponding to this, what is the value I need to give to this nil
is something it could be any real value. For now, I want you to understand that these are the
values that Y takes. So, Y and X are defined on the same sample space.
(Refer Slide Time: 35:33)
And for each outcome, I have a value. So, now let us look at the X that is number of heads in the
outcome. So what are the values this X is taking? So again, go back here, you can see that X
takes the value 0 1 2, and 3, so X takes 4 values, and what are the values X is taking? X is taking
the value 0 1 2 and 3. So, now let us look at the relevant events where X takes the value 0, I
know X takes the value 0 means that all the 3 tosses result in a tail. So, the relevant event is TTT.
X takes the value 1 when 2 tosses, so 1 of the tosses is a head. So, I have the first toss, second
toss, third toss. So, the head in the first toss or head in the second toss or head in the third toss.
So, the possible ways it can happen are the following. So, what are the possible events, the
relevant event of X taking the value 1 is HTT, THT or TTH. Similarly, X is taking the value 2.
So I can have my first second and third toss, H can be the first 2 tosses, or the first and the third
toss or the second and the third toss. So, the relevant event is all these 3 outcomes put together,
which is HHT, HTH, and THH.
Similarly, X takes the value 3, if all the 3 tosses result in head, and that can happen only in 1
way. So, the relevant event is again, HHH. So what we have done now is I know x, which is the
number of heads in an outcome that appear is taking the value 0, 1, 2, 3 X takes the value 0, the
relevant event is all my 3 tosses are tails. And for X = 3, the relevant event is all the 3 tosses are
heads, and for 1 and 2, I have listed what are my relevant events?
So, as in the earlier case, I can find out what is the probability of X = 0, X = 1, probability of X =
2 and probability of X = 3, which are nothing but the probability of the relevant events. So, what
is probability of X = 0? Probability of X = 0 is same as probability of this event TTT happening
and I know that that is equal to 1/8, because my sample space has 8 equally likely outcomes.
Similarly, probability of X = 1 is probability of this happening, which is equal to 3/8.
Again, in the assumption of equal likelihood probability of X = 1 is 3/8. What is probability of X
= 2? Again, there are 3 outcomes probability of X = 2 is also 3/8, whereas probability of X =3 is
just 1/8 because there is only 1 outcome that satisfies the condition that X = 3.
So, what we have done here to see that from a sample space of tossing a coin, or an experiment
of tossing a coin 3 times we list down the sample space define the random variable to be the
number of heads we have got, what are the values his head can take, and what is the probability
with which X takes those values. Now for the same sample space, we are interested in knowing
which toss results in a head first. To understand this, let us go back to our earlier table.
So, if you look at this table, you can see that Y takes the values what are the Y values, Y takes
the value 1 2 3 and nil these are the values Y is taking. As again now I am not assigning a
numerical value here, but I could assign a numerical value, I could assign a value 0, but for now I
am just writing nil because Y equal to 0, what physically I can interpret it as the zeroth toss, this
does not make meaning. So, I am just writing that there is no toss corresponding to this outcome
where the first (toss) head appears for the first time. So, you can see that Y takes these 4 values
that is what I can see that Y takes these values,
(Refer Slide Time: 40:56)
And now, again, let us see what when Y takes the value 1, when we take the value 1 again, Y
would take the value 1 is same as first toss is head that is in which toss the head appears first So,
again, I have my first toss, my second toss, my third toss that is 1 2 3 my first toss is a head, then
my second toss could be a head or a tail, tail or a head, head or a head or tail or tail. Is there any
other possibility that can happen other than this?
(Refer Slide Time: 41:41)
So, you can see that if my first toss is a head, the relevant events that could happen as head with
both the tosses falling as a head or head tail head or head tail, tail head or head TT. So, these are
the relevant events. So, now, let us look at Y taking the value 2. So, head Y is denoting the toss
in which head appears first. So, again, I look at this HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, TTH, THT, THT,
THH and TTT. These are my possible outcomes. So, here I have head appearing for the first
time in the first 4 tosses. Now, in this among these 2 tosses, I have head appearing first in the
second toss for these 2,
So, the outcomes that satisfy that head appearing first for the first time and the second toss is
THH and THT. For the third time again, we can see for the third time, it would be only this
outcome, which is TTH, and that outcome, X head appearing for the first time in the third toss is
given by TTH. And then of course, in the nil, which corresponds to this outcome, because head
does not appear at all, and the way head does not appear. So, head appears first does not happen
in this outcome that the head appears first.
So, these are the values that Y takes Y takes values 1, 2, 3 and nil. As earlier, I can also associate
probabilities with the values Y takes, and what would be these probabilities. Again, you can see
that the probability of Y taking the value 1 is equivalent to the probability of this event
happening. Remember, there were 8 outcomes in my sample space, I have a 4/8. Probability of Y
= 2 items, or 2/8, Y = 3 is just 1/8, probability Y equal to nil again, will come back to what is this
nil is again, 1/8. I can represent this nil with any real valued number, which makes sense but for
now, I am just telling that Y takes the value nil.
(Refer Slide Time: 44:25)
Or if you say test the value 0, you should qualify by saying that what do you mean by Y taking
the value 0, by taking the value 0 means that my outcome, the head never appears first in any of
the tosses. So, probability Y = 1 is 4/8, Y = 2 is 2/8, Y = 3 is 1/8 and Y takes the value in nil is
1/8. So, what we have seen in the earlier two examples is given a random experiment and sample
space I am associating some numerical quantity to each outcome and, and using this concept of a
numerical quantity to answer some things about the experiment.
For example, it could be some of the dice or the lesser of the 2 dice or the number of heads that
appear in each outcome or what is a count the number or the order of the outcome for which the
head appears for the first time.
