Discrete Random Variables - Probability Mass Function Properties
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
So, we continue our discussion on discrete random variables. Again recall a discrete random
variable is a random variable that can take on at most a countable number of possible values.
We refer to it as a discrete random variable we are now going to focus only on discrete
random variables. Again when we look at discrete random variables let I denote a random
variable with the upper case 
1 , 
2 , 
3 , 
1 , 
2 , 
3 and so forth or 
1 , 
2 , 
This is typically we represent a random variable through upper case alphabets capitals 
So, now let 
 be a random variable let it take a finite number of values. Now what do I mean
by it takes a finite number of values. It takes n possible values. Let me represent that by
1 , 
2 , 
 . For example, if 
 takes the values 1, 2, 3 my 
1 would have been 1, 
2 would
have been 2, 
3 would have been 3.
 takes the value 1, 2, 3, 4 as in the case of the number of floors. This was the number of
bedrooms, this is the floor, then 
1 is 1, 
2 is 2, 
3 is taking the value 3 and 
4 is 4. So, in
general I can talk of this random variable 
 taking values 
1 , 
2 , 
 that is what I mean by
 is taking n finite values 
1 , 
2 , 
 . Once I know 
1 , 
 takes these values we define the
probability mass function. How do I define it?
This is the function for all the values what are the values 
 is taking 
 is taking values
1 , 
2 , 
 . So, associated with every value 
 takes I know there is a probability associated
with it. So, I have what is a probability of 
 taking the value 
1 I know what is the
probability of 
 taking the value 
2 and 
 taking the value 
 . This function the probability
 equal to 
 for each of these values. This function is referred to as the probability mass
function of the random variable.
A nice way to represent it is in tabular form. So, 
 takes the values 
1 , 
2 , 
3 up to 
 the
probability is with probability 
 equals to 
1 ), 
2 ), 
3 ) up to 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:43)
So, let us look at a very simple example. So, here we assume that this 
 takes finite number
of values so 
 takes 
1 , 
2 , 
 . possible values, but I could also have the case that 
assumes value 
1 , 
2 , 
3 countable, but infinite. Again associated with each of these exercise I
will a 
1 ), I will have a 
2 ), I will have a 
3 ) so forth. So, whenever I talk about the
discrete random variable, I could either have countably finite or countably infinite number of
values.
But nevertheless whatever it is there are two key properties of the probability mass function. I
repeat there are two key properties of the probability mass function. They are namely
 0. In other words 
 ) is always non negative and the second property is that
some probability of 
 is equal to 0 for all values of 
. So, if I represent it in tabular form I
have 
 and the next property is since 
 I know that every point in my sample
space.
For example, if my sample space in the apartment complex was 1, 2 up to 12. Every point
was mapped to a random variable we also know from the axioms of probability the 
) = 1.
Since every point is mapped on to a random variable, it makes sense for us to say that the
summation over all possible values 
 can take the summation of the probabilities should add
up to 1. So, the two key properties are probability of 
 is now negative and the summation of
over all possible values of 
 should be equal to 1.
Now if 
 takes only finitely many values with probability 
1 ), 
 ), then I know
 ) should be equal to 1. Some books refer 
 ) with just 
 , but we need to
understand that whenever you see a 
 this could be probability 
 takes the value 
probability 
 takes a value 
. You need to understand how the probability mass function is
defined, but nevertheless however you are defining the probability mass function the
probability of 
 taking a particular values is always now negative and the sum of probabilities
over all possible value should be equal to 1. These are the key properties of the probability
mass function.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:30)
Now let us look at an example. Suppose 
 is a random variable that takes 3 values. So again I
have a random variable which takes only 3 values it is finite 0, 1, 2 and what is the
probability? 
 = 0) is 4, 
 is equal to 1 is half and 
 equal to 2 is 4. Tabularly I can
represent it as x takes the value 0, 1 and 2 so my 
1 , 
2 , 
1 takes 0, 1, 2 with 
which is a 0 is 4. 
 equal to 
2 which is a probability 
 equal to 1 is
which is 
 equal to 2 is
and 
 equal to 
So, what is the first property I need to see. 
 0. I know 
1 ) is 4 this is greater than 0
2 ) is
which is greater than 0, 
3 ) is
which is also greater than 0. The second
property is 
 ) should be equal to 1. In other words I need to verify whether 
1 ) +
2 ) + 
3 ) = 1. This is what I need to verify. I can see that 
1 ) is 4, 
2 ) is 4 , 
I can verify that this is equal to 1. Hence, what we have here is a probability mass
function of the random variable.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:26)
Let us look at certain more examples to understand the properties of the probability mass
function. Now suppose I have 
 is a random variable that takes values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So I have
this is my 
1 , 
2 , 
3 , 
4 , 
5 . Again it takes finite number of values with the given probabilities.
So, is this a probability mass function? So, the first condition is I need to check 
Yes, for this done this is greater or equal to 0 this greater or equal to 0, this greater or equal to
0 this is also greater or equal to 0. The next condition so the first condition is satisfied.
Now the second condition is I need to check whether 
 ) is equal to 1. So, I have a
0.4 + 0.1 which is a 0.5. 0.5 + 02 which is a 0.7, 0.7 + 0.1 which is a 0.8, 0.8 + 0.3 which is
1.1 so I get the 
 ) is not equal to 1. Hence, this does not satisfy the probability
properties of a probability mass function. Hence, the first table is not a probability mass
function.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:03)
Now, let us look at the second example again 
 is taking the value 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So, the
first property 
 0 here it is yes, yes, yes. This is a no, this is a yes. So, you can see that
4 ) is not greater or equal to 0. However, if you notice 
 ) which is equal to 0.2 +
0.3 + 0.4 - 0.1 + 0.2. You can see that this is 0.9 which is equal to 1. So, I have a situation
where the function satisfies the second property, but not the first property. Hence, because of
this it is not a probability mass function.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:07)
So, here it violates 
 ) =1 over all values of i. Here it violates the 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:26)
Now, let us look at a third example. In this example again 
 takes the value
1 , 
2 , 
3 , 
4 , and 
5 with these probabilities. Again, let me check the first condition greater
or equal to 0, greater or equal to 0, greater than 0, greater or equal to 0, greater or equal to 0.
First condition is satisfied first condition is 
 0 satisfied. Now let us check the second
condition which is 
 ) 0.3 + 0.1 0.4, 0.4 + 0.2 0.6, 0.6 + 0.4 1, 1 + 0 is 1. Yes it is
equal to 1. So, both the conditions are satisfied hence this is a probability mass function.
So, the first thing which we need to understand is given a random variable again I specify we
are looking only at discrete random variables. So, given a random variable 
 that takes the
values 
1 , 
2 , up to 
 . For the first case I considered countably finite number of values if I
am talking about a probability mass function I need the two properties. And what are the two
properties we are looking at when we are talking about a probability mass function?
The first is 
 0 and the second is summation probability of 
 over all possible values
 should be equal to 1. Now, let us look at another example where 
 does not take finite
number of values. It takes countable number of values, but not finite.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:30)
So, let us look at this example. So, what are the values this random variable is taking? 
taking the value 0, 1, 2, 3 it keeps taking these values. Let me write 
 ), probability of
0 or 
1 , 
2 probability of 
3 , probability of 
4 so this is my 
1 , 
2 , 
3 , 
4 so 
 is taking these
values I am not having finite number of values. Now what is it the 
) is given by
Now 
is positive 
 0 because 
 takes the value 0, 1, 2 all of it. So, I want to know for what
value of 
 will this be a probability mass function? Again what are the values 
is taking
takes the value 0, 1, 2, 3 so forth 
 = 0) would be
. This would be
, this should be
and so forth.
So, what value of 
 would make this a probability mass function? So, the first thing is I know
 is positive and 
 is positive. So, 
 has to be greater or equal to 0 because again what are the
conditions? The conditions of 
 ) should be greater or equal to 0 and 
 ) = 1.
For the first condition I need 
 to be non negative because everything else is going to be now
negative. For the second condition I need to check 
= 1. So, what value of 
 would
give this, this is what we need to check because for this to be a probability mass function I
need this condition to be satisfied.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:12)
So, the question is what is the value of 
 for which this is a probability mass function. So, this
 goes from 0 to infinity. This is again 
 goes from 0 to infinity. So I know it is again 0 to
infinity here so 
 goes from 0 to infinity 
 because 
 takes the value 0, 1, 2. I need to look
 goes from 0 to infinity. Now we all know the following that 
 is so we all know the
following that 
 is 
Hence, I have summation 
 because this would be 
 . So, now I have from here
. So, this term is going to be 
 that is what this tells us that 
! is 
 . So, this term
would be 
 . So, I get 
 = 1 which should give me 
 or 
Hence, I get my 
) is
solution that 
) is
. So, I can get my 
 to be 
 which is going to give me the
(Refer Slide Time: 19:22)
Now let us go back to the examples which we have discussed earlier. So, we looked at the
first example we looked at was rolling a dice twice. We know that the sample space has 36
outcomes and I have listed down the 36 outcomes here which are (1, 1) to (6, 6). Now let us
define the random variable which is defined as a sum of outcomes. Again, we have seen this
in the earlier lecture that every outcome is mapped to a particular values.
So, you can see that (1, 1) is mapped to 2; (1, 2) is mapped to 3; (1, 3) is mapped to 4; (6, 6)
is matched to 12; (6, 5) is mapped is 11 the sum of outcomes. So, I can see that this random
variable 
 takes the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. These are the values this
random variable take 
 takes the value 2, (1, 1) is the outcomes which maps to it 
 takes the
value 3 (1, 2) and (2, 1) are the outcomes that give the value 3. (4, 1), (3, 2), (2 , 3), 1 so each
one of them you can see is mapped 12 is from the outcome (6, 6).
Now again associated with each one of these values 
). So, associated what is the
 = 2)? I know only outcome gives this value so it is 36 (1, 2) and (2, 1) here so this is 36,
 equal to 4 comes from (1, 3); (2, 2) and (3, 1) 36, 
 equal to 5 I have (1, 4), I have (2, 3) I
have (3, 2), I have (4, 1). So, it is 36 this should we can check is 36.
 equal to 7 is (1, 6); (2, 5); (3, 4); (4, 3); (5, 1) and (5, 2) and (6, 1) which is
. Similarly,
this would again 8 I know 8 would come from a (6, 2); (5, 3); (4, 4); (3, 5) and a (2, 6). So,
again this is
you can verify for all other values this is going to be my probability mass
function. So, I know 
 takes the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 with the probability
this one.
Now is this a probability mass function? Again what are the properties of the probability
mass function? This should be greater or equal to 0 I can see each one of them is greater or
equal to 0. The second thing we need to verify is the sum of the all probabilities 
 going from
all 
 so this is 
1 , 
2 , 
3 , 
4 , 
5 , 
6 , 
7 , 
8 , 
9 , 
10 and 
 going from 1 to 11 should be
equal to 1. 3 + 3 6, 10, 15, 21, 26, 26 plus again you can see + 10 is 36 so you can see that
this is 36 which is equal to 1 and I can see that this indeed is a probability mass function.
Now let us go to the second random variable which we defined. Again we defined the second
variable which takes the lesser of the values of the outcomes. So, again I have 
 takes the
value 1 for these outcomes. So for all these outcomes 
 takes the values 1, 
 takes the value 2
for these outcomes, it takes the value 3 for these outcomes, it takes the value 4 for these
outcomes, it takes the value 5 for these outcomes and it takes the value 6 for this outcome.
So, this is 36 5, 1, 2, 3 so this is a 36 4 would be 36 for 3 it was 36, 2 it was 36 and 1 11 out of
these outcomes 
). So, I know 
 takes these values with the respective probabilities.
Again is this a probability mass function. Let us verify I know all of them are greater than or
equal to 0. So, the first property is satisfied the second property 11 + 9 20, 20 + 7 27, 32 35,
36. It is actually 36 which is equal to 1. So, I have both the properties are satisfied and hence
this also defines a probability mass function.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:43)
Now let us look at the next example of tossing a coin 3 times. Now when I toss a coin 3 times
again this is my sample space. Again we define 
 to be the random variable that counts the
number of heads in the toss. Again this outcome it is 3 here I have 2, here I have 2, here I
have 1 again 2 I have 1 head, 1 head and no head. So, 
 takes the value 0, 1, 2 and 3 with
what probabilities.
The probability with 
 takes no head it corresponds to this outcome it is 8, 3 heads
corresponds to this outcome which is again 8. One head it corresponds to this, this and this so
it is 8, 2 corresponds to this, this and this outcome which is again 8. Now is this a probability
mass function? All of them are greater or equal to 0 and the sum of the probabilities which is
equal to 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 is
function.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:06)
which is equal to 1. So, hence it is indeed a probability mass
So, the next thing which we can look at is the random variables which counts the toss in
which head appears first. Again, here head appears first in the first toss again here it appears
in the first toss here it again appears first in the first toss, here it appears in the first toss, here
it appears in the second toss this is again second toss, this is third toss and this is the nil toss.
Remember, we defined it as nil we did not define it as 0.
So, the values 
 takes are again 1, 2, 3 and nil and the probability with 
 takes those values.
It takes the value 1, 4 out of 8, 2 out of 8, 3, 1 out of 8 and nil 1 out of 8 all of them are
greater or equal to 0. The second property I need to check whether they add up to 1 which is
which is equal to 1 and I can see that this indeed is again a probability mass function.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:24)
So, by this time what you have to understand is what is the probability mass function. Again
remember we are talking only about a discrete random variable. So, what we are looking at is
we have defined a discrete random variable which can take finite number of values or it can
take countably infinite number of values with 
 ) which is 
1 ), 
2 ), 
Again, same thing when it takes countably infinite number of values 
1 ), 
2 ) say it is a
probability mass function if each of the 
 0 and summation over all possible values of
 should be equal to 1, then it is a probability mass function. So, the next is can I graph this
probability mass function. So, that is what we are going to look next.
