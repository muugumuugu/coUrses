Introduction and Types of data Part 
If you are come up to this module what would I expect you to know is you know what is
data and you know how the data is organized as a data table.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:26)
And when I say it is organized as a data table I mean that you understand that this is the
data where I have columns representing variables and rows representing the cases or
observations.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:39)
Now, once we go back to this, you can see that again let us go back to the data set. The
minute you look at a data set of this kind, you can see that when I look at name it is just
Anjali, Pradeep, Varsha, Divya, I have gender. When I look at gender I have two
categories female and male. When I have marks, you can see that this marks. Let me put
back this mark here, let me put it as say 565 and remove the percentage.
So, when I look at marks, you can see that there is 484, 514, 565 etcetera, but state board
again it is again some sort of a category here. I have a State Board, I have ICSE, I have
CBSE. Marks in class 12 again 394, 437 again the board etcetera.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:35)
Let us go to the other hospital data. Height, again I have centimeter. So, let me rephrase
this into centimeters I put it as 152, 167 and I have a 175 centimeter here, gender again
male female, weight is again you can see 75, 57.5, 65, 98. There is something called
blood group, body temperature in degree Fahrenheit and you have blood pressure.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:12)
So, the minute you look at the data of this kind. Let us look at the cricket data, you again
have a bowling average which is 44.48, 166.25, 64.38 whereas, matches played you have
463, 248, 350. Now, here you have a jersey number which is 10, 18, 7 etcetera. So, the
minute the you look at a data set of this kind two things you observe. The first thing you
observe is you have numbers, you have text. By text I mean that you have names, you
have role of a batsman, all rounder, go back to your blood group you have O plus A
minus, you have gender which is again captured as male and female, you have board
again which is captured as CBSE state board.
So, you immediately see that all data is not of the same kind. You see that there is a basic
difference in the way the data is presented. So, the next thing is we seek whether I can
classify this data into broadly two categories.
Immediately I notice that some data is numerical in nature or quantitative in nature. For
example, I see that the marks and the bowling averages the height, weight, the bowling
average, the highest score, the batting average, the matches played, etcetera can be
clubbed into some kind of variable whereas the name the gender, the board, the blood
group and here the role. These represent certain kind of variables.
Interestingly if you look at this jersey number, it appears to be numbers; but all of us
know that these numbers have no meaning. So, there are kinds of variables which could
take numerical values as in this thing they could be numbers, but they might not.
So, there is definitely a difference between the variable, a jersey number and matches
played even though both are numbers. So, it is very important for us to understand how
to classify data and to what category or what type of data my variable belongs to
extremely important. So, when we look at data, data is broadly classified into two
categories; categorical data and numerical data.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:17)
So, when we look at categorical data, these are also called as qualitative variables. Now,
it identifies group membership. What do we mean by group membership? Again we go
back to our student data, let us look at gender. Gender is a categorical variable. I have
two categories here. I can classify any observation into one of these two categories.
So, it is a group membership. Similarly, when I look at board I have a category which is
a State Board, I have ICSE, I have CBSE. So, again you can see that this categorical
variable has three categories and any observation can be categorized into one of these
three groups.
So, when we go back you can see that you in a sense, I am giving membership of an
observation to a particular group in that particular variable. So, this category has groups.
Let us go to the hospital data. You see that blood group every patient is either an O
positive or an O negative or a B positive or a A positive or A negative.
So, you can see that there are many blood groups I again this is a categorical variable;
gender is a categorical variable. What kind of variable is mobile number? I leave it as an
exercise. I want you people to come up with an answer; mobile numbers are again
numbers. What kind of a variable do you think is a mobile number?
Similarly, what kind of a variable do you think is the jersey number? Even though jersey
number is 10, 18, 7, what kind of a variable is it? Is it a categorical variable or is it a
numerical variable?
So, now, the first thing which we need to understand is I have categorical data I also
have what are numerical data. When we have numerical data, numerical data is also
called quantitative variables. Here I can talk about numerical properties of data.
Now, go back here. Marks obtained both in class 10 and class 12 are numerical data and
you talk about marks this is 484 marks, this is 514 marks, this is 565 marks. Come to the
hospital data I have 178 centimeters, 150 centimeters; weight 75 kilograms, 575 sorry
57.5 kilograms; body temperature in terms of Fahrenheit degree Fahrenheit 100 degree
Fahrenheit, 98.4 degree Fahrenheit. When I come to cricketing data matches played, I
have batting averages, I have wickets taken 154 run score 200 runs.
So, you can see immediately when I talk about numerical data, I have associated with
them either measurement units or I have something which are called the bowling average
and batting average. Now, you also see that when I talk about matches, it is a whole
number it is 463 whereas, when I talk about batting averages you can see that it can take
any value. It could be fractions also or it is any value. So, this again tells us that when we
talk about categorical and numerical data; within numerical data, I could have discrete
data and I could have continuous data. I could further look at data that is discrete and I
could look at data that is continuous right.
So, once we understand what is this categorical and numerical data, we need to
understand the measurement units that are used for numerical data. Again let us go back
to our data, you can see that here height is measured in centimeter, weights is measured
in kilograms, the body temperature in degree Fahrenheit. Again we have marks again this
is 484 marks. Again when you come to players data you have matches played, highest
score; it is in runs wickets taken again in wickets ok.
So, the idea is we need to understand what is the scale that defines the numerical data.
Again we have already emphasized on the point that when you have numerical data
which take units. We need to ensure that the variable is measured across all observations
and shares a common unit. This is something which we need to ensure.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:15)
Apart from categorical data and numerical data, we also have data which where which
are referred to as time series data.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:27)
Let us look at this data. Now, when we look at this data, you can see that this data has a
variable which is called date. And this data is actually the data which tracks at a retail
outlet, what is the quantity that is procured every day from 1st March to 30th March of a
month, the cost of procurement and the price at which it was being sold.
If you look at it the variable is just one thing which is potato and you for all the days you
are tracking what is the quantity that is being sold. So, in other words I have a date; I
have the first march, I have second march, I have third march. I have a time and over that
time, I can actually find out what is the quantity that is being procured every day.
So, this is what we refer to as a time series data where the data on a particular variable;
this could be the quantity procured on potato is obtained the variable is the same. What is
the variable? It is quantity of potatoes that is the variable, but I am tracking this variable
over a period of time which is from 1st March to 30th March. So, this kind of data is
what we refer to as a time series data whereas, cross sectional data is the data which is
observed at the same time.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:24)
So, we will to broadly classify, we should know that given data we classify them broadly
as categorical or numerical. So, whenever we are presented with a data set, we should be
able to classify all the variables in the data set as a categorical variable or a numerical
variable. If it is a numerical variable, find out what is the unit of measurement. Again
check if the unit of measurement is consistent across all the observations. The third thing
is check whether it is collected at a point of time whether it is cross sectional data or
whether it is time series data. So, now, given a data set you should be able to do this.
