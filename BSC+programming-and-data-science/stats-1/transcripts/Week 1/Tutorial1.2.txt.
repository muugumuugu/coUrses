We will continue with our simple interest example. But before we go into the finer utility
of spreadsheet software
s, you should first try to represent our data in a more meaningful
format. Right now we just put down the numbers and the month names, but if somebody
were to look at this spreadsheet, they are not really going to understand what is
happening right.
So, we are going to try to format this properly and for that I think, the first thing we
should be doing is to label the columns that we have here. Clearly, the first column is all
month and we decided the second column is the interest for that month, the third column
C is the total interest and the column D is the total money that you are owed.
So, in order to represent this, it will be nice to have a heading; a label for the column. So,
something above this, for that we will add a row above the first row; so, that we can keep
the headings or the labels on them.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:38)
And for this, we first go to the row 1, we right click and here you see a lot of options you
could do. You could delete the row, you could clear the row, you could hide it, resize it,
group and a lot of things.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:51)
What we are interested in is inserting 1 row above and there we go we have a row here
and let us give the names. This one is month; this one is interest to be paid for the month.
As you can see, it is spilling over we will attend to that in a bit and then go to this cell
and this cell would be the heading for column C which is again I press enter.
This would be the total interest to be paid up to this month, again its spilling over, does
not matter, we will come back to that and then here again go and press enter and this one
would be the total money owed up to this month.
So, now we have a decent indication of what that column is. However, we have trouble
because this does not look good. First of all, the month looks the heading looks pretty
much the same as the rest of the cells in that column and here this is cut off, this is cut
off and this one is spilling over. So, we are going to have to format this so, it looks
better; so, it looks meaningful.
What we could do is, first we should make the headings the labels look distinct. So, we
could probably try to fill them with a different color instead of the whole column, I am
just going to take the non-empty ones. So, I have selected the cells A1, B1, C1 and D1
by using the shift and right key.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:56)
And now I am going to go to this, this is fill color; fill color as and it will fill the cells
with that particular color and I can choose whatever color. There are lot of colors here as
you can see; you can choose whichever and this is a Google provided theme. If you use
just these colors, you will get something that looks reasonably good. So, you can just
choose that; however, I am going to go for something kind of light. Let us look at light
green 3 and there you go. Now we have these cells have a distinct color.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:34)
We can do better; we can make them B, bold text. So, this option is the bold text which
you could also get through control B; there it is bold.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:06)
(Refer Slide Time: 05:12)
And now, we still have the trouble that some of this text is cut off some and this text is
spilling over. So, what do you want to do in these cases is again select those and you can
do what is called text wrapping. So, that is an additional option which is there.
So, if these three dots indicate more options and go to this and here, this is text wrapping
and there are three options; one is overflow which is what you are seeing now; it is
spilling over into the next cell and this is wrapping which means that text will be
adjusted into the same cell in multiple lines and this one is clip, it will get clipped to that
particular end of the cell. I think the wrap is best because we want to see the whole text
and there we go.
Now, you can see the whole text, it is coming up as multiple lines right and instead of
three lines, we might want it to be maybe just two lines. So, for that it helps if the cell
width is greater right; if the cell were wider, then we can fit this into two lines.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:18)
So, one way to do that is to expand the whole column because if you are expanding this
cell, you are expanding every cell under it. So, what you can do is take your cursor to
this edge, this border of the column click and drag it and as you can see, it is now
expanded. You can do the same for column C and again for column D.
Now, since everything is fitting into two lines, you have the cell height to be
accommodating only two lines and you could make this furthermore centrally aligned.
So, what we can do is, let us select everything we can take this shift right, right, right and
then, holding shift still go down, down, down, down, down in this way.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:17)
Now, we have selected all these cells and what we can do now is, we can center align the
text so, we again went to the more options and the horizontal alignment, we are doing it
as center.
So, what you have seen here is that, all the data is now fitted at the center of the cell and
further, we can go to vertical align as well. Here again you have a top, middle and
bottom so, we go to middle which has made the text appear at the vertical center. Now,
our spreadsheet looks considerably better to read.
We can do a little more formatting in terms of these numbers. These numbers could just
be anything right 10,000, 10,050 etcetera. But we know that, they are supposed to be
money, these are Indian rupees. So, we can do number formatting, we will again select
these cells. You see what I am doing right shift right, right and then down, down, down,
down yeah.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:107)
(Refer Slide Time: 08:31)
(Refer Slide Time: 08:33)
And now, we go to the format option here and here, we have a number of formatting
options whatever you have seen there are also here. There is a alignment, left center right
is for horizontal, top middle bottom is for vertical and there are lot of other options. We
will see them slowly later.
(Refer Time: 08:36)
But what we are looking at is number formatting. So, in number formatting, there are lot
of options. What we are looking for is currency, but the default currency that Google
sheets offers is the dollar symbol; what we want is the Indian rupee.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:53)
So, we go to more formats, then more currencies and within this, if we went down we
will see so, there are all these other currency options for formatting.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:04)
But, let us look for the Indian rupee and here we are. This is the rupee symbol and if you
apply this, all of this is now in Indian rupees. And now this looks like a good simple
interest sheet.
In this video, we have seen some of the formatting options, but they are actually a lot of
them. For example, we have not looked at the Italic option or the strikethrough option
and there is also an underlining the text option which is here in the format. So, you are
encouraged to go through all these options, play around with all the formatting and find
formats that work for you that you think looks good. But more than looking good, make
sure that your spreadsheet is doing what you wanted to do; it should represent the data to
you in a very usable way.
So, the other options could be the whole we have seen text wrapping, vertical alignment,
horizontal alignment. There is also the borders, fill color we have seen, this is the text
color. You can play with all of this bar and the other things that are in here. We will see
more of these maybe in future. Right now let us go on to seeing how to make more use
of spreadsheets with the same example.
Thank you.
