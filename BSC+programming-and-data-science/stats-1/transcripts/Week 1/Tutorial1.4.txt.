Hello, welcome back. In this tutorial video, we will see how to save our spreadsheet
from Google sheets; Google sheets is on the internet. You might want to download your
spreadsheet into your machine into your computer. So, how do we do that is, we go to
file and then we go to download and these are the various formats.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:49)
So, the most popular one is xlsx which is the format for a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel
which is a Microsoft product.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:59)
And you could also download in the .ods format which is for Open Office or you could
also use it for Libre Office. These are open source spreadsheet software and pdf is the
portable document format which is not a spreadsheet, it will let you see the spreadsheet,
but you cannot really treat it as a spreadsheet, you cannot open it again on Google sheets
or Microsoft Excel or Libre Office right.
Web page is also similar to that, it is a dot html. You could open it on your browser such
as Chrome or Firefox or Internet Explorer or whatever it is and this comma separated
values which is the .csv file is something that can be used across platforms. For example,
.xlsx works best with Excel, .ods works best with Open Office or Libre Office and .csv
will open with whether it is Google sheets or Excel or Open Office.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:53)
(Refer Slide Time: 02:12)
Anyway, for our purposes, let us download it as a Microsoft Excel file which is .xlsx. So,
I click on that and now we have my Downloads folder showing. I could download it here
or I could go back to This PC, these are all the folders that are there in This PC. I could
go to Documents which is where I would like to put my Stats1 tutorials. So, this is
another folder and within this folder, I will create a new folder which happens by right
click and then go to New and then Folder. This one I will call 
Downloading and
uploading spreadsheets
Once I type that press enter. Now open this folder and here I will save my spreadsheet
file. Chrome is showing that it is been downloaded.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:22)
Now, how do I go there? I could go to downloads and in downloads, I can look at show
in folder and here we have our Excel file. I can open this on Excel. Now let us close this
and we will see what to do with downloading data sets from the internet.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:58)
So, let us go to the internet. A good source for downloading data sets is data.gov.in
which has a lot of India-related based data sets, it is the government website. So, you
have all these options.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:23)
Let us say we will look at something on traffic and now you see all these options. Let us
say we look at International Air Traffic Data, I clicked on that and it is a csv file.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:37)
(Refer Slide Time: 04:40)
So, I will click on that too, it asks me these details; I will fill them up and once I have
filled them up, begins to download as a csv file; save. Now I would like to open this csv
file in Google sheets, the csv file I downloaded from data.gov.in.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:14)
So, let me go back to the spreadsheet and to go to the spreadsheet, home I click on this
sheets home icon there and here we are. Now, let us open a new spreadsheet, blank and
here let us open our csv file. For this what we do? File and Open; control O and I would
like to upload my file from the machine.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:29)
(Refer Slide Time: 05:38)
(Refer Slide Time: 05:41)
(Refer Slide Time: 05:49)
So, I will select a file from the device or I could simply just drag this, I could click hold
and drag it here and it opens up and this is the data that we have downloaded from the
internet. So, this way you could download and use datasets that you have gotten from the
internet.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:20)
And now how do we arrange all these sheets? So, let us go back to sheets home. Now, let
us go to drive - Google drive which in this option we have it here drive, drive is arranged
like the folder system that we have seen on our machine. So, the folder system as you
can see these are the folders here. Let us open any of those and I could go back to My
Drive and here we are. If we went to this folder, again I could go back to My Drive in
this way and I might want to keep all these spreadsheets in a folder.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:58)
So, I can create a folder by right clicking adding a New folder; I will called it simply
spreadsheets, I created and into this folder, I would like to add these spreadsheets. For
example, this international traffic data that we just downloaded, I can click hold and drag
into this folder, likewise our spreadsheet example on simple interest. I can also again
hold this drag and put in the spreadsheets folder.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:38)
So, now if I open the spreadsheets folder, I have these two spreadsheets inside it. So, this
way you can organize your drive. You could just the way you can organize the folders
and files in your computer and whatever you have in your Google sheets, you could
directly open from there and begin to work with the data.
Thank you.
