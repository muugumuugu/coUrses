A survey of IITM students by the XYZ agency reveled that almost 80% disapprove the necessary
attendance criteria of the institute. If 10 students are selected at random and asked their opinion,
find the probability that the number who disapprove the attendance criteria is atmost 7.So, how we
can relate this problem to binomial distribution?
So, if you take 1 student, that student will either approve or disapprove the necessary attendance
criteria. So, each trial has an 2 outcomes and the probability that the student will disapprove that
criteria is 80%, that means 0.80 is the probability that the student disapprove that necessary
attendance criteria.
So, how many students you have chosen? 10, so your 
 will 10. What you have been asked here?
Find the number who disapprove the attendance criteria is atmost 7. That means you have to find
the probability will 
 is the random variable that the student will, that the number of student who
disapprove the attendance criteria, so the value is atmost 7.
So, value of 
7. You can write this since you have 10 students. So, your 
 can take value 0, 1,
2, 3,
.10. You have been asked the value of less than equal to 7, you can write this in other way
 = 8) + 
 = 9) + 
 = 10)]. So, what is the meaning here? 
 = 8) when 
takes value 9, when 
 takes value 10. That means here what is the probability that 8 students will
disapprove the necessary attendance criteria.
Here, the probability that the number like total 9 students will disapprove the attendance, necessary
attendance criteria here a student will disapprove the necessary attendance criteria. So, now you
can use here binomial. So, you can write this as 1 minus, see, 
 is 10 here, 
 will be your 8, so
8 probability of success that is probability who will disapprove the necessary 0.8, so (0.8)
that is 1 
 [ 10
8 (0.8)8 (1 
 0.8)2 + 10
9 (0.8)9 (1 
 0.8) + 10
10 (0.8)10 (1 
 0.8)0 ],.
You can write this as 1 
 [ 10
8 (0.8)8 (0.2)2 + 10
9 (0.8)9 (0.2) + 10
10 (0.8)10 ], this will be your
probability that the attendance criteria is disapproved by atmost 7 people. Thank you.
