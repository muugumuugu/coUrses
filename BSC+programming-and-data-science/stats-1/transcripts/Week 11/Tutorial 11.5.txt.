A satellite system consists of 10 components and can work properly if at least 4 of the 10
components are in working condition. If each component is independently in working condition
with probability 0.7, what is the probability that the system works properly? So, what condition
we have so that the system work properly, at least 4 out of the 10 components are in working
condition.
So, let us define the random variable let 
 be a random variable that number of component, how
many number of components are working. So, here we have 10 component, so the our 
 can take
the value from 0 to 10. So, what we have to find basically is at least 4 out of 10 that means what
is the probability that 
 4. This we can write as 1 
 3). And this 1 further can be write
 = 0), 
 = 1), 
 = 2)+ 
 = 3).
So, this will be our value that the system will work properly. Now, we can see this 1 
 = 0)
that means out of 10, so 10
0. So, probability of success what we have is 0.7, 0.7, 0, (1 
 0.7), 0.3
power and 
 that is (10 
 0) that is 10. Now, 1 
 [ 10
0 (0.7)0 (0.3)10 + 10
1 (0.7)1 (0.3)9 +
2 (0.7)2 (0.3)8 ] so this will be our required probability that our system, our satellites itself will
work properly. Thank you.
