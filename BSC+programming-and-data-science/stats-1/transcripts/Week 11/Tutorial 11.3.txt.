Let 
 we have binomial random variable with expectation this is 9 and variance is 4.95. Find the
value of 
 = 12). So, from the given information first we have to find the value of 
 and 
. So,
as we know expectation of binomial random variable is given by 
 and which is given as 9 and
variance of binomial distribution is given by 
) which is given as 4.95.
So, from here we can put the value of 
. So, we will get that 9 
 (1 
) =4.95, we will solve
this, we will get that 1 
4.95
which is nothing but 0.55. So, this implies that the value of 
0.45, putting this value of 
 in 
, we get 
 = 0.45 which is nothing is 20.
So, we got the value of 
 that is 20, we got the value of 
 0.45 and we have here the value of 
12. Now, we will use directly the formula for binomial distribution and we can see that this can be
written as
12 0.45 the value of 
 that is 12, (1 
) that is 0.55, 0.55
 that is nothing but 8,
 12 that is 8. So, this will be our value of 
 = 12). Thank you.
