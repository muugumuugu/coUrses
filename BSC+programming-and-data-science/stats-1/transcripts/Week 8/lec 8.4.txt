Conditional Probability - Independent events
(Refer Slide Time: 00:13)
In this lecture, we are going to look at an extremely important concept which is called
independence of events.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:23)
So, if you recall that we have already seen what are joint, marginal and conditional
probabilities. We introduced the notion of conditional probabilities and the multiplication
rules so far. So, today we are going to look at what do we mean by independent events?
(Refer Slide Time: 00:40)
So, let us begin by asking a question, will the conditional probability of an event. So suppose
I have two events let me call the events 
 and 
. These are the two events defined on the
same sample space. So the question we are asking is will the conditional probability that 
occurs given that 
 has occurred and we have already seen that I am writing this as E occurs
given F has occurred.
So, the question that is being asked is will the conditional probability of 
 given 
 has
occurred be equal to the unconditional probability of 
. So this is what we refer to as the
unconditional probability of 
 and this is the conditional probability of 
 occurring given 
occurring. So the question is will this situation happen generally or will it not happen so that
is the question we are asking.
Now, let us understand what the left hand side means? It says that will the conditionality
probability of 
 given 
 occurring be equal to the unconditional probability. So what we are
asking is when will they if the conditional probability equals to the unconditional probability
then it means that 
 does not depend on 
. In other words, no matter what is this occurrence
or non occurrence of this event 
 is unaffected because of it.
So, we are introducing a notion of whether there is any dependence of this event occurring
given the information F has occurred or not. So, this is the question that we are going to
answer and that is being answered by the following.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:09)
This is the question we are asking again is will knowing that 
 has occurred generally
changed the chances of 
 occurrence. So, let us look at a simple example again I toss a coin
twice I know my experiment is tossing a coin twice and this is my sample space. Now
suppose I do not talk about probability or sample spaces I am just tossing a coin twice. Now
the first toss is a head.
Now, the question we are asking is suppose I define an event 
 to be first toss is a head or let
me define event 
 to be first toss is a head and event 
 to be second toss is a head. So the
question we are asking is will the knowledge of the fact that the first toss is a head generally
changed the chances of 
 occurrence in the sense that if I know that the first toss was a head
will the chance of me getting a head or a tail in the second toss change.
So, we know that independently the probability of you getting a head or a probability of
getting a tail in a fair coin is equal to half. Now if you look at this, if my toss is a head I know
a head has happened. So this is my reduce sample space. Now in this sample space you again
see the probability of getting a head or a tail is the same. In other words, you can see that the
chance or the information knowing that I had a head in my first toss did not change the
chance of a head in the second toss.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:21)
So, the question that is being asked is in general do we think that where are cases, are there
cases where the conditional probability equals the unconditional probability. So we have just
seen a case where probability of getting a tail or a head is equal to half and probability of
getting head in the second toss given you have got a head in the first toss is also equal to half
and these two are equal.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:58)
So, in cases where the conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability we say
that 
 is independent of 
. I repeat in cases where the conditional probability is equal to the
unconditional probability we say that 
 is independent of 
. So in our coin tossing example
you can see that getting a head in the second toss, getting a head in second toss is
independent of getting a head in first toss.
In other words, whether I got a head or tail in the first toss would not affect my chances of
getting a head or tail in the second toss. So in this case we say the events are independent
events.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:08)
So, in other words we say that 
 is independent of an event if knowing whether 
 occurs
does not affect the probability of 
. So this is the notion of independence of events.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:28)
So, let us look at a formal definition to it. So since again from my multiplication rule I know
probability given two events 
 and 
 I know the multiplication rule says that the probability
of the intersection is 
). This is from my definition of conditional probability
which says the 
where 
) > 0. I get 
) = 
Now, 
 is independent of 
, I said that the conditional probability is equal to the
unconditional probability. Hence, we get 
) = 
) which is nothing, but the
product of the probabilities. Recall in the addition rule when I had disjoint a mutually
exclusive events, recall in the addition rule when I had disjoint a mutually exclusive events
the probability of the union was the sum of the probabilities.
Similarly, when I have independent events, probability of the intersection is product of the
probabilities of the events. Hence I can pose my formal definition which says that two events
 and 
 are independent if the probability of intersection is equal to the product of
probabilities.
I repeat two events 
 and 
 are independent if the probability of the intersection of these two
events is equal to the product of the probabilities. So once we know what is an independent
event we are now in a position to define what is a dependent event. So two events that are not
independent are said to be dependent.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:47)
So, this notion of independence is extremely important. So recall the multiplication rule for
two events are 
) = 
) where 
)>0. So now for two independent events
I will have 
) so that is my multiplication rule says that for any two events if 
 and 
are independent than probability of the intersection is equal to the product of the
probabilities.
So, conversely it make sense for us to answer that if 
) = 
) then can I say
that 
 and 
 are independent that is the converse of the statement the answer is yes.
Conversely, so this I have if 
 and 
 are independent then the probability of the intersection
is product of probability. The converse is if probability of 
 intersection is product of the
probabilities of events then 
 and 
 are independent.
So, hence I have a basic rule which is referred to as a multiplication rule for two independent
events which states that two events are independent if and only if and the if and only if comes
from this if 
 and 
 are independent then this happens. If probability of the intersection is
equal to the product of probability then 
 and 
 are independent. Hence this is nothing but a
necessary and sufficient condition, but the word of caution is I am looking at two events.
So, if the probability of both of them occurring together equals the product of the individual
probabilities then we state that the two events are independent. To look at more than two
events the definition of independence where more than two events that is three or more
events is slightly more complicated we will look at it later, but for now I want you all to
understand that if two events are independent if and only if the probability of the intersection.
In other words, the probability that both occur together equals the product of their individual
probabilities. So this is what we refer to as multiplication rule for independent events.
