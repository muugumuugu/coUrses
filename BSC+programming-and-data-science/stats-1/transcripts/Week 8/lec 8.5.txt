Conditional Probability - Independent Events Examples
(Refer Slide Time: 00:14)
Now let us look at an example we have already established the sample space of the
experiment of rolling a dice twice. We know that the sample space has 36 outcomes and these
are the 36 outcomes that are listed in the sample space. Each one of them are equally likely
that is another assumption we have and we also know it is a good assumption it is not a bad
assumption to have.
So now let us define three events. E1 is the event that the first outcome is the 3 so we can see
that this outcome, this outcome, this outcome, this outcome, this outcome and this outcome
namely (3,1), (3, 2), (3,3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6) are the outcomes in my event E1. E2 is the
outcome, sum of outcomes is a 8. So now I can see that let me denote it by cross 5+3, 4+4,
3+5, 2+ 6 and 6+ 2.
These are the outcomes that satisfy this and they are in this event E2. Now when I look at sum
of outcomes as a 7 I see the outcomes I put a circle here (1,0), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2) and
(6,1) these are the outcomes in my event E3, but now having defined this events the question
we are asking is are E1 and E2 independent and are E1 and E3 independent. So before we go to
verify whether E1 and E2 and E1 and E3 are independent events.
Let us look at the intuition behind independence. Now E2 is an event where the sum of
outcome is 8. Now let us write down the following the first throw of a dice and the second
throw of a dice. Now to get a sum of 8 if the first row was a 1 I cannot get a sum of 8 because
the maximum that I can get in a second throw is 6 and 1 plus 6 is 8. So if the first throw is a 1
I cannot get a sum of 8.
The first row is a 2 I need to have a 6, 3, 5, 4, 4, 5, 3 and 6, 2. In a sense to get a sum of 8 I
need the first throw to be either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 to get a sum of 8. Now let us repeat the
experiment with 7. So if I have sum 7 written here the first throw is a 1 then if the second
throw is a 6 I get a sum of 7 5 I get a sum of 7 3 plus 4 is a 7, 4 plus 3 is a 7, 5 + 2 is a 7 and 6
+ 1 is a 7.
So to get a sum of 7 I see that the first throw can be of these 6 values and I get a sum of 7
which is possible with this second throw whereas to get a sum of 8 we saw that if the first
throw was a 1 it is impossible to get a sum of 8. In other words to get a sum of 8, the sum 8 is
dependent on what was your first throw whereas the sum 7 was independent of what was
your first throw so this is the intuition.
So sum to get an 8 I could not have got a sum of 8 if my first throw was a 1 whereas a sum 7
is independent even if it was a 1 and I throw a 6 I get a sum of 7 if it was a 2 and I throw a 5
so it is independent of whatever was my first throw there is a chance of me a sum of 7
whereas to get a sum of 8 I needed the first throw to be either a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or a 5 or a 6.
So intuitively we can say that E1 and E2 are not independent.
Whereas E1 and E3 are independent events. Now let us apply the formula to actually verify it.
Recall the formula sates that if E1 and E2 are independent then the probability of the
intersection has to be the product of the probability so this is what we have to check.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:26)
So let us go to the first thing E1 and E2 are independent. So I know
is a event that the
first outcome is a 3 and the sum of outcomes as a 8 that is how I can articulate the event
. I know that only this outcome and since all the outcomes are equally likely I know
the probability of this outcome alone is equal to 1 by 36 and I know that is what I have as the
probability of
which is
Now probability of E1, E1 is the event that the first outcome is a 3 again we saw that the
outcomes the first outcomes is a 3 has these 6 outcomes where the outcome is a 3. So my E1
event has the outcomes the outcomes of the E1 event is going to be (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4),
(3,5) and (3,6) again using that all of them are equally likely and the probability of events I
get probability of E1 is
Probability of E2 where the sum of outcomes is a 8 we also saw that there are 5 outcomes
which give an outcome of 8 hence probability of E2 equal to is
is not equal to is
. Now you can see that is
. Hence, again using the if and only if condition we can conclude that
probability of E1 intersection E2 is not equal to the product of probabilities hence E1 and E2
are not independent events.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:34)
So the next question we are asking is are E1 and E3 independent? So E1 intersection E3 is the
events that the first outcome is a 3 and sum of outcomes is a 4 so this is probability of 3, 4
which is is
. So I have probability of E1 intersection E3 is probability of 3,4 which is is
So I have probability of E1 as before which is equal to is
I can see that this is equal to is .
I have probability of E3 is probability of (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2) and (6,1) which is
equal to is
which is also equal to is . Hence I have
which tells me that probability of, hence
P(E1) P(E3) in this case
is probability of E1 into probability of E3.
Hence the events E1 and E3 are independent events.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:45)
Now let us go and apply this notion of independence to our cards or deck of cards example.
So again consider the experiment of randomly selecting one card from this deck of 52 playing
cards. Let me define the following events E1 is a face card is selected. What is a face card?
Face card is a card which has a face on it so I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of these
cards which are referred to as face cards.
These cards which has a face namely jack, queen or king are the cards that are referred to as a
face card. So, a face card is selected you can see that I have 12 cards which gives me
probability of E1 is 12/52. Now probability of E2 is the event that a king is selected again you
can see that the event a king is selected I have 4 kings and the chance of choosing a king from
52 card is going to be 4/52.
A heart so you can see an event an heart is selected I have here 13 hearts so the probability or
the chance that I am selecting a heart probability of E3 is is
. So these are the actual
probabilities which I can have. Now the question that is being asked is are E1 and E2
independent events. So now let us understand what is
. Now E1 is a face card E2 is a
king card.
So E1 E2 is the event that a king face card is selected which is equivalent to the probability a
king is selected. Similarly, E2 and E3 what does the event E2 E3? E2 is a king E3 is a heart so
E2 E3 is the event a king and heart. In other words, a king of hearts is selected. So now the
question we are asking first question are E1 and E2 independent events?
So now let us look at the first question which is asking about
that is knowing that a
face card is selected will that affect my chance of having a king. So you can see that there are
12 face cards. Now if I know that a face card is selected then I know that the chance of
getting a king from these 12 cards is is
intuitive explanation, but whereas if I know that a
king is selected the chance of you having a heart is just is .
Now the chance of you having a heart from these 52 cards is also is
which is is . Now this
whether you choose a king or a queen again a chance of you getting a heart if you had
selected a queen is also is whether jack is also is , 10 also the chance of getting a heart is is
, 9 is . So you see that the chance of you getting a heart is not dependent on whatever has
been the card.
Whereas the chance of you getting a king changes if you know the information that what you
had taken was a face card.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:35)
So now us move forward and verify this. So
is the event that a face card and a king is
selected. So we know that this probability is nothing, but the probability of having a king. We
know there are 4 king card which is king of hearts, king of clubs, king of spades and king of
diamonds. Hence, the probability of a face card and the king is the same as the probability of
a king which is 4/52. So what is the probability of a face card?
Again I know there are 12 face cards, jack heart, jack clubs, jack spades, jack diamond, king
hearts, king clubs, king space, king diamonds, queen hearts, queen clubs, queen spades and
queen diamonds. Hence, the probability of this event E1 that is getting a face card is 12/52,
probability of getting a king is 4/52 you can verify
Hence, my
. So, E1 and E2 are not independent of each other
something which we could explain intuitively. Now let us look at the case of E2 and E3. Now
what is event E2? E2 is the event that there is a king, E3 is the event of a heart so
the event of a king and a heart. In other words you are selecting a king of hearts card.
So probability of
is just the probability of choosing the king of heart cards which is
1/52 considering all of them are equally likely events. Now probability of choosing a heart.
So probability of choosing a king is 4/52, probability of choosing a heart is I can have a 2,
3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 jack king or queen so 13 possible choices it is 13/52. We observe
So this is 13 so I get this is 1/52 hence I can say that since
. E2
and E3 are indeed independent events. This is something which we even checked intuitively.
