# WEEK 1 Downloading Data, Intro to Statistics

## 1.1 : Introduction and Types of Data - Basic Definitions

>The art of learning from data

### Branches of Statistcs

+ Descriptive Statistics - summarization and description
	+ purpose of study is to examine info for its own intrinsic interest
+ Inferential Statistics - drawing conclusions from data
	+ involves dealing with possibility of chance
	+ draws conclusion about the entire dataset( *poplation* ) from a chosen subset( the *sample* )
### DataSets

+ population
	+ all elements we are interested in
+ sample
	+ subset of the population which will be studied in detail.
	+ a good sample has good representation.
>inference from sample can be extended to be true, upto some error, for the population

## 1.2: Introduction and Types of Data - Understanding Data

### Data

> facts & figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for interpretation and presentation.

+ Where to Find Data?
	+ Data Already Available - download the published data
		+ [Gov. provided Common Data Sets](http://data.gov.in)
	+ Data Not Available - generate and/or collect data.

### Organization of Data

+ Unstructured Data is scattered and needs *Contextualization* and *Organization* before Analysis.
+ Organization is posible thru many ways, like **tabulation**, etc.

#### Variables and Cases

+ case - a unit from which data is collected.
+ variable - attribute of the units that varies across the sampling set of the units.

#### Tabulation

+ each variable must have its own column, and same type of value/measurement unit across the units to be consistent and comparable
+ each case has its own unique row, with values ( could be NA ) for each variable.

## 1.3 : Introduction and Types of Data - Classification of Data

>Numerical Data
+ Unit of Measurement
+ quantitative
+ types
	+ discrete
	+ continuous

>Categorical Data
+ Value of Variable belongs to a certaim enumerable set of values.
	+ identify the group membership
+ qualitative

>Time Series Data
>> data recorded over time

>Cross Sectional Data
>>data recorded at a point of time

## 1.4 : Introduction and Types of Data - Scales of Measurement

## Categorical Data

### Nominal Scale of Measurement
+ NO ordering in such variables.
+ they are just lables.
+ they can be numerically coded.
+ only give an characterestic identification to the case.
+ don't imply amything
+ example
	+ gender
	+ jersey number

### Ordinal Scale of  Measurement
+ labels with ranks.
+ order relevant.
+ data is still a label, that is it takes a categorical value, and hence can also be numerically codded (keep order in mind).
+ example
	+ worded ratings

## Numerical Data

### Interval Scale of Measurement
+ extends on ordinal data, and also has a fixed unit to measure differenece between two values.
+ always numeric.
+ ratios meaningless since irts all about the differences, the zero is arbitrary.
+ example
	+ star ratings

### Ratio Scale of Measurement
+ extends from interval data, and has a fixed , meaningful zero, so that a standalone value also is a useable characteristic.
+ possible to perform all arithmetic on such data
+ example
	+ height
