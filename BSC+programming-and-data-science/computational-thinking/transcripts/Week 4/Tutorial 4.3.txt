Hello CT students, in this tutorial we will look at this particular pseudocode and what it does,
this is for a procedure called Count Vowels and Consonants and this procedure takes a parameter
X which is a card and this card has such attributes as letter count and the word and such. So, let
us take an example here for seeing what this procedure does.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:51)
So, here we have a card with the word reluctant and this card is passed as the parameter X. Now,
in the procedure we are initializing a variable i is equal to 1, Vcount is 0, Ccount is 0, these are
two variables which are being initialized to 0. Clearly Vcount is supposed to stand for vowel
count and Ccount is supposed to stand for consonant count.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:33)
Now, we have a while loop here with the condition that i is lesser than or equal to X dot letter
count. So, i has been declared to be 1 and here the letter count is 9. So, 1 is lesser than 9
therefore we go inside the while loop and here we have an if statement with the condition that the
ith letter of X dot word is a vowel.
Now, the ith later here in this case i is 1 so r is the ith letter and it is not a vowel. So, we do not
perform the code inside this if statement instead we go to what is coming after which is an else
statement. So, since this statement is not true, we go into this line of code now and we increment
Ccount to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:34)
Now, we are out of this else block and we are incrementing i to i plus 1 so i is now 2. And then
we go back to the while condition is i lesser than or equal to x dot letter count, yes 2 is lesser
than 9. So, we go inside again and now if we check for the ith letter of X dot word being a
vowel. So, here the ith letter is e is the second letter and it is a vowel. So, we basically now
increment Vcount the vowel count is incremented by 1, giving us 1 vowel and 1 consonant so
far. Since we entered this if block we do not go into the else block.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:20)
And we now increment i to 3. Again, 3 is lesser than 9 therefore look if the third letter of X dot
word is a vowel and the third letter is a consonant it is not a vowel. So, we go into the else block
and we increment Ccount to 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:46)
And now increment i to 4 and go back to the while loop 4 is lesser than 9. So, enter the while
loop and we check if the fourth letter of the word reluctant is a vowel, it is u is a vowel.
Therefore, we increment Vcount and Vcount now becomes 2. We have seen 2 vowels and 2
consonants so far.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:16)
So, we do not get into the else block because we are already gone into the if block, we increment
i to 5 and then go back to the while condition 5 is less than 9 therefore go inside and check if the
fifth letter of the word reluctant is a vowel it is not. So, we go to the else block where we
increment Ccount to 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:46)
And then we come out of this else block and we increment i to 6. Again, go back to the while
condition 6 is lesser than 9. Now, check if the sixth letter of X dot word is a vowel. The sixth
letter is not a vowel it is t. So, therefore we go into the else block and here we increment the
consonant count to 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:16)
We come out of it, and we now increment i to 7. And then we check the while condition again 7
is less than 9. So, go inside and we check the, if condition again is the seventh letter of X dot
word a vowel, yes a is a vowel. Therefore, we increment Vcount and that gives us 3 vowels and
4 consonants so far. We do not do anything in the else block because we have already gone in to
the if block.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:50)
Now, we increment i to 8 and we check if 8 is less than 9 it is so we go inside and if the eighth
letter is a vowel, the eighth letter is not a vowel is n. So, we go into the else block and we
increment Ccount to 5.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:15)
And then we get out and here we increment i to 9 and then 9 is less than or equal to 9. Therefore,
we go inside again and we check if the ninth letter of X dot word is vowel, it is not its t. So, we
basically increment the consonant count again, and that gives us 6 continents so far and 3
vowels.
(Refer Slide Time: 06:43)
And then we come out and we increment i to 10, then when we check this condition this fails
now because 10 is not lesser than or equal to 9. So, we are out of this while loop all together and
then the procedure returns Vcount and Ccount which in this case would be 3 and 6 respectively.
So, this procedure returns the count of vowel and the count of consonants and then we end the
procedure. Thank you.
