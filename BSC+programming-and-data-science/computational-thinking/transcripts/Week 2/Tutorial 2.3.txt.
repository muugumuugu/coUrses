Hello computational thinking students. In this tutorial, we are going to look at a procedure
which is similar to what the professors have done in lecture 13 which is to find the store with
the maximum number of bills.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:31)
For our tutorial, we will look at the problem where we find the city with maximum number of
students in the scorecard dataset.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:42)
So we need to start with first initializing the variable which is maximum city count. This
variable will be initialize to 0 and we increment every time we see a larger city count and the
city counts are supposed to come every time we encounter a new city. For example, here we
are coming across Erode for the first time. So, we make a variable called Erode count and we
initialize it to 0 and since we have seen one card of Erode we incremented by 1.
So Erode count is 1 and since Erode count being 1 is the maximum city count we have seen
so far, we are going to update our max city count to 1. Now, going card by card Salem we are
encountering for the first time, so we declare a new variable called Salem count. We initialize
it to 0 and then we incremented by 1. Now, Chennai again we are seeing for the first time so
new variable Chennai count initialize to 0 increment by 1.
So far max city count has been 1 only because all cards we have seen, all cities we have seen
had only one student each so far. And now Chennai has two students. So increment Chennai
count to 2 and since this is larger than the max city count being 1 we are going to change our
max city count value from 1 to 2. Madurai is new. So Madurai count is declared initialize to 0
and incremented by 1.
Max city count does not change because 1 is still less than 1. One more Chennai so Chennai
count is now 3 which means it is greater than our current max city count value. So max city
count has to be updated to 3. Again Ambur is new. So Ambur count is declared initialized to
0 incremented by 1. No change in max city count because 1 is lesser than 3. Now, we see
Vellore, Vellore is new.
So new variable initialize to 0 increment by 1 no change in max city count because 1 is still
less than 3. Again new city, new variable, initialize to 0 increment by 1 no change in max city
count. One more Bengaluru, so Bengaluru count will now increase by 1. So we have
Bengaluru count at 2. One more Chennai now so this makes Chennai count 4 and that would
imply max city count has to change because 4 is greater than 3. So max city count has to be
updated to 4.
Bengaluru again so this time we are at 3 Bengaluru but no change in max city count. Chennai
again so now Chennai count is 5. Therefore max city count also has to change to 5. Madurai
is now at 2. Trichy is new. So declare Trichy count as a variable initialize it to 0 increment by
1. Same with Teni it is new. So Teni count is initialize to 0 and incremented by 1. Trichy
again so we now have Trichy count is 2 and now we are at Chennai again.
Chennai is now at 6 students and that means our max city count also has to be updated to 6.
Erode count is now 2. Trichy count will now be equal to 3. Vellore count is now going to be
equal to 2. Bengaluru count is now 4. Nagarcoil is new. So Nagercoil count is declared
initialize to 0 incremented by 1 and then we have Bengaluru count going to 5 and then we
have Madurai count being incremented to 3.
Again Chennai so Chennai count is now incremented to 7 and that means our max city count
also has to be updated it is now 7. Chennai again, 8 students in Chennai and that means max
city count also is updated to 8. Now there is 4 Madurai, 5 Madurai and 3 Vellore and this is
the last count so our max city count is 8. Thank you.
