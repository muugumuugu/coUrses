Tutorial 2.5
(Refer Slide Time: 0:14)
Hello CT students. In lecture 15 professor Madhavan Mukund had shown the procedure to find
the frequency of every individual word in the paragraph. So, for each new word we encounter,
we declare a new variable, keep its frequency 0 and incremented by 1. And when we come to a
word which is already there whose frequency was already 1, then we increment it to 2. So, this
way we keep increasing the frequency every time we see the word again. And when we find a
new word we add a new variable, initialize it to 0 and increment it by 1. We are going to do a
similar procedure now with the shopping bill dataset.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:01)
We are going to find the number of bills per customer in this dataset. So, for this every time we
encounter a new customer, we declare a new variable, initialize it to 0 and increment it by 1 and
each time that customer shows up again we will increment that variable by 1. So, here let us
begin we have Srivatsan, this is our first card Srivatsan for SV Stores. So, let us declare a
variable for Srivatsan and we initialize it to 0 and then we increment it by 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:44)
Now, we have Sudeep who again we initialize to 0 and increment by 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:51)
Now, we have Akshaya, again 0, 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 1:59)
Then there is Advaith, again 0, 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:08)
Now, there is Akshaya again, therefore 1 now becomes 2, so Akshaya variable is incremented by
(Refer Slide Time: 2:19)
There is Srivatsan again, so srivatsan goes from 1 to 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:26)
Now, we have Akhil who is new. So, we have Akhil being 0 and then incremented to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:38)
Advaith is back, so 1 is now incremented to 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:46)
Mohit is new so we have initialization to 0 and incrementing by 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 2:59)
And Rajesh is also new, we do the same thing which is initialized to 0, increment by 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:10)
And Abhinav is new, so 0 and then 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:19)
Aparna is new, 0, 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:26)
Abhinav is there already so we go from 1 to 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:32)
Vignesh is new, so we are now initializing to 0 and incrementing by 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:42)
Abhinav is there again, so Abhinav is probably the current maximum.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:48)
Advaith is there, Advaita is also on three right now.
(Refer Slide Time: 3:53)
George is new, so 0 and 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:02)
Ahmed is also new, so initialize to 0 increment to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:10)
Neeraja is new, Neeraja initialize to 0 increment to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:21)
Ahmed this is here again, so 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:25)
Akshaya is there again, so 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:30)
Suresh is new, so Suresh is initialized to 0 and incremented to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:41)
Julia is also new, so 0 and 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:50
Neeraja was there already, Neeraja is here, so neeraj is now on 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:57)
Ahmed was also there, so Ahmed is now on 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:04)
Srivatsan is also now on 3, Srivatsan is now on 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:13)
Vignesh, saw Vignesh before so 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:21)
Ahmed is on 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 5:26)
Radha is new I think, so Radha is on 0 goes to 1. This is the last card in our dataset. Now, in
order to get the maximum number of shopping bills for a customer what we need to do is go
through these variables, the customer variables and find out the maximum. But that would
involve two iterations.
(Refer Slide Time: 6:02)
Instead if you look at what the professor had done in the lecture, he declared a variable called
max frequency which he kept at 0 which we initialized to 0 and each time the frequency of any
variable is greater than max frequency, max frequency was also updated to that new frequency,
so it is 1 now and these are all 1
And now was becomes 2, so the max frequency is also updated to 2. And again was becomes 3
so max frequency is now updated to 3. So, in this way, in one iteration itself by keeping an extra
variable called max frequency we get the max frequency at the end of a single iteration. Let us
do the same thing with our shopping bill dataset.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:04)
So, we have one variable which is max bills which is initialized to 0 and from there on we go
through every card I am doing the same procedure as before. So, we start with Srivatsan,
Srivatsan is initialized to 0 and because there is one card now, Srivatsan is incremented to 1. And
now max bills 0 is less than 1, so max bills needs to be updated, we go from 0 to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:43)
Then we have Sudeep, who also gives us 1 no improvement in max bills.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:49)
Akshaya 1 again.
(Refer Slide Time: 7:55)
Advaith 1 again.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:01)
And now there is one more Akshaya, so akshaya becomes 2, 2 is greater than our max bills
value, so max bills needs to be updated to 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:11)
Then one more Srivatsan, Srivatsan is now on 2, max bills is the same as 2 therefore we do not
need to update.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:20)
Akhil is new, so it is 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:29)
Advaith is now on 2, max bills is also 2, so no updating.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:34)
Mohit is new.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:43)
Rajesh is also new.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:49)
Abhinav is new.
(Refer Slide Time: 8:57)
Aparna is new.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:04)
Abhinav is now on 2 max bills, two is the same as 2, therefore no updating.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:09)
Vignesh is on 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:16)
One more Abhinav, so Abhinav is now on 3, 3 is greater than or max bills value 2, therefore max
bills is updated to 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:26)
Advaith is also on 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:31)
George is new so 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:38)
Ahmed is new so 1 again.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:45)
Neeraja is also new, 1 again.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:55)
Ahmed one more 2. Max is 3 so we do not update.
(Refer Slide Time: 9:59)
Akshaya is also on 3, max is the same as 3, so we do not update.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:05)
Suresh is new, so only 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:11)
Julia is new, so only 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:21)
Neeraja one more 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:25)
Ahmed is on 3.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:30)
Srivatsan is also on 3, max bills is still 3, so there is no updating happening.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:39)
Now, Srivatsan goes to 4, max bills is less than 4 therefore update to 4.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:46)
Vignesh is on 2.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:50)
Ahmed also goes to 4, however max bills is already 4, so no need to update.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:58)
Radha is new, so 1 and this is our last bill. Therefore, max bills is 4 and we got this in one
iteration, we know that the maximum number of bills a customer has in this dataset is 4.
