# WEEK 1

## Lec 01 - Learning English

### how language works.
+ a product of human mind's tendency to fins and apply patterns.
+ so
 in younger age
 reverse engeineering patterns comes naturally
 since no pattern is already fed.
+ after 15 years some older patterns have to be ignored which makes learning slightly obstructed in case of languages.
+ but the primal language does ease one into another language
 on the surface it might seem erranous
 but communication in the newer language becomes possible thru the older rules too.

+ Computation of Language occurs using  ***Univeral Grammar*** and the ***L**anguage **A**quisitiom **D**evice*.
+ As adults
 manipulating the already set vocal cords and articultors also takes extra effort.

## Lec 02 - Sounds and Writing Symbols in English

### Symbols in English - Two Sets
#### 26 Symbols
>>+ Upper Case
>>+ Lower Case

#### Phonetics

+ when you see the two dots /:/ it means the sound is long
+ each symbol represents a sound
+ when you see this dash /’/ it means the next syllable is stressed

##### VOWELS
+ Short vowels

## Lec 03 - Speech sounds in English

>Vowels are *nearly free* flow of air, minimum obstruction from articulators.
> Consonants require obstructions to be produced, and so cannot be streched over a duration

### Articulation of Consonants
+ (A) aspiration -> extra aur flow.
+ (V) voice -> extraneous vibration of vocal chords.
+ Normal -> Nasal, produced by lowering uvula.

|&&| -V _ -A | -V _ +A | +V _ -A | +V _ +A | Normal
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Velar|k|kh|g|gh|nj|
|Palatal|c|ch|j|jh|ny|
|Retroflex|T|Th|D|Dh|N|
|Dental|t|th|d|dh|n
|Labial|p|ph|b|bh|m


## Lec 04 - Articulation of Vowel and Consonant sounds

### English doesn't have all consonant sounds, only 24.

----> toward the inside of the mouth

|&&| bilabial | labio -dental | dental |alveolar | post -alveolar|paletal |velar | gluttal |

## Lec 05 - How to Improve your Language Skills.

> Read from context, and do try applying rules from known Languages when the grammer seems alien.

## Lecture 06 - Telephone English

Greet->Purpose->Availibility Check.

## Lecture 07 - Language Learning and Use

>E-Language
>> External language, finite input from environment.

> Internal Language
>> Universal Grammer picked up in formative years, and paterns extended from it.
