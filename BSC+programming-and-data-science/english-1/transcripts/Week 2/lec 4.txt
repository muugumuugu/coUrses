What is Good Vocabulary - Part 1
Welcome to this module on Vocabulary. In this part of the course, we will talk about what is
good Vocabulary. A lot of people often say that an x or a y, a certain person, a gentleman or a
lady has a very good Vocabulary, what do they mean? Do they mean to say that they have
many words, they know many words or do they mean to say they know how to use the words
they know creatively to use them in a variety of ways?
Many people, many writers, many speakers in the world have been found to have known not
lots of words; people say that Shakespeare knew fewer than 30000 words only, even when
the English language had nearly 100000 words. How could Shakespeare then write so well
that he continues to be popular even today?
There are many writers who knew perhaps less but who wrote more or as much and continue
to be popular. No matter what we know, the moment we say we know a language, we say that
we know Vocabulary, we have Vocabulary. This is one of the first things we learn in a
language. We learn words first in a language. That is what attracts us; then we go to phrases,
then we go to sentences.
So, today and in the coming sessions, we will talk about Vocabulary, but today we begin with
what is good Vocabulary; how do we know that x has good Vocabulary, but y has not? What
can we do such that we can also have a good vocabulary? In the rest of this session today and
in the next, we will talk about good Vocabulary. Let us begin.

In very simple, very plain language, the meaning of the word Vocabulary is all the words; in
other words, our Vocabulary has all the words we know. It means it denotes; it indicates all
the words we know constitute our Vocabulary. It is a treasure which has only words, but all
the words that we know, that treasure is called, that box is called, that Almira is called name
it as you like is called Vocabulary rather than call Vocabulary, you can call it Almira of
words, you can call it a box of words, you can call it a bag of words, all that means
Vocabulary.
We not only know words, but we also know about words. We know, for example, take the
word 'cat'. We not only know what it means; we also know how it is spelt. We also know how
it is pronounced. We also know whether it is a noun or a pronoun, a verb or an adjective or an
adverb.
We also know many other things related to it. Take any other word, take a verb like 'read'.
We know many things connected with it. We know that it is a verb, we know its spelling, we
know what it means, we know how we can use it in a sentence. If two people read together,
then we called it 'read'. If only one person reads, then we do not say read, we do not say one
person read, we say one person reads.
So, along with our knowledge of the word comes knowledge of all the other things that are
related to the word its spelling, its meaning, its category, whether it is a noun or a pronoun;
whether it is a verb or adverb or adjective, whether it will be used with or without 's', whether
it has a past tense, a verb like 'read' of course has a past tense, but its form does not change in
the past tense, its pronunciation changes. You can say I have read all of Shakespeare, but
spelling remains the same.
So, when we say, when we claim that we know a word called read, we not only know what it
means, we also know how to spell it, we also know whether it is noun or verb, we also know
if it changes form in a sentence and we have seen just know, if it is only one person, then it
becomes reads, one person reads, John reads Bible every morning. Mary reads here email
every few hours in her office. So, one person, but when they are two people, John and Mary
read their Bible in the church on Sundays together, then we say John and Mary read.
So, along with the knowledge of the word 'read' along with the knowledge of its meaning, it
is category whether it is noun or verb, along with its spelling, also comes the knowledge of
how it is used. Also comes other bits of knowledge; we know how we can make other words
out of it. So, we know from the reader we can get the reader. We can say John is a reader to a
judge; John is a reader in a university, which means he holds a certain kind of position on the
faculty of a university.
So, there are all sorts of meaning; we also know that being a reader at a university has
nothing to do with read, it is a different kind of word incidentally it has the same spelling and
similar pronunciation. So, Vocabulary includes all the words we know and not only that it, it
also includes all that we know about these words.
Say for example, many people know only one language, many people in the world are
monolinguals, they know only either English or Chinese or French or Hindi or Spanish or
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
Vietnamese or Japanese, they know only one language and there is nothing bad about it. It is
not that those who know only one language are lesser human being than those who know
more. It is just a matter of chance that one happens to be born at a place where more
languages are used and one, therefore, usually learns more than one language.
So, there are some people who know two languages, some who know 3, some who know four
and there are people who more than four languages; there are many communities in India,
particularly in southwestern India places like Kerala, southern coastal Karnataka, Goa,
Tuticorin, Rameshwaram side, etcetera where people know at least 3 or 4 languages. But that
is the point, no one, no matter how many languages you know, no matter what your
knowledge of the world, what your knowledge of any one language, nobody knows exactly
how many words they know.
You can make a guess; you can say I know 50000 words; there is a safe guess that a college
graduate ordinarily knows between 30 and 50000 words. A child, a young child, by the time
the child is 5, the child knows about 5000 words. Older people, if you are in the business of
reading, writing, teaching, if you are a lawyer, chances are you know more than 50000 words
in the language of your work. But nobody can tell you exactly. I know 49978 words. Nobody
knows their knowledge in a quantifiable measure, particularly when it comes to the
knowledge of words.
But we know what we know. When we see a particular word, we know, 'arrey' this word
comes from Hindi or Malayalam or Tamil or Latin or English, quite often, sometimes we
may not, we also know the meaning, we also know lots of other things, but nobody knows the
exact number of words they know that somehow has not been possible though people have
tried, there have been attempts and people have generally found approximately near about
you know so many words. Next.

You know, look at their language behaviour, look at people's language behaviour, there are
people who understand and who understand and who can speak nearly all the words they see,
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
all the words they hear, they know those, they do not know to look up a dictionary, but there
are others in the same community, sometimes in the same family. God has created us all
equals with some differences. Some people say that in the factory of God, there is mass
production, but each piece is unique.
So, it is possible that in the same family there are some people who have many more words,
who know much more than other members of their family. Just as it is possible that there are
some members within the same family, within the same faculty who know just about a
minimum and no more, so, that you know a particular language does not mean that you know
so many words, it only means that you know some words using which you can use that
language.
Just as some people can read and write, similarly some people can speak and hear. Some
people, just as some people can hear and read, some people can speak and write many words.
Some people may not; they may not write lots of words that does not mean they are
handicapped; it only means their Vocabulary is a quote on quote "restricted", but it does not
mean their word is restricted. With the same Vocabulary, with those very words, they do all
that someone with a large Vocabulary does; that is another good thing about knowledge of
words.
Words acquire new meanings, words can expand, stretch, you can use them the way you like,
they are so flexible, but we have different kinds of people. Some people have many words,
some people know many things about many words, there are others who may not have many
words, or sometimes they have many words and yet they do not know as much about every
word as some others do.
The point I am making is that all this knowledge with a lot of variety, with lot of flexibility,
lot of possibilities, all these knowledge constitutes our Vocabulary. Our Vocabulary is,
therefore, not only the number of words we know; it is also the other knowledge that we
have, which makes for Vocabulary. Next.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:04)
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
What are the other things? To be very precise, about each word, anyone who knows a
language, so, practically anyone who knows a language, also knows many words. We may
not be able to count them, but we know that we know many words about any subject, and we
know a variety of words so that in different situations, we can say the same thing in different
ways. So, you know the first feature of the knowledge of words, the first feature of
Vocabulary is knowledge of a number of words, knowledge of a variety of words.
The next is a number of similar and different words. So, for example, we not only know that
he is a teacher, we also know that he is a professor, we also know that he is a writer, we also
know that he is a preceptor, we also know that he is an instructor. Similarly, we know a
number of similar and different words, we know that she is a doctor, Mary is a doctor, we
also know, therefore, that Mary is a healer, Mary is a creator of well-being, Mary is a creator
of happiness, all of these things go together. So, we know a number of words, and we know a
variety of words.
Similarly, we know a number of way; we know for, any word we know more or less some
other words which are similar in meaning. For any word, we also know other words which
are totally different in meanings. We will talk about them. When we say we know a language,
we will have Vocabulary; we also know which word goes with which; if you have drink, then
it will, it is followed only by water, not by rice. We do not drink rice in English, you do not
drink air in English, you do not eat air in English, you eat solids in English, you drink liquids
in English, and you breath gases in English.
But there are languages where you can use 'eat' not only with solids but also with liquids. In a
language like Bangla, for instance, you can say I eat rice, you can also say I eat water, you
can also say I eat air, even in Hindi, you eat air, you sometimes also drink air. Though they
are idiomatic, the point I am making is when we know some words, we also know which
other words it can go with, which other words it will follow or precede, how it relates to other
words? We also know that.
The third feature, the first was a number and variety of words. The second was similar and
different words. The third is the way each word goes with other words. There is a place if you
have 'the' it is quite likely to be followed by a noun; if you have 'a' 'an', if you have 'an' it is
quite likely to be followed by a noun which is spelt with either a or e or i or o or u quite
likely. Sometimes there may be an exception, like when you can have a word beginning with
m, and you can still say an, he is an MA, he is an MLA, he is an MP. You can say that
because of abbreviations because the letter is pronounced 'm' where the sound 'a' is there.
But generally, when we use 'an' then it is followed by a noun and it is followed by a, it is,
sorry it starts, it is ay spelling begins with either a or e or i or o or u, a e i o u, a or e or i or o
or u, one of these letters. It is possible that 'an' is followed by an adjective, you can see an
elegant house, but 'an' here is a reference to house, which is a noun, but because it is
immediately followed by elegant which starts with 'e', so rather than 'a' we have used the 'an',
we will talk about these things. But the point here is it is definite; it is fixed which word can
be followed by which other kinds of words. It is not that any word can go with any word,
then we will have chaos, then we might not understand the meaning of words.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
When we know a particular word, we also know how we can make new words out of them.
So, for example, you know the meaning of the word 'person', then you also know how you
can make a new word out of it, so you have 'personal' another word 'personalise', yet another
word 'personify', yet another word 'personality', yet another word 'personification'. Now all of
these words have been made by adding things to a word called person. So, when we know a
particular word, we also know how we can make new words out of it that is also part of our
Vocabulary.
And then finally, when we know a particular word, we also know how it can be used in a
sentence. So, for example, we said now said John reads books, Mary treats people, Mary
cures people, she is a doctor, John is a professor and John, therefore, reads books because
John is only one, so in read, we add 's' for John reads. Mary, one person, we add in word
treat; in the word cure, we add an 's'. So, all this is part of the knowledge that in a sentence,
this word can take this form in this context. That is also our knowledge of Vocabulary. Next.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:34)
Let us look at I said number and variety of words. In other words, we call them synonyms
and antonyms. All users of any languages know many words of this language. Say, for
example, all of us know essential words, we know the words for mother and father in any
language you know, but all of us may not know a word like parents, all of us know brother
and sister, but we may not know a word like siblings. So, if you only know essential words,
that is fine. But if you know more than what is essential, then you, then it can be said that you
have a good vocabulary, you have a large vocabulary. Go to the next.

(Refer Slide Time: 23:28)
Similarly, you know a lot of similar words, words which means similar. Say, for example,
food. Now related to food or words like meal, breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper, snacks,
cookies, savouries, sweets, fries, stuffed, I am sure you know more words than I can tell you
off. We also know more words than only food; I mean, if you know only food, then we will
say our, we do not have a very good vocabulary, but we know all of those words that we said
above, then we can claim that we have a better vocabulary. Next.

Look at this extract. Can you tell me how many words you can find here for friends? Take a
minute; how many words did you find here for friends? Go to the next.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 24:39)
So, in this context, the highlighted words Second C is a section, but in this case, it means a
group of friends, classmates, group of friends, faces, new faces, faces do not exist without
people. So, here faces has with the word faces has been used for friends. Chums, friends who
are so are so close that you share all confidential things with them; set, just like classmates, a
group of friends. So, those who know all these words can claim to have a good vocabulary.
Next.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:28)
So, words having a similar meaning, words that have similar meaning are known in the
language of grammar as synonyms, syno means similar, nyms meaning, words with similar
meaning. Say, for example, look at a word like 'road', how many words, how many other
words can you think of which have nearly the same meaning? So, you have avenue; you have
alley, you have lane and bilanes, you have a way and subway, you have path, thoroughfares,
street; I have not named them all; you can add to them.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
Now, in they do not mean exactly alike, alley is not the same thing as lane and avenue is not
the same thing as street, road is not the same thing as bilane, but they all mean public
thoroughfares upon which people can walk without restriction or without much restriction.
So, they have a great deal of similarity in their meaning. These are synonyms.
We have another example, all the words like abode, apartment, bungalow, flat, house, nest,
residence, villa, they can go for home. You can say I am going home; you can also say I am
going to my flat. I am going to my apartment in various context. So, a good vocabulary
includes a good stock of synonyms. Next.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:21)
Similarly, there are antonyms; we also know the words that mean the opposite. When we
know night, what is the opposite of night? We know day, we know a word called dark, what
is its opposite? It is bright. We know the word poor; we also know the word rich. Opposite of
the poor is rich. So, we also know antonyms. If we know friends, chances are quite often we
also enemies. Here, for example, I have said, what are the antonyms of friends? The
competitor, contestant, critics, enemy, foes, rivals, etcetera. So, friends and enemies, friends
and foes are antonyms. Next.

What you can do is to check whether you have a good vocabulary, and we talk, we will talk
further about it, we will further explain all the other things that we have said. But let us check
if we have enough synonyms and antonyms. So, I have given you these words, ask, bad,
good, student, teacher. How many words you know which means similar, which have a
similar meaning, synonyms and which have different, opposite meanings, antonyms. Make
your own list and check with the dictionary, check with the Thesaurus, check with the
answers we have given you. Go next.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:54)
Just as you know, we know we have dictionaries. Allow me to take a minute on this. Just as
we have dictionaries which gave you the spelling of words, meaning of words, category of
words, usage, pronunciation, similarly we have Thesaurus. A Thesaurus is a collection of
words, a grouping of words according to meaning. So, all words which mean good are
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
together, fine, nice, excellent, marvellous, splendid, outstanding; they are all together. All
words that mean bad, bad, evil, low, lowly, dirty, foul, they are all together.
So, Thesaurus is a collection of words according to meaning. A good writer should have, or
anyone who aspires to be a good writer should have both a dictionary and a Thesaurus. You
may have it on your laptop softcopies, they are available these days, or you can have them in
hardcopy traditional way, but it must be available, if you have, if you want to become a
public speaker, good use of language, a good writer of language, you must have these books.
