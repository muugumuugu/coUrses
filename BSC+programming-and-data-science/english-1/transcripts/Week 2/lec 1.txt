Consonant Clusters in English Words
Welcome to the class. Today we will look at one specific feature of English words.
Rather, it is better to say we will look at one specific features of words and this feature is
significant in English as well. We are going to talk about cluster of consonants in words, I
will explain this to you. I will explain how it works but right at the outset I would like to
draw your attention to the point that cluster happens in all languages of the world.
So, if you speak a language other than English you can check the language as well and
see how these things are working in your language as well and that will make it simpler
for you to learn about these things in English too. Please underline my words for that:
cluster works in all languages of the world, in the language that you speak natively as
well and an inbuilt knowledge about it from that language and your attention to that
phenomena in your language will be very much useful for you to learn the things that we
are going to discuss about English; its application of our subconscious knowledge in
making a new effort of learning a new language rather something about a new language.
Let us look at how it works in English. So, as you have seen so far, we have had a fairly
concise discussion on consonants and vowels. We know about these two types of sounds
in language. We know that these two sounds combine together to make a word. No
random sounds together make words. It has a specific sequence, as we know that a word
in any language including English is not possible without a vowel sound. It is required for
every word, rather, every syllable to have a vowel sound in it.
A syllable is a smaller unit of a word. It is larger than sounds but smaller than words.
There are some words which are monosyllabic in nature, so in such words the question of
syllables is not really very significant but in bigger words, larger words, words which
have got more than one syllable, discussion on syllable is also important.
Sometimes words have just a sound, so we are not talking about those words. Rather, we
are looking at conceptual discussion on such topics. Trust me on this, please go through
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
this discussion and it will have exponential impact on improving your language,
improving how you speak and needless to say, once you improve how you speak it adds
to your confidence and that results into impressive delivery in the target language, which
is the larger goal of this program.
(Refer Slide Time: 4:49)
So, let us move on to a discussion on that. So, as we have started, we are going to be
talking about consonants and vowels in a word. So, we will start with simple words. So
words have a sequence of consonant and vowel and I want your attention on this
particular slide specifically, because we are going to begin a discussion on consonant.
First, we talked about consonants and vowels and then we want to see a step beyond, that
is, how this sequence works.
So, look at this, we have simple words, simple combinations in this order that is CVCV
order. What does this order mean? Consonant, Vowel, Consonant, Vowel rather
alternations of these two types of sounds. We have huge number of words with this
sequence and please also note that when I say CVCV, it can also be VCVC. So, the point
is, one sound after the other, then again first then again second, that is the important part.
So, a word like 
papa
 is an example, I am not giving you kindergarten examples but to
begin with it is important to go slow and you can come up with your own list of words
with CVCV.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
But wait for a moment before you do that because this exercise that you are going to do is
going to be more interesting for you and I am positive you will enjoy this exercise no
matter at what stage of learning language you are. So, 
papa
 is a word. It has a sequence
of consonant, vowel, consonant, vowel and I am purposely not putting these words in
phonetic symbol because putting a word in phonetic symbol means we are going to be
talking about how we speak.
So, now what, we do not want to load you with the knowledge of phonetic symbols.
Rather, we simply want you to keep in mind that when we are talking about words, we
are talking about how we speak a word, learning to write, that is learning spelling of a
word is a completely different phenomenon and the things that we are going to underline,
things that we are going to ask you to pay attention to are related to spoken part of the
language.
Speak this word to yourself 
papa
. You are going to say it has sequence of two sounds
 consonant, 
 vowel, 
 consonant, 
 vowel; four sounds in it 
papa
. So, please do not pay attention to spellings alone, pay attention to the sequence of
sounds in which they occur. So, 
papa
daddy
. So what are the sounds here? Again four
sounds 
, as the vowel, 
 again as a consonant and 
 long vowel at the end of
the word. So four sounds, two vowels, two consonants, 
 consonant
 vowel, 
 consonant, 
 vowel. And this particular, I have tried to put it phonetic
symbols so that you can see this is C, this is V, this is C and this is V.
So, first vowel, the second sound in this word is a diphthong vowel, and last vowel 
a is an example of long vowel. So, which becomes clearer when you look at the phonetic
transcription of the word, that is, how we speak the word and it helps us dissociate
spelling of the word from how we speak a word. Same thing, 
mommy
, so this
vowel is actually like this 
 and 
 so this is consonant, vowel, consonant and
vowel. This is an example of the same thing that we were talking about.
So, large number of words in any language including English comes out of this sequence.
We also have sequence like CVC, which is basically a subset of the first one. You get
words like 
 and so many numerous of them, how many examples can I give
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
you. Once you understand this sequence, once you understand the sequence of, role of
this sequence in designing a word, creating a word or understanding a word, you will see
is the underlying structure of word formation in any language. Then we have VC or CV,
we can have a word with that as well.
So, we can we can see, we have words like 
 and
probably many more. You can change the sequence like you can have V and C sequence
and you can still get so many words out of it. Then we have words like CVV, that is, a
consonant and two vowels.
So, we do have words like 
, some people, this is the word determiner, some people
pronounce this word differently. I am sure some of them pronounce it as 
 a dental 
and long 
. So it is an example of either you can also say this is an example of basically
C and V, that is all right. C it this is again a consonant and vowel or so the basic point is a
word has alternations of consonant and vowel sounds in them. This is the basic example
that I am, basic conclusion that I want to take out of this little discussions that we have
had so far.
Please note, so if I say 1, 2, 3, 4, let us put them in sequence. So, 2, 3, 4 are in some
ways, subset of 1. You can also add another CV here, that is not a problem. The problem
is any other combination of alternations that we get out is going to be basically the subset
of what we see as number one.
So, if we can come up with a smaller rule, that a word is basically CVCVCV sequence.
At the very beginning, right at the first place this may not make sense but once you go
through the details of this, what you derive is a word is basically this and every other
combination is part of that. So, that is what we want you to draw your attention to.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 14:21)
So, that is one significant part and it is important to know right in the beginning as we are
beginning the discussion on sounds and their roles in a word. So, as you have seen, just to
refresh your memory since I have been talking about the consonants, consonants,
consonants, so just to give you some examples, please go back and refresh your memory.
 is a velar sound, a canonical sound in most of the languages of the world including
English, and here we are talking about English 
. It is a velar sound and that is the place
of articulation for the sound is velum therefore, it is called velar sound. 
 is also a velar
sound, as you know 
 as a sound is minus voice.
Let me write it as full, that is, there is no vibration in the vocal tract, in the vocal cords
and 
 is plus voice. Same thing here, 
 minus voice and 
 plus voice and both of
them are bilabial sounds. So, here we have some examples as, words like 
king
 has 
sound, words like 
class
 has 
 sound in the beginning of it, word like 
great
 has 
sound and 
glass
 has 
 sound, 
pink
 has 
 sound, 
pure
 has 
 sound, 
bliss
 has 
sound and 
bless
 has 
 sound in the beginning of it. We will come back to this slide
one more time.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 16:09)
So let us go back and look at on alternations. Look at some of these words like 
what
glass
sink
link
sing
. What do you find? Here is what I want you to do, please
look at, please pay close attention to these few words. I have just picked some random
examples of words and what I want you to do is to find out the sequence of consonants
and vowels in these words. I have already given here as examples, but for new words that
you find you can do it for yourself.
So, what do you see here? We see in a word like 
what
, you have a sequence of two
consonants without a vowel. In a word like 
glass
 you have a sequence of two
consonants 
 and 
 without a vowel. Also pay attention to how we speak the word
glass
glass
glass
. Again, please ignore the spelling for a moment: 
 at the end
of it is not really a sequence of two consonant sounds, it is just one consonant sound 
so, 
glass
Here in the second set of words 
sink
link
 and 
sing
 you have 
 and 
 as sequence
of two clusters without a vowel sound. So, here you have a consonant 
, vowel 
 and
 and 
 as two consonants and that is true for all of them, that is, at the end of the
word you find a sequence of two consonants. So when you find such a sequence this
sequence is called cluster, this is what we know as cluster, that is two sounds together.
What is the role of this? Why it happens in language?
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
What we need to understand is how it happens and how do we understand this
phenomenon, I just gave you an example of a word which is, there are words like
function words 
 which is just one sound. So we have we also have words like 
which has got two vowels which is also a word. So, that is to make the point that we do
have words only with vowel sounds but we do not have words only with consonant
sounds. So, that is, that is just to take you to the, to the beginning part of the sequence of
sounds in a world.
So, we will come back to this part and you will see the point, and I am purposely making
this point at this place just so that it will register for you: words are possible only with
vowel sounds, words are not possible only with consonant sounds. So, you can have a
word like V and V, or just a V but you will never have a word like just C and C, or C and
C and C that is without a vowel. You must have a vowel after this then this sequence is
possible.
So, now you could have guessed why I gave you this example of 
 and 
 because
they look like a cluster but that is not a cluster. Vowels do not make clusters, only
consonant sounds make clusters, and there is a specific reason for that and the reason is
the following.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:49)
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
Now, look at this when we say 
 or 
 or 
 and 
 just for example as consonants,
we see that these sounds, when we speak these sounds out of a word, that is out of its
context, we have to say, we hear a inbuilt vocalic sound 
 at the end of it 
. Take any example of a consonant sound not just the four that I have given you
here, you saw you hear a vowel sound at the end of these sounds. The way we put it is
that all consonant sounds have inbuilt vowel sound, one is specific vowel sound in it,
which is inbuilt in all vowels.
So, what happens in a cluster when you have CC two consonants coming together? The
way it forms a cluster is not just the sequence of two consonants next to one another.
What happens is the first consonant drops its inbuilt vowel sound from it and therefore
the two sounds in a sequence without the break.
So, when you say a word like 
glass
 it seems like 
 and 
 are together, it is not g-lass,
it is not g-lass, it is glass. 
sink
, it is not 
sinik
 it is not 
linik
. It is not, I mean it is even
tough to give you an example. The point that I am trying to make is when we say these
words, we hear no vowel sounds in between the two consonants and that is an example of
a cluster.
Hopefully it is clear to you that is what we mean by a cluster, should be clearer to you
and when you observe more from these examples and therefore, I do mention it every
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
now and then that please do observe these phenomena . Please do understand these things
in as much details as possible, and then they remain with you forever. You understand
them fully and trust me, it has exponential impact in the process of learning which is
largely a subconscious process.
So, what do you see here? In some words like 
what
 and 
glass
 you see the sequence of
these two consonants in, right in the beginning of the word, that is at the initial position
of the word. In the second sequence words like 
sink
link
sing
 we see the sequence
of two consonant sounds at the final position of the word, that is 
 at the end of the
word. So, what do we derive from here? Clusters in a word, that is, cluster of two
consonant sounds in a word may occur at the initial position as well as at the final
position of the word. That is all we have seen so far.
(Refer Slide Time: 24:55)
So, let us look at words. So as you can guess now on this slide all the words that I have
tried to put for you like 
king
class
great
glass
pink
pure
bliss
bless
 all
these words have cluster in it, that is, a 
king
, as cluster at the final position; 
class
, has
cluster at the initial position; 
great
, at initial position; 
glass
, again at initial position. In
words like 
pink
, cluster the final position; 
pure
, cluster at the initial position, here you
have a cluster of 
 and 
. In some varieties, like the English, the way we speak
English in India, it is also termed as Indian-English there is nothing offensive about
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
Indian English. It is English the way we speak in India, and I am not simply asking you to
be proud of this variety. It is a legitimate variety by itself. This is how we speak and there
is no way we can change the way we speak at a later stage in our life, that is after our
vocal tract has become matured.
So, in our language, in our English when we say the word, some words like 
pure
 this is
just an example, we hear a vowel sound 
 and 
. So that sequence is
different but in some variety like British or American or Canadian variety of English,
people can use this as a cluster and that there is nothing problematic about it. Some
words, we speak without clusters, some words some other people speak as clusters, that is
not a problem. There are a lot of words in Punjabi variety of English which does not have
clusters at all, where you will find clusters in Indian English as well: 
school
 becomes
sakool
 or 
station
 some speakers would say 
satation
Now, I do not mean to brush this phenomena aside in the passing. What I am trying to tell
you is it is important to know about the way we speak and it is perfectly fine. There is
nothing problematic about it. It is a legitimate variety. However, if we want to change
that, we need to know what we need to change and a discussion like this about accuracy
in learning is going to help you in that direction.
So, you want to speak a word like 
pure
 with cluster, you need to, you need to work on it
and then you will sound like speaking a cluster when you speak this word. So, for that,
you need to know what a cluster is and how it works. That is the purpose of this
discussion. So, in a word like 
bliss
, you have cluster the initial position; 
bless
, cluster
at the final position. One more time: you know that this is about that is 
 at the end of
words like 
class
glass
bliss
bless
 it is a matter of spelling. These are not
examples of clusters.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 28:57)
So, we have talked about clusters, we have introduced clusters. I think you understand the
phenomena of cluster and now, what I want you to do is to pay attention to the words;
whether a word has a cluster or not and if it has, at what position of the word it occurs,
what are the sounds possible in cluster. Not all sounds are possible in cluster.
So, one more time: to summarize that part please understand, two consonant sounds
together without the inbuilt sound are, this is the critical part, not just two sounds, not just
two consonant sounds together but two consonant sounds together without the inbuilt
vowel. In the first one is cluster which is also which we can put that same thing as
reduction of the inbuilt sound from the first one makes cluster.
The word 
cluster
 itself is an example of cluster, so look at it, it has two clusters and this
drew my attention and I thought I should give you an example. I have talked about two
consonant sounds as cluster in the initial position, in the final position; it is also possible
in the middle of a word, what you see here, it's also possible, cluster is also possible at
multiple places in the same world. Look at the 
cluster
, a sequence of two sounds in the
initial position and a sequence of two sound 
 in the middle of the world. So, the word
cluster
, two clusters in one word. So that is an example of a cluster.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
What you will notice when you move further is two sounds from the same place of
articulation do not participate in a cluster, that is, you will not see, look at these words.
 and 
 are making clusters, 
 and 
 are making clusters. In previous words that you
have seen, 
 and 
 and 
 and 
 again 
 and 
 these sounds are
making clusters, so 
 is a velar sound, 
 is a lateral sound, these are from different
places of articulations in our vocal tract.
But you will rarely see a two sounds from the same place of articulation, that is, two oral
sounds. This star means not possible. So this star means it is not possible, this sequence is
not possible, I am putting it in parentheses is 
not good
, meaning it is not a possible
sequence. So, you will not find a 
 and 
 making cluster in a world. If you notice
please bring that to our attention. 
 and 
 however is a good sequence. So, when I say
two sounds from the same place of articulation, I need to add a rider here, one can say
 is also a bilabial sound, but there is a distinction, 
 is a nasal sound, 
and 
 these are oral sounds.
So, the important point to note here is, two oral sounds from the same place of
articulation is not possible in the cluster. I will wait for some more examples if you can
find some. So, 
 and 
 and 
 possible, 
 and 
 possible, so that is possible
as sequence.
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
(Refer Slide Time: 33:15)
This knowledge about, so now before I conclude that, I want to tell you to note clusters in
the words, even if you have to spend half an hour time to find some words which possibly
has clusters, please do spend time on that and see the things that we have discussed are
applicable to those words or not. See how we speak those words and see if what we have
discussed can help us improve those words in any way.
Before we conclude, I want to give you a specific example of a specific phenomena
which we can understand through cluster. This is called assimilation. Look at this, in
some words like this, the word, look at the word 
impossible
 and I want your attention
here. So, we have a negative prefix 
 is a negative prefix and look at another word
incomplete
. Here also, 
 is a negative prefix. So, us paying attention to this particular
part is going to help us improve our pronunciation as well and once we know and we pay
little bit attention to this, we fix this thing forever in our learning.
So, in the negative, in the first word, let me give them numbers, in the first word
impossible
 negative prefix gets a labial sound because the following sound is a bilabial
sound. 
 is a bilabial sound, so the negative, the consonant sound in the negative prefix
assimilates itself according to the first sound of the word it is going to negate. So because
 sound, it becomes 
 and then we get 
impossible
. This is, I do not want to use a
heavy word for this, you can read about it this kind of thing is called assimilation, that is
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
when one sound changes, forces itself to change under certain kind of pressure in a
particular environment, then it is this such a thing is called assimilation. You do not need
to remember this thing, rather you only need to pay attention to what I am asking you
where I want your attention because this has implications for improving our
pronunciation and it has also implications for understanding clusters.
So, 
impossible
. Here it sounds, 
 negative prefix, sounds as 
 because of the word
possible
. In words like 
incomplete
 you will get to know that it is not 
incomplete
, that
 sound is not a dental 
. It is not 
 in, it is not 
 as in 
. Rather it becomes 
a velar nasal in presence of a velar sound 
 which is this one, so look at this. So, it
becomes 
incomplete
incomplete
. In our English we can also say 
incomplete
, we can
train our vocal tract for that it is possible but it sounds more impressive when you say
incomplete
. Whether, or not it takes time to reach there, more important is for you to
know this is how it works and then we get to know about very basic nuances underlying
construction of words.
So, I did not mean to give you just a definition of a word, did not mean to say words this
combination of sounds. We need to go into the details of that and need to look at what
those sounds are, how they work and only then we get to see the significance of our
understanding, the time that we spend on understanding vowel sounds, consonant sounds,
their places of articulations, why is it important to know different places of articulations
for vowel sounds.
It does not become apparent right in the beginning but once you see contextual
implication of such things and only then you can evaluate whether or not they have a role
in learning English for us or not. You may be wondering about the last word 
accident
This is an example of a cluster, just give you a cluster out of the context here because the,
in a word like 
accident
, often we think as 
 and 
 are making cluster. Actually it is
not because these are at syllable boundaries. 
 is at the end at the final position of the
first syllable and 
 is at the initial position of the second syllable.
So, it is not really a cluster. This is, this example just I gave you just for you to
understand and close the discussion with cluster and it will become clearer as we move
www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/
forward and talk about other significant parts that are going to help us improve our
learning, that are going to help us improve about our understanding of the nuances of
English language. Thank you so much.
