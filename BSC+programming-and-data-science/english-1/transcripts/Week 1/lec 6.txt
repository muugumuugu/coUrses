Telephone English
So, when it comes to a telephonic conversation, you either make a call, or you take a call. When
do you make a call? You make a call by dialling the person's number and then the phone rings.
When the phone rings, the person picks it up, and that is what is known as taking the call. So the
situation that invites you to make a call could be formal. When do you make formal calls? When
you have to make calls to your boss, to your office colleagues so all of this can be categorized
under the formal calls.
Whereas when you talk to your family members when you talk to your friends, all of them can
be seen as informal calls. So, let me give you a small example. I will tell you how you should
start a phone conversation in both formal and informal context. So, you start by greeting, and
then you introduce yourself. So, an example of formal context Megha is working for Air Voice
Services, and this is how she is starting the phone conversation.
She starts by greeting, saying hi; hello, this is Megha from Air Voice Services, or she could also
say, my name is Megha I am calling from the Air Voice Services. When it comes to informal
calls, let us suppose you are making a call to your friend, you did not start the way you started
for a formal call right, you would not say my name is this, and I am calling for XYZ purpose.
You would start with hi; how was it going or you would say hi; how are you? Or hi what's up?
How do you respond to those questions? You may say good. Thanks, what about you? Or you
could say good, thanks; how about you? Or you could also say not much, the usual; how about
you?
Now here is another situation and that situation is when you have to ask for someone. So, again I
am going to divide it on the basis of formal and informal context. So, let us suppose in a formal
context. You want to call your friend Padmini; you make the call. So, making the call to her
office number and somebody else her colleague has picked up the call. So, how would you
phrase that? How do you ask for Padmini?
You may say; may I speak to Padmini? Or could I speak with Padmini? Or I would like to speak
to Padmini. You may also add please at the end of the question or the sentence. So, in that case,
you may say; may I speak to Padmini please? Or could I speak with Padmini please? Or I would
like to speak to Padmini, please. Now if this is an informal context let us suppose Padmini is at
home but she has not picked up the call instead her sister who is a good friend of yours as well
picks up the call, so how would you ask for Padmini? Hi, is Padmini around? Or you would ask;
is Padmini there or can I talk to Padmini? So, there you do not have to be formal, you do not
have to add please at the end of these questions.
Now getting to the purpose of the call, so once you greet you ask for someone what next? Then
you tell the person why you call him or her for. So, again in a formal context, you could say; I
am calling to ask about I am giving you an example, let us suppose you want to know more
about some software consulting services. So, you could say; hello, I am calling to ask about your
software consulting services, then you could continue the conversation saying; could you tell me
and so on. Could you tell me how much it costs?
Whereas in an informal situation, let us suppose you are calling your friend, you could just say;
hey, I just wanted to ask if you are free to meet sometime this weekend. Hey, I just wanted to
know if you are available for a movie this weekend. So, that is how you get to the purpose of the
call.
Now checking on their availability, again let us suppose we are going to divide it according to
formal and informal context. In a formal context, you are making a call to your friend, and she is
in the office. You are making a call to her office number, and she is not around somebody else
picks up the call, and then they say that this person is not around, so how would you ask for that
person's availability, you could ask when would be a good time to call her or if you are talking to
the person directly if your friend says that look I have a board meeting now, can we talk later.
Then you could say; when would be a good time to call? Or if someone else has picked up the
call for her, you could ask when will he or she be back, or please let me know your best
convenient time or please let me know her best convenient time for a call. And in an informal
context like I have already said if Padmini sister has picked up the call and she is saying that you
know Padmini is not around. The next question that you can ask you know checking on the
availability is, do you know when she will be back.
Now leaving a message, how do you leave a message? So, Padmini's sister says, look she is not
around, should be back maybe in a couple of hours. So, you feel okay, in that case, let me leave a
message for her. So, what are the things that we can say in that context? Let us check it out using
a phone conversation. So, listen to this conversation, this will help you understand the different
phrases and the questions that we can use in this context.
Telephone caller 1: Hello, could I speak to Padmini, please.
Telephone caller 2: I am sorry she is not around.
Telephone caller 1: Oh, that is alright, I would like to leave her a message, could you please take
a message for her?
Telephone caller 2: Yes, of course.
Telephone caller 1: Or you may tell Padmini that Meera had called, you could also ask her to call
me back.
Telephone caller 2: Sure, I will tell her.
Telephone caller 1: She can reach me at 7708645321.
Telephone caller 2: Oh wait a second please, let me grab a pen and a paper to make a note of that
number. Could you please repeat your number?
Telephone caller 1: Yes, sure. My number is 7708645321.
Telephone caller 2: Okay, fine, noted.
Telephone caller 1: Okay, thank you. Bye.
Now, taking a call. When do you take a call, when your phone rings, you take a call. You could
also say you are picking up the call. So, again we will look at both informal and formal context.
First, the formal context, let me give you a context. So, Megha was working for Air Voice
Services, and a lot of customers call her to enquire about various plans and various customer
services. So let us see how Megha introduces herself after picking up the call.
So, you could say, so Megha could say; Good afternoon, Air Voice Services; Megha speaking or
she could say; Hello, Good afternoon, Air Voice Services, how may I help you? Or she could
also say; thank you for calling Air Voice Services, this is Megha, what can I do for you today?
Or it is also possible that she could say thank you for calling Air Voice Services, this is Megha
how may I help you or what can I do for you.
Now we will listen to a phone conversation and understand this process better. We will know
how to use certain phrases and sentences or the different kinds of phrases and sentences that you
can use when you take a call.
Telephone caller 1: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Air Voice Services. How may I help
you?
Telephone caller 2: This is Kavita calling from Madipakkam. I had recharged my phone with an
international roaming plan which I see is still not activated.
Telephone caller 1: Okay, please hold on mam, I will put you through the technical team.
Telephone caller 2: Okay.
Telephone caller 1: Hello mam, it was a technical glitch from our side, sorry for the
inconvenience caused by the delay. The team has worked on it. The plan will be activated in 15
minutes, anything else that I can help you with?
Telephone caller 2: No, nothing else, thank you so much.
Telephone caller 1: Thank you, have a nice day.
Now asking who is calling. Suppose, you are not familiar with the voice, in that case, you could
ask, 'May I know who is calling or may I ask who is calling or could I ask who is calling or who
is calling please or who am I speaking to please?' And then you can also follow up the question
where are you calling from, please? However, if the voice sounds familiar to you, then you could
say; hello is that Padmini? So, I hope I made this part clear; these are all the questions that you
can use in order to ask or know who is calling.
Now, asking to wait. Again will listen to another phone conversation; this will help you
familiarize with certain questions and certain sentences and phrases that you can use to ask the
other persons to hold or to wait.
Telephone caller 1: Hello, can I speak to Meera, please.
Telephone caller 2: Could you hold on, I will check if she is around.
Telephone caller 1: Yeah, sure.
Telephone caller 2: I, sorry to keep you waiting, Meera has gone to the nearby temple with her
grandmother, she is not around. Do you want me to take a message for Meera?
Telephone caller 1: No thanks, I will buzz her tomorrow morning.
Telephone caller 1: Hello, this is Nitya sister Ananya speaking.
Telephone caller 2: Oh, hello Ananya yes I remember Nitya telling me that you wanted some
inputs in the new BSc course launched by IIT Madras.
Telephone caller 1: Yes, is it a good time to talk?
Telephone caller 2: Ananya, I am tied up at the moment, can I call you back in an hours time?
Telephone caller 1: Sure, please call me at your best convenient time.
Telephone caller 2: Okay, sure. Bye.
Telephone caller 1: Bye.
Could you hang on, could you hold on, would you mind holding please, hold on let me grab a
pen and a paper, sorry to keep you waiting, sorry he is on the other line, could I take a message,
could I leave a message, I am tied up at the moment, can I call you back in an hours time, if it is
not urgent can I buzz you later in the evening, you just have 2 minutes be quick and what you
have to say or I would not be able to have a long chat as I am driving now. This conversation
will take longer; can I call you later. All these based on the context. These are all the sentences
you can use based on a different context, based on the context that you are in.
Now on receiving a second call, let us suppose you already on a call with someone, and you are
receiving a second call, what are the phrases that will come, phrases and sentences that we can
use or that will come handy to you when you receive a second call. You could say; I am
receiving a second call could you hold for a second or could you hold for a minute, you could
also say I am speaking to someone on the other side if it is not urgent can I call you in sometime?
You could say I am getting a call from my professor; I will have to answer. I will call you back
soon.
Or again depending on the context I am getting a call from my family, or I am getting a call from
my dad, I am getting a call from my office, I will have to answer this I will call you back soon.
Or you could also say, please hold on for a second; my boss is pinging me. Please hold on for a
second; my boss is pinging me. What is pinging? Here ping is a synonym for a call, so instead of
saying my boss is calling me, you could also use my boss is pinging me.
So, now coming to conference calls. What are conference calls? What is a conference call? A
conference call is a call that you make to multiple people at the same time. So, you put people on
a conference call. So, I am giving you a situation here, here Ram is talking to Geeta, and that is
when Sita is calling Ram, and they all want to discuss the office work. So, Ram says, and he says
this to Geeta; look Sita is calling me or he could also say; look Sita is pinging me, can I get Sita
with us? So, Geeta says, of course, we would like to discuss this with Sita as well. So, he says,
wait a second, let me rope in Sita into this call.
This is important, rope in. Let me rope in, and then you tell Sita, i.e., Ram tells Sita that I am
having Geeta with me on the other side, I am patching you in. Meaning, I am adding you to this
call with Geeta. And once he does that to confirm whether he is audible to both of them, he says
Geeta and Sita, am I audible to both of you? So, he is asking both of them, am I audible?
And once the conversation begins and they discuss over about the project then Ram says Geeta
please stay on the line, Sita could you disconnect, I will call you later. So, they discuss whatever
is required with Sita, so now Ram feels that Sita could disconnect and he needs to talk more with
Geeta, and therefore, he ends up saying Geeta, please stay on the line, Sita you could disconnect,
I will call you later.
Now, let us talk about phone problems. We all encounter, or we all have difficulties hearing the
other person from time to time. Right? When we make a phone conversation when we make
phone calls with friends, families and colleagues and both formal and informal context. What are
the sentences that can be used in such situations, so I am giving you one situation and this is
where Geeta cannot hear the other person, and she is not sure if the other person is on the line?
So, in that case, she may ask hello, are you there or hello can you hear me or hello, am I audible
or hello, is my voice clear enough, hello, can you hear me loud and clear, hello, is my voice too
low? So, these are all the questions that you can ask if you are not sure whether the other person
is on the line or not.
The second situation is where Lena is on a phone conversation with Anjali, and Anjali realizes
that she is running out of charge. So, her phone is going to die soon. In that case, what are the
sentences that can be used? She may say, please be quick, my battery is about to die, she could
say I might lose you so soon, lose you soon, as I am on 1 per cent battery. She could also say my
battery is about to drain, please text me or can I call you after charging my phone? Or let me
grab a charger and call you back.
Now let us look at the third situation, that is when Geeta is not able to hear the other person
properly. We must all have encountered this situation multiple times when we make phone calls.
You either hear your own voice or you hear the other person's voice is echoing or surfacing back
or you hear them in bits and pieces. So, what are the sentences that we can use when you cannot
hear the other person properly?
So, one we can say hello, I can hear you on and off. Then the second sentence is hello; your
voice is breaking. You could also say your voice is jarring. When do you say your voice is
jarring? When many a time we end up hearing some kind of vibrating noise and that is what is
known as jarring. So, you could say your voice is jarring. The next one is hello, I can hear you,
but in bits in pieces. The fifth one is, hello, your voice is echoing, that is when the voice surfaces
back or sometimes you could hear you might hear your own voice. In that case, you could say
look my voice is echoing let me cut the call and call you back again or you could also say hello, I
think you got cut off.
Now, the other phone problems are when you just hear a beep sound that is when you say I could
not get through that number or when you hear multiple beep sounds maybe it could also mean
that the other person is busy or engaged. In that case, you could say looks like the line is busy I
will call her later, or you could say the line is engaged, she is talking to somebody else I will call
her later. Or if there is no sound at all, you could either say looks like the phone is dead or you
could say she is unobtainable or the line is unobtainable.
Now there is another instance which is the wrong number; the other situation is the wrong
number. So, rather than saying wrong number which we generally tend to say, you could say,
sorry I think you have got the wrong number or you could say there is no one or none of that
name here.
Now, how do you end a call? If it is a formal situation, then you could say, okay, no problem I
will try again later. This is when you call for someone, but that person is not around and your
friends, colleague is telling you that she is not around. So you could say, no problem I will again
later, or if you are on the receiving end and if your friend's friend has asked you to pass on a
message. You could say, okay great; I will pass on the message.
And then informal phone conversation you could say it was a great conversation let us connect
regularly or take care, let us be in good touch. Or take care. Goodbye. Now if there is a
connectivity issue or you get another call you want to hang up, then what are the sentences that
you can use in that context? You could say, I might lose you soon there is some connectivity
issue here. I might lose you soon there is some connectivity issue here. Then you could say I
need to hang up now, let us continue the conversation tomorrow.
You could also say it's been an hour we are talking I need to get back to work or listen, my class,
is about to start I will talk to you later, this is when you have to cut the call abruptly
and again
based on the different context. So, I hope you have picked up a few phrases and sentences that no
will come handy to you in phone conversations. With that we come to the end of the module, I
will meet you with a different module on a different day until then stay safe, take care. Bye.
