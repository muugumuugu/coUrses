Articulation of Vowel and Consonant Sounds in English
Welcome to the class. Today we will talk about Articulation of Vowels and Consonant
Sounds. As you know, vowels are the sounds which are produced with minimum
obstruction of the exhaling flow of air in the vocal tract and consonants are the sounds
that are produced with different kinds of modifications at different points in vocal tract.
With this working understanding of consonants and vowel sounds, we want to look at a
description of English vowel sounds and consonant sounds.
At the same time, we will look at a comparative study, comparative understanding of how
certain sounds are different in our languages and certain sounds are very specific to
English and the way we understand that, in order to make our speaking better, in order to
make changes in the way we speak, we need to pay attention to certain sounds to make it
impressive and fluent and that is what we are going to look at today.
So, these are we, these are some of the vowels, some of the fundamental vowel sounds
which has three pairs in them and they have long and short alternations like 
. These are just six fundamental vowel sounds which are, which are available
in almost all the languages of the world.
And then you can look at 20 vowel sounds of English in these words and this is how they
are represented with phonetic symbol. We do not need to pay much attention to phonetic
symbols, however it is just good to understand, but important point is looking at these
words and paying attention to the vowel sounds in these words and we have 20 examples
of different vowel sounds in English with example of different words on this screen with
you.
So, they are 
book
mother
bean
burn
 and 
barn
just some of them, at least 10 examples. So, where we need to pay attention is in the word
 we have short 
 pit; 
 the vowel sound is 
 the vowel sound is 
the vowel sound in this word is 
 a short 
 in but; 
book
 shot 
mother
sound in this word; 
bean
 long 
burn
 short 
barn
born
So, if you look at words like 
born
 you will see the differences in these vowel
sounds and these vowel sounds are specific to English language. 
Boon
 has long 
So, what I am trying to tell you is there are lot, we do not need to look at how these
words are written in with their spellings. We are looking at how certain sounds work in
these words when we speak these words. So, these are, you can do this exercise for
yourself multiple times. These are examples of 20 vowel sounds.
Now, let us look at this chart. This chart does not have all 20 vowels in it but it has many
of them and it is like this picture. Imagine this whole thing in our mouth and thus you
will see, then when they say front, center, and back, will make sense. So, these vowels
like 
 is front wall, the vowels here are central vowel and vowels here like 
 back
wall.
Similarly, according to the tongue height, they are close, mid and open. So
basically, this picture gives you distribution of vowel sounds and sort of their places in
the vocal tract, in the oral cavity.
Now, we need to look at certain aspects of consonant sounds before we look at specific
details of consonants of English. So, we understand certain things like there are places in
our vocal tract which are responsible for different sounds like velum, palate, alveolar
ridge, teeth, and lips. So, when we have sounds from velum they are called velar sounds,
sounds from palate they are called palatal sounds, sounds from alveolar ridge are called
retroflex sounds, sounds from teeth are called dental sounds, and sounds from lips are
called bilabial sounds.
We have looked at some of the examples of these like 
 as an example of velar sound,
 as an example of palatal sound, 
 as an example of retroflex sound, 
 as an
example of dental sound, and 
 as an example of labial sound. And then we looked at
the distinction between oral sounds and nasal sounds.
At this point I want to specifically point it to you that this entire range of retroflex sounds
are not available in English and we are going to discuss the implications of this and the
way some of these sounds are produced in English. This much of fixing will help us
improve speaking to a great extent.
So, before we go to that, let us look at one specific thing. So, as we know on this vertical
axis we can describe sounds of natural language according to the places from where they
originate or places of articulations. Now, if we know, so let me describe the following to
you. If we know 
 is a velar sound and 
 is a velar sound too, 
 is a velar sound as
well, and so is 
 but these four sounds have their own distinctive identity, how do we
describe the differences between these sounds?
If we pay attention to two specific features, they are going to help us understand the
differences between these sounds quite clearly and these differences are... So what is the
difference between 
 and 
? We see, when we speak 
 we have little additional
flow of air and this sound says 
. You can put your palm right in front of your mouth
and when you say the two sounds one after the other, you can see additional flow of air as
part of blow on your palm. That is called aspiration and as I want to underline it again.
The idea of description here is not that you do not know these sounds. The idea is to pay
attention to the distinction, to the differences between these sounds and there is nothing
embarrassing about it to do these tests without laboratory for yourself so that you get the
differences once for all and then you can evaluate the differences between sounds of the
language that you primarily speak and the sounds that you are going to be specifically
careful about when we want to improve speaking of English.
So, this additional flow of air, this additional flow of air in the form of small little blow is
called aspiration. So, if we make the difference between these two sounds in terms of
additional flow of air, we see no aspiration with 
 which is here indicated as minus
aspiration and this one with additional flow is called plus aspiration. So, this much should
be good enough to give us the distinction between these two sounds 
 and 
Now, how do we make the distinction between 
 and 
? There is yet another
difference between the two and this is quite specific and it is little more difficult to notice
than the distinction between 
 and 
 because 
 and 
 had additional blow,
additional flow of air which can be realized externally.
Now, let us go back to this picture again and within this glottis, you see within this vocal
folds, we have, this is vocal fold, and this has vocal cords in them. For some sounds, this
cord vibrates little more than usual and that vibration is technically understood as
voicing. So, the difference between 
 and 
 is when we say 
 we do not have vocal
cords within the vocal folds vibrating additionally, whereas 
 has little bit more
vibration which is realized as resonance.
So, sometimes if you put your hand in this area of this, this is the area where we have
vocal fold and vocal cord and if we put your palm on this and then we say and 
 and 
one after the other, 
, then we hear, we feel that resonance on the palm. For some, it
may not be clear, but again you can do this experiment to yourself and realize it. If it does
not become apparent, you just need to understand it in the following way, in this
particular way to understand the distinction between these two and thus we get the
difference between 
 and 
. So, 
 is no vibration, so minus voice; and 
 has
vibration, so it has plus voice.
So, on this axis if you see and if we put these two features together then we can give
distinctive identity to these sounds like 
 is no aspiration, no voicing; 
 is aspiration,
little bit of additional flow of air and no voicing; 
 is no aspiration but voicing, that is,
vibration; and this sound 
 has both aspiration and vibration. Thus we see the
distinction between all these four oral sounds from one specific place of articulation that
is velum. These sounds are velar sounds and if we look at these features then we get their
identity and thus these 20 sounds, 20 oral sounds get specific identity.
So, if you say no aspiration and no voicing but from lips, that can only be 
. So labial
non-aspirated, non-voiced sound, it is only one that is 
 and as we know these are nasal
sounds. There are certain specific things that we need to know about nasal sounds which
we will discuss at a separate point.
So, now we understand these sounds, all these 20 orals and 5 nasal that is 25 sounds are
parts of our languages. Most of them are spoken in India but not all these sounds are
available in English. Like I mentioned, the retroflex sounds, that is, the sounds which
come from alveolar region when the tongue folds backward and tip of the tongue unfolds
and hit this alveolar ridge. This sound is not available in English.
So, when we go to the English consonant chart and try to look at different places of
articulations and we try to understand the way they are produced that is their manners of
articulations, then we get this idea that 
 and 
 are labial sounds and they are both stop
but one is non-voiced the other is voiced. 
 is a nasal sound. Now, rest of it you can
you can figure out. I want you to look at carefully is this one 
 specifically. We do
not have retroflex sounds in English. English 
 and 
 are alveolar sounds.
So, let us go back to this picture one more time. How do we produce English alveolar
sounds? Tip of the tongue without getting folded and without this folding and unfolding
gently touches the alveolar edge ridge and we get 
. So it is not retroflex, it is a straight
simple alveolar sound without retroflexion. For many of us, it becomes tough because a
close, a set of sounds that are very close to our languages are retroflex sounds. So when
we speak English, we tend to bring retroflex sounds in our English whereas retroflex
sounds are not available in English and this creates a big difference in the way we speak
and the way others speak.
It happens, it is not a problem, it happens to us because most of our languages have
retroflex sounds in them. If you are a speaker of Dravidian language like Tamil, Telugu,
Malayalam, or Kannada they are full of retroflex sounds. At the same time, if you are
speakers of Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Odia, Bangla
and numerous of them, these languages too have a lot of retroflex sounds. Please take a
note here, not as many retroflex sounds as we have in Dravidian languages but IndoAryan languages do have retroflex sounds. So, at this point everybody is in the same
bracket and because of availability of retroflex sounds in our languages, we tend to speak
English in a particular way which is sometimes called, or most of the time called Indian
English because one particular feature of Indian languages gets in our English.
At times, people do not like the term Indian English but trust me there is nothing
offensive about it. Indian variety of English, that is the kind of English spoken in
different parts of India, is named as Indian English, just as English spoken in America is
called American English or English spoken in Britain is called British English or English
spoken in Australia or Africa are called African English or Australian English. Just like
these varieties, we have Indian variety of English that most of us speak and these are the
reasons why our variety has a specific distinction of India in and this is called Indian-ness
in our English
One more time: there is nothing bad or offensive about it. I want you to understand this in
a very clear fashion that this happens to us because we speak our own languages, because
the vocal tract that we are discussing here matures before 12 years of age, and if we learn
a language after 12 years then we can still learn, we can practice sounds of a new
language but because our vocal tract has already matured according to the sound patterns
of our native languages it does not change and therefore we speak the way we speak and
thus there is scientific foundation for how and why anyone speaks the way they do; and
this is the reason why we need to understand it to sound very confident about how we
speak.
Having said that, it is also possible with regular practice to imbibe other sounds, certain
special sounds of other languages like non-retroflex variety of 
 and 
 which are
alveolar sounds. As I mentioned in the beginning the purpose of this description is for us
to know the distinction between our 
 that is retroflex our 
 that is retroflex and
English 
. Once we know this, it is easier for us to work on it and make it sound alveolar
when we speak English and may keep it the way when we keep it retroflex when we
speak either Tamil or Hindi or Punjabi.
Same way, I will give you one more example. Please look at this: 
 and 
, these are
two specific sounds in English which are very rarely available in our variety of
languages. For example, Hindi. The 
 sound in Hindi which was here, which is
aspirated, non-voiced bilabial 
 as in 
phal
phool
 is different from labiodental 
English as in 
father
French
friend
. All these words at the initial position have
got a sound 
 which is labiodental, where we have upper teeth and lower lip coming
together and thus we get labiodental sounds and this creates the distinction between 
and 
So, the idea is when you go through the two separate charts of consonant sounds that I
have described here with you, you can clearly see the difference between certain specific
sounds of English and the way we speak certain sounds which may not be available in
English.
To come to conclusion, these are the 24 consonant sounds of English and these 24 words
have got 24 consonantal sounds in them which you can practice for yourself and it is
important and imperative for us who are trying to improve, who are trying to make it
sound better, it is imperative for us to do this practice to understand the differences
between different sounds and to be familiar with 24 consonant sounds of English and 20
vowel sounds of English vis-a-vis the vowel sounds and consonant sounds that we have
in our languages. While doing so, you will also get to underline it for yourself that lot of
such consonant and vowel sounds are common as well.
So, do this maths, you will come up with a very small set of sounds, and working on
those sounds make us very, it becomes important, it becomes clearer to us that if we work
on these sounds, we can sound the way we want to in English. With this, we stop here.
We expect you to do this practice and then we come up with this exercise as well and
bring the questions to us which may arise out of this and then we will address them.
Thank you so much.
