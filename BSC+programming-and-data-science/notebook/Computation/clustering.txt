Approaches:
	Max # of clusters
	K-Means Clustering
		exactly k clusters, best clustering of this kind.
		1. Choose k:= how many clusters?
		2. choose k seeding centroids(this is going to be a accumulation pt) from the set
			maybe randomly choose them
		3. Voronoi each point wrt the current centroids.
		4. Choose the analytic centroid of the current clusterings.
		5. repeat 3
		6. do 4,5 until change is small.
	Hierchal Clustering
		Agglomerative:
			Globby
		1. Assign each item to its own cluster.
		2. Merge most similar pair of clusters.
		3. iterate 2 until required number of clusters is attained.
		Distance between Clusters:
			Linkage Criterion
				1. single linkage : shortest distance b/w members from self to other.
				2. complete linkage: longest distance b/w members from self to other.
				3. average linkage
