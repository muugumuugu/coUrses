some problems are inherently exponential.
Machine Learning:
	Inductive inference System
	Program observes examples representing **incomplete** information about some statistical phenomena
	and tries to 'fit the curve' generate a model to give information about unseen data.
Supervised ML:
	Training data is labelled, then we can teach the machine the features to associate with a label.
	Types:
		Discrete Labels - classification
		Intervaled data - regression
	Based on eg of training set, goal is to predict label of unbiased data.
	Parameters
		How accurate are labels
		How much does future depend on past.
		which feautures to consider
		feature extraction.
Unsupervised ML:
	Training Data **unlabelled**.
	It is about finding a structure in the data from the regularities observed.
	find the *"clusterings"*
	create some **feature vector**
		need to associate numerical values for nominal variables that preserve ordering and some sense of relative value.
	associate some wts for the features.
	establish a metric using this weighted feature
		Minkowski Metric
			apply on weighted and normalized feature vector
			dist(x1,x2,p)= ᵖ√(∑|x1ᵢ-x2ᵢ|ᵖ)
			p:= degree
	cluster so that there is
		low intra-cluster dissimilarity
		high inter-cluster dissimilarity
