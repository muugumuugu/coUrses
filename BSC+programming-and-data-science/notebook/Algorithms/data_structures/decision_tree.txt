====== decision tree ======
Created Wednesday 13 October 2021

any **comparison** algorithm can be viewed as a tree of all possible comparisons and their outcomes & the resulting return for any particular n.

==== example ====

=== binary search decision tree ===
for n=3

					 (A[1]<x?)
		   NO/                       \YES
	   (A[0]<x?)                   (A[2]<x?)
   NO/         \YES              NO/       \YES
|x≤A[0]|      |A[0]≤x≤A[1]|  |A[1]≤x≤A[2]| |x≥A[2]|

* every internal node of the deciosion tree corresponds to → binary decision in algorithm
* leaf in decision tree → return value of algorithm
* any path from root to leaf → single execution of algorithm
* length of downward root-to-leaf path → runtime of algorithm execution
* height of the decision tree → worst case running time
