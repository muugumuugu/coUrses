====== basic sorting algorithms ======
Created Tuesday 12 October 2021

===== Why Sort =====
searching efficient
	binary search
matching pairs, or finding statistical measures becomes easy.
data compression
	finds duplicates
rendering graphics
	front layer renderd first so as to not care about occluded objects in the back layeers.
	

==== Comparison Model ====

=== pointer machine ===
* all input items are black box ADTs supporting a single operation: comparisons
* time cost = # of comparisons

=== lower bounds on efficiency ===
1. searching
	a. claim : O(lg(n))
	b. assuming n pre-processed items, finding a given item.
	c. decision tree is binary since allowed operation - comparison, is binary, and must have ≥ n leaves so as to contain all possible return values → h =lg(n)
	d. runtime = O(h) ≥ O(lg(n))
2. sorting
	a. claim : O(nlg(n))
	b. decision tree is binary, number of leaves ≥ n! → height ≥lg(n!)=∑lg(i)≥(n/2)(∑lg(n/2))
	c. runtime = O(h)=O(nlg(n))
