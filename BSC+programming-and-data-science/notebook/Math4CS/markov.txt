If R is a non-negative random variable, then ∀x>0,
P(R ≥ x) ≤ E(R)/x
Pf:
	split into two cases:
	R is at least x = E(R | R ≥ x) ≥ x
	R is less than x= E(R | R < x) ≥ 0
	E(R) = E(R|R≥x)P(R≥x) + E(R|R<x)P(R<x)
		Theorem of total probability
	E(R) ≥ xP(R ≥ x)

1. If R is a non-negative random variable, then ∀ c >0
	P(R ≥ cE(R)) ≤ 1/c
	plug in x:= cE(R)
